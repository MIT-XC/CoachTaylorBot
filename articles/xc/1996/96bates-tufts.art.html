<FONT SIZE=4>The MIT Harriers made an unsuccessful trip to Bates
College to take on Bates and Tufts at Springbrook Golf Course.
 MIT expected to win for the 4th time in as many years, but instead
came away losing to Tufts and Bates by a score of 28 - 49 - 52
respectively.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The team was hoping to rebound from last week's disappointing
performance at the Dartmouth University Invitational.  Tufts ran
the race exactly the way MIT usually runs their races when on
hilly courses, which is to start out slowly, work up to the front
and take control after the last big hill.  MIT did not go out
exceptionally fast, and settled on a comfortable pace rather than
staying aggressive as Bates did in front and Tufts did from behind.
 When Tufts caught up, MIT could not respond.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Leading the way for the Engineers was Mike Parkins
'99 in 5th place.  Mike has been the #1 runner all season.  Fading
by over 25 seconds in the final mile, but holding onto 9th place
was Arnold Seto G.  Closely following Arnie was Leif Seed in 10th.
 Freshman Chris McGuire continued to surprise as he held on for
4th on the team and 13th overall. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Coach Halston Taylor thinks the team may have dead
legs from so much slow mileage with no real speed training, as
well as some poor tactical running.  &quot;The team will be taking
drastic measures to correct some earlier training problems and
get back on track.&quot;  &quot;We have 7 weeks before we really
need to be ready for the Championships, so I am not worried&quot;,
says Coach Taylor.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>This weekend the team travels to Cortland State College
in New York for a major invitational.  There will be over 30 colleges
involved and at least 3 of the top 10 ranked teams in the country
for Division III.  </FONT>
