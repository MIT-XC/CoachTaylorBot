<FONT SIZE=4> The Men's Cross Country Team embarked on the beginning
of a very difficult journey on Saturday.  Facing the most challenging
schedule in the last 15 years, the Techmen tightened up their
spikes for the season opener at the Dartmouth Invitational.  The
results of this first stop were dismal as MIT placed 7th out of
10 teams.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The intent of the new schedule is to force the team
to live up to their potential.  Last year, against a relatively
easy schedule, the team grew complacent and did not challenge
each other.  At the end of the season they had forgotten what
it was like to have to race.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> This first meet included very good Division I teams,
Dartmouth and Boston University, as well as Division III National
Champion, Williams College.  Others racing were the University
of Rhode Island representing Division I, Keene State and UMass/Lowell
representing Division II, and Bates and Brandeis in Division III.
 As can be seen, there was top to bottom quality at this meet.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> MIT followed part of their game plan, which was
to go out conservatively on the very hilly golf course, but the
second part was ignored.  The plan was to stay in contention while
being conservative.  The first MIT runner at the mile mark was
in 70th position at best.  The course was too difficult and crowded
to make up that much ground.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> So although the Techmen made up a lot of ground,
it left them quite spent by mile four.  The look on the MIT runner's
faces was one of total lack of focus; it is called the survival
look.  Instead of finishing the race well, MIT consistently got
out-kicked at the finish line.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Those running good times, but not necessarily good
races were Gus Blomquist (29:54), Frank Johnston (28:11), Ray
Molnar (31:05), Ryan Peoples (31:39), and Gabe White (27:54) with
a personal best.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Coach Halston Taylor says, &quot;things should improve
dramatically in the next two weeks.  If not, it will be a very
long season with the schedule that we have.  I know we have a
good team, but they have to develop more pride when it comes to
letting teams run all over you.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Next week the Engineers go up against Bates and
Tufts at Bates at 3:00 on the 21st.<BR>
