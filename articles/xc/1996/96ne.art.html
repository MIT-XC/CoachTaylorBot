<FONT SIZE=4> In the first race since the Alumni Meet, the Men's
Cross Country Team showed their potential.  Even though they started
a bit slow and got left at the starting line, Tech ran a great
race, placing 10th in the All New England Meet (3rd among Division
III Colleges).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Doing their best group running of the year, the
team gradually moved up from their poor start at about 100th position
to finishes of 52 - 75 for the top 5 runners (Mike Parkins '99
25:24 for 52nd, Chris McGuire '00 25:38 for 66th, Josh Feldman
'97 25:38 for 67th, Arnold Seto 'G 25:45 for 74th, and Leif Seed
'99 25:46 for 75th).  The most impressive part of this performance
was the 22 second gap between the 5 runners.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The successful running was not confined to the top
group.  15 of the competing 17 runners ran season best times.
 The most significant of those was a 57 second improvement by
Frank Johnston '00 who ran 26:48 to place 51st in the sub-varsity
race.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> With only 2 teams from New England qualifying for
the National Division III Championships, MIT must find a way to
improve enough to earn one of those positions.  Currently, the
engineers are seeded 4th behind Williams, Tufts, and Brandeis.
 The Regional Qualifier is in 3 weeks at Westfield State College.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Next week, the Techmen must defend their Constitution
Athletic Conference Championship at Franklin Park, which they
have won 5 consecutive times.  Race time will be at 2:00.</FONT>
