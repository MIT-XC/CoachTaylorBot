<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>Varsity Runs Away With Alumni Meet<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
 Saturday, at Franklin Park, the Varsity ran away from the Alumni
by a 15-27 score.  Due to a number of Alums who were unable to
make the contest, the meet was scored with the first 4 from each
team instead of the normal 5 runners.  However, the 5-7 runners
could be used to bump the oppositions score.  
<P>
 At the start of the race the lead group consisted of Ethan Crain
'95, Jesse Darley '95, and Varsity members Arnold Seto '96, Mike
Parkins '99, Leif Seed '99, Dan Helgesen '97, Josh Feldman '97,
Omar Saleh '97, and freshman Chris McGuire.  They came through
the relatively easy first mile in 5:12, but began to separate
shortly afterward. 
<P>
 By the 2 mile mark the lead back was down to 6.  Crain and Darley
were still there, but only Seto, Parkins, Seed, and McGuire were
still representing the varsity in 10:36.  The remainder of the
pack had fallen back to 10:40.  The other Alumnae, Sumner Brown
'66, and Rod Hinman '88, were settled a little farther back, but
moving up.
<P>
 Mile three saw McGuire drop back, although rumour has it that
he did so willingly because he remembered he was supposed to be
running with his group, to which he apologized when they caught
up.  The first real surge during the fourth mile.  Jesse made
a break and opened up a 30 meter gap.  However, just short of
the 4 mile mark he made a slight detour that cost him about 20
of those meters.  This move did serve to separate the group. 
 Darley, Seto, and Parkins came through 4 in 21:00, with Crain
and Seed close behind.
<P>
 The last mile was a real burner.  Parkins covered the ground
in 4:44 to win by 3 seconds over Darley.  Seto was another 8 seconds
back.  Crain and Seed were 4 and 13 seconds behind Seto respectively.
 Overall it was a great performance by all.  Four runners were
under 26:00, and 5 more Varsity runners were under 27:00.  Some
of the great performances were at least in part due to the great
weather, 60 degrees and overcast.
<P>
 The Varsity next competes at the Dartmouth College Invitational
on Saturday the 14th.  Race time is 11:00.  In addition to Dartmouth,
NCAA Division III Champ., Williams College will be there along
with Brandeis College.
