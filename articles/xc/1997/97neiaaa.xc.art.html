IN NEW ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIPS<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>

<FONT FACE="Bookman">BOSTON, OCTOBER 17 -- Racing on a classic
autumn afternoon, on a bone-dry, even dusty, Franklin Park, the
MIT Men's Cross-Country Team launched an assault on the school's
all-time time list for the standardized course. Eighteen of the
twenty-two competitors recorded personal best times, many of then
by more than thirty seconds.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">Team-wise, the Beavers placed 14th in a 36-team
field that included the best Division I showing in several years.
Brown took home the title with 55 points, with Dartmouth (90),
Boston College (118), and Providence (134) giving best pursuit.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">In the Division III arena, Brandeis continued
their strong running, placing 8th overall with 269 points (edging
out Harvard's 271) to start the D3 parade. Williams was 10th (274),
Tufts 11th (317), Amherst 12th (388) mainly on the strength of
Rob Mitchell's 3rd-place individual finish in 24:03, Bates 13th
(402), and MIT 14th (409). </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">The Beavers demonstrated remarkable team
running. Throughout the crowded field (251 runners), junior co-captain
Mike Parkins and sophomore Chris McGuire raced shoulder-to-shoulder,
pushing each other to personal record [PR] times of 24:58 and
25:00. Only Ethan Crain's 24:40 (good for 7th place) in the 1994
New Englands is faster on the MIT list. Both runners moved ahead
of Jesse Darley's 25:08, record in the same race (17th). McGuire
took 34th place to Parkins' 36th.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">Freshman Mark Strauss, who had run one of
his strongest races on this course in the Pre-Nationals two weeks
before, just didn't have all tumblers clicking and ran 25:50 for
91st. [His PR 25:34 would have netted him 70th.]</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">The next wave of Beavers was led by co-captain
Rich Rosalez's 26:16 PR (123rd), a 45-second best for him on this
course. Freshman Phil Loiselle (26:21 PR, 129th) continues to
impress, using his miler's speed to pull away from senior teammate
Sohail Husain (26:30 PR, 139th) in the final flat field. Sophomore
Frank Johnston once again flirted with his PR (set last year in
NE's, 16:48) but came up a few seconds shy (16:52, 163rd).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">The J.V. race continued the onslaught of
time breakthroughs, with freshman Liyan Guo setting the tone with
his 26:40 PR (by 1:34!) in 41st place (out of 222 runners). Sophomore
Ray Molnar just keeps getting better as well, with his 27:14 lopping
another 36 seconds off his personal best (Ray's best as a freshman
was 29:33). Another substantial drop was posted by freshman Ken
Walker, whose 27:36 clocking was a PR by 34 seconds, and a 1:32
improvement from the season opener.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">Other noteworthy bests were recorded by Jeff
Billing '01 (27:38), Ed Keehr '01 (28:02), indoor track co-captain
Chuck VanBuren '98 (28:04), Gus Blomquist '99 (28:22), and Ryan
Peoples '00 (28:28).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">The next race for the Beaver Harriers will
be Saturday, 25 October, in a 5000-meter clash with Bowdoin, Bates,
and Colby in Brunswick, Maine. The meet figures to a battle among
the 4th-, 5th-, and 6th-ranked teams in New England, with Bates
rated ahead of MIT and Bowdoin. The race begins at 12:00 noon,
and Bowdoin's Field House.</FONT>
