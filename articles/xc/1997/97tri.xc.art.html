GRAFTON, SEPTEMBER 20, 1997 -- The MIT Men's Cross-Country team
ran their record to 3-1 by splitting a tri-meet with Tufts and
Bates on Tufts brand new rural course at the Veterinary School
in Grafton.
<P>
 Tufts won their ground-breaking meet with 31 points, MIT took
second with 44, and Bates wound up third with 55.
<P>
 The meet was a measure of revenge for the Engineers after losing
to both teams at Bates last fall.  Entering the contest, Tufts
was ranked 3rd in N.E. Division 3 and 7th nationally, and Bates
was ranked 4th (24th in the nation), to MIT's 6th.  The Engineers
effort will surely move them up in the poll, and possibly into
the national picture as well.
<P>
 Team co-captain Mike Parkins '99 led the Engineers with a strong
second place finish, covering the challenging and hilly 5-mile
course in 27:11.  The time was far off his best for the distance,
but the difficulty of the terrain, coupled with the heat and high
humidity, kept times slower throughout the field.  Chris McGuire
'00 was the #2 runner in 27:29, placing fifth overall, and Mark
Strauss '01 ran a solid race to earn 7th (27:53).
<P>
 The first portion of the race saw a pack of Tufts runners move
to the fore -- polar opposite strategy from last year's race --
with a couple of Bates runners and MIT's top three in the mix.
 
<P>
 By the third mile, Bates' Justin Freeman had moved into control
of the race with Parkins at his side and Tufts' Jason Burke close
behind.  McGuire had fallen slightly off the pace and headed the
small second pack.  A few hundred yards behind him, MIT seniors
Rich Rosalez and Sohail Husain were working their way past some
fading Tufts and Bates runners, moving the team into contention.
<P>
    Freeman made his move before the 4-mile post, and opened a
gap on Parkins.  Mike's final mile is typically his forte, and
he matched Freeman stride-for-stride, but could not cut into his
lead.  McGuire hit four miles in fourth place, but was overtaken
in the final moments.  Rosalez finished his race strong, his steady
workman's pace bringing him up to 12th in the 64-man field, and
essentially clinching the win over Bates.  Husain ran a gutsy
race, making the effort to break away from a tight pack of four
Bates runners, but was overtaken by that pack in the final half-mile.
<P>
 Interim Head Coach Dick MacKenzie was generally pleased with
the team's performance.  &quot;The guys have better in them, I
know, but they gave a good competitive effort against two very
solid teams today.  We had several guys put up their best race
of the season -- not timewise, perhaps, but time is less relevant
in cross-country, especially on a new and unfamiliar course. 
We had much better competition today, and I think we rose to meet
it.  We were only six points down to Tufts at four miles, so I
have to think we should be looking for good things as we move
down the road.&quot;
<P>
 Other MIT runners who put up fine performances included Frank
Johnston '00, the team's sixth man, who closed to within six seconds
of Husain, and Phil Loiselle '01 who was only another four seconds
in arrears as number seven.
<P>
 &quot;We have a nice intra-team situation going on,&quot; said
MacKenzie.  &quot;Our top three race together well, and Rich is
solidly our fourth man, but then we have a real mix duking it
out for the number five, six, and seven spots.  Their scrappiness
in trying to beat one another will make all of them improve.
<P>
 Sophomore Ray Molnar and freshman Ed Keehr both made great strides
in the race as well, easily recording their best team finishes
to date.
<P>
 MIT hits the road to New York this weekend, taking in the highly
competitive Cortland Invitational at SUNY-Cortland.  A number
of the nation's top-25 ranked teams will be in attendance.  Last
year, the Engineers raced to seventh place in a 25-team field.
