FIELD<BR>

<FONT FACE="Bookman">Boston, October 4 -- Talented teams from
across the nation converged on Franklin Park for the National
Preview Invitational, hosted by MIT. In all, eight of the top
25 ranked Division 3 teams were in attendance, including four
of the top ten. MIT put up a solid performance, placing 6th overall
in the 15-team field, with 173 points.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">Perennial powerhouse North Central College
from Illinois, currently ranked #2 in the country, ran a controlled
race early on, then took command decisively, and romped to victory
with 32 points. The NCC scorecard showed a 1-2 finish, with two
more runners in the top eight. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">Brandeis University, ranked #6 nationally
coming in, secured second place with 83 points, with #10-ranked
Haverford (PA) College tallying 90 for third place, UC-San Diego
(#14) scoring 96 in fourth, and Tufts University (#5 in latest
poll) taking the fifth with 114.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">The Engineers began the race with somewhat
forced aggressiveness, as the field set a furious pace for the
first mile. Junior co-captain Mike Parkins led sophomore Chris
McGuire and freshman Mark Strauss through that point in 4:52,
and found himself behind a pack of 15-20 runners. The field swarmed
through behind them, and as MIT's second wave of senior Sohail
Husain, sophomore Frank Johnston, and freshmen Phil Loiselle and
Liyan Guo passed the mile post in 5:10, they found themselves
with a horde of runners to catch.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">Parkins worked ahead in the second and third
mile, moving up to 11th in 15:15 for 3-miles. McGuire got separated
in the crowd and found himself dropping 8 seconds his teammate.
Meanwhile, Strauss was hanging tough, just 3 seconds in arrears
of McGuire.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">Husain took charge of the second pack, pushing
his pace and pulling Johnston and Loiselle along in his wake.
The trio passed through 3-miles in 16:10, on solid PR pace, and
reeling in some of the more foolhardy entries.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">The final mile produced its usual fireworks.
Parkins maintained his hard charge, but was overtaken by one runner
and finished 12th in a PR 25:16 -- the third best MIT performer
since this course</FONT> <FONT FACE="Bookman">was standardized
in 1992. Only Ethan Crain's 24:40 and Jesse Darley's 25:06 in
the 1994 All-New Englands are faster.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">Strauss overtook McGuire around Bear Cage
Hill, and stormed to 23rd place in a PR 25:34 (#4 ever for MIT),
with McGuire 26th in a near-PR 25:40. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">Big PR's were posted by Loiselle (26:38 in
55th place), and Husain (26:41 in 57th), to close out MIT's scoring.
Johnston missed his PR by 3 seconds (26:51 in 61st). <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">In the Sub-Varsity race, PR's fell like bowling
pins. Sophomore Ray Molnar led the attack on the time list by
finishing 17th in 27:50, a PR by over a minute. Also bettering
previous marks by such a margin were freshmen Aaron Adler (20th,
27:56) and Ken Walker (24th, 28:10). Senior Chuck Van Buren, sophomore
Stanley Hu, and freshmen Ed Keehr, Albert Hung, Reid Anderson,
and Amay Champaneria all posted their all-time best clockings
as well.<BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">The Engineers' next contest will be on Friday,
17 October, at Franklin Park in the New England Intercollegiate
Amateur Athletic Association (NEIAAA) Championships. This race
features the best competition of the season, with Division 1 and
Division 2 teams lining up with we Division 3 squads to determine
where we all stack up in the New England scene. The Engineers
have historically run well against the elevated competition, as
indicated by the fact that 17 of our top 25 all-time best performers
at Franklin Park have run that time in the New Englands (four
of the remaining eight did so in this Pre-Nationals race).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman">The Varsity Race will start at 1:30, with
the Sub-Varsity squad toeing the line at 2:30.<BR>
