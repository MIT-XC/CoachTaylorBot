<P>October 22, 2000</P>

<P>MIT's men's cross country team tried their competitive luck
against the clubs of the region, and came away with an improved
effort over their previous race as they finished 8th out of 15
teams.</P>

<P>With four weeks before the national championships, MIT needed to
start running a little more like a top 10 team. In part, they needed
to run with a complete team, and second, they needed to run a
patient, intelligent race. They accomplished the former, but failed
at the latter. Ed Keehr returned to racing form, and Liyan Guo made
significant improvement in his second week back. However, the team
got pulled out a little too fast in the first 200 meters, and ended
up slowing down significantly between the end of mile one and the end
of mile two.</P>

<P>Dan Feldman, Tech's number one runner, claiming fatigue prior to
the start of the race, faded uncharacteriscally from 15th place to
46th at the finish. Making up for Feldman's woes, was Sean Nolan, who
was only :13 back. Keehr, running with Nolan for much of the race,
was only :06 behind Nolan. Alber Liu had a PR of :16 as he continued
to run better each week, and was :39 behind Feldman. Guo, running
with Liu for awhile, faded some, but held on to finish only :10 back.
Overall, the :49 delta was the best since the first meet of the
season. Sean Montgomery and Craig Wildman continued to offer support.
Sean ran over :30 faster than he did on the same course a week ago,
and Craig ran a personal best time by :15.</P>

<P>Next week, the Engineers host the NEWMAC Championship at Franklin
Park where they hope to continue to improve and get ready for the
national qualifier on November 11. MIT is the defending two time
champion, and the only team to ever win the men's championship.</P>
