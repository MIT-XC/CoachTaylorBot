CUP</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>September 8, 2001</P>

<P>The MIT Men's Cross Country team traveled to Saratoga Springs
State Park, the home course of Rensselaer, for the annual Engineer's
Cup. MIT ran out to an early lead and never looked back despite going
out a little too fast for the 80 degree conditions. Providing enough
depth to compensate for starting too quickly, MIT finished with a
winning score of 20 to 49 for RPI and 66 to WPI.</P>

<P>Both WPI and RPI returned 4 of their top 5 runners from last year.
With MIT losing 3 of their top 7 to graduation it did not seem likely
they would be able to duplicate their sweep of the top 5 places last
year. The MIT team planned on running in groups and doing most of
their work on the hilly course in the final 2 miles of the course.
Unfortunately, Dan Feldman, who was feeling ill the latter part of
the week, decided to run the way he felt instead of listening to his
body. Dan ran 5:12 for the first mile and paid for his effort,
dropping off to 5:47 for the difficult 3rd mile although he finished
2nd overall in the race. Sean Montgomery, reacting to last weeks
great race, also went out a bit too ambitiously, running 10:36 for
the first 2 miles and then 11:38 for the next 2 miles. This broke the
integrity of their group, forcing each to run his own race. Sean was
able to finish strong to hold onto 3rd place, giving MIT a 1-2-3
finish. Fortunately, Sean Nolan, who finished 1st, and Craig Wildman,
who finished 6th, ran superb races, deviating less than 30 seconds
for mile splits. Finishing out the scoring for MIT was Albert Liu,
who felt tired from the beginning of the race. Albert slowed after 2
miles but held on well enough to finish 8th overall.</P>

<P>Also running strong races for MIT were George Hanson (9th), Brian
Anderson (11th), Jeff Billing (14th), Ian Driver (17th), Carlos
Renjifo (18th) despite a wrong turn in the final mile which cost him
about 45 seconds and Alan Raphael (20).</P>

<P>Next week, MIT travels to UMass Dartmouth to run an Invitational
against some of the best Division III schools in New England.</P>
