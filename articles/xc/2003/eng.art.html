  <p><strong><font size="4">MIT ENGINEERS SWEEP OVER RPI AND WPI</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">September 13, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">Once Ben Schmeckpeper left the starting line he never saw another 
    runner until he turned around after going through the finish chute 25:34 later. 
    Likewise, teammates John Brewer, Kevin Brulois, Eric Khatchadourian and Brian 
    Anderson ran together and never saw an opponent after the start of the race. 
    The top five had a perfect score of 15 points to RPI's 48 and WPI's 84.</p>
  <p align="left">Tech placed eight of the first nine runners and 11 of the first 
    14 to totally dominate the meet. Despite going out a little too fast for their 
    plan, but not necessarily their abilities, the engineers ran an outstanding 
    final two miles to finish with many season and personal bests.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT ran well, but the overwhelming victory was due more to the 
    fact that RPI and WPI had graduated many of its top runners and were simply 
    not very strong. Next week, when the Tech harriers travel to the UMass Dartmouth 
    Invitational, they will most definitely face much stiffer competition against 
    nationally ranked Tufts University and Keene State College.</p>
  <p align="left">Many MIT runners posted personal bests in the mild, but muggy 
    conditions. Brewer's 26:28 for second place was a :27 PR despite blisters 
    received during the race. Freshman, Kevin Brulois, improved :31 to place third. 
    Grad. student, Chris Fidkowski, had the race of the day as he ran a personal 
    best of 27:30, 1:20 faster than his xc debut last week. Kevin DiGenova improved 
    by :12 to place 7th on the team and 8th overall. Sam Berberian only improved 
    :09 but ran a much better race. 800 runner, Steve Stoddard, showed he might 
    have a future in cross country as he improved :34 to run 29:07. Jesus Alvarez 
    ran a great race, improving by :15 in running 29:30.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT knows that in order to be considered a serious contender 
    for a national birth, they need to get their delta for men one through five 
    down to under one minute. While it is currently 1:25 it will likely get much 
    worse as Schmeckpeper faces competition if others on the team do not improve 
    an equal amount.</p>
