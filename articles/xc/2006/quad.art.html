  <p><strong><span class="style1">MIT SHOWS STRENGTH IN DOMINATING
    BATES INVITATIONAL</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">September 16, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">For the second Saturday in succession the hot and humid weather
    returned to make the cross country racing miserable.&nbsp; This weekend,
    MIT traveled to the Twinbrook cross country course, home to both Bates College
    and the University of Southern Maine.&nbsp; Joining the fray was Keene State
    College.&nbsp; Not only did the runners have to deal with the weather conditions
    but the course itself is a true cross country course with plenty of hills
    and turns through the woods.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">MIT, running a controlled and patient
    race, dominated both the men's and women's races with impressive second half
    efforts to walk-down the competition.&nbsp; The men out-pointed their opponents
    with 32 points to 65 for USM, 66 for Bates and 69 for Keene State in what
    proved to be a great battle for second place.&nbsp; The women scored an impressive
    25 points, placing seven runners ahead of Bates and Keene State's third runners.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bates
    finished with 49 points to 61 for Keene State. </p>
  <p align="left">In the men's race, Keene State sent three runners out at the
    start, creating a sizeable lead at the half-mile mark.&nbsp; Bates College
    had a large group along with another bunch of Keene State runners just ahead
    of MIT's main pack.&nbsp; Only Jake Ruzevick had chosen to go out with the
    leaders, running in fifth place at that point in the race.</p>
  <p align="left">Between the two mile and three mile marks MIT made a strong
    move to pull even with their opponents and by the fourth mile mark the race
    was over.&nbsp; MIT ended up with six of the top 12 runners, led by Ruzevick
    with a winning time of 26:57.&nbsp; Through six runners MIT boasted a delta
    of :53.&nbsp; Kevin Brulois finished fifth in 27:27, Johannes Schneider in
    27:34, Trevor Rundell in 27:45, Brandon Pung in 27:49 and Joe Roy-Mayhew
    in 27:50.</p>
  <p align="left">The women had not intention of being outdone by the men and
    proceeded to display the same patience early in the race and even more aggressiveness
    after the first mile.&nbsp; Maria Monks grudgingly allowed Evans of Keene
    State to go unopposed but followed the plan for the benefit of the team.&nbsp; Leading
    fellow freshman Jacqui Wentz and Jennifer Doyle past the Keene State and
    Bates pack of runners in mile two, Monks went on to finish second in 19:30.&nbsp; Wentz
    and Doyle finished fourth and fifth respectively in 19:57 and 20:01.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Tech's second pack caught the pack of Bates and Keene State
    runners that could not hang with Monks and company in the early stages of
    the third mile and proceeded to finish hard.&nbsp; Elizabeth Finn returned
    to her usual outstanding racing with a 20:06 for sixth.&nbsp; Hana Adaniya
    finished in eighth in 20:16.&nbsp; Rachel Niehuus back from a brief bout
    with a cold finished in 10th in 20:19 and tri-captain Alisha Schor completed
    the course and top seven runners in 11th in 20:34.&nbsp; The top six runners
    had an impressive delta of :49.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week the top for the women and men travel to Wilmington
    College at the Voice of America course in West Chester, Ohio to race against
    an impressive field at the Division III pre-nationals on Friday at 4:30 for
    the women and 5:15 for the men. </p>
