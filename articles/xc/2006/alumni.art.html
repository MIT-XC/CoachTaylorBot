  <p><strong><span class="style1">ALUMNI/AE MEETS SHOWCASE YOUNG AND OLD IN ANNUAL
        COMPETITION</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">September 2, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">The remnants of Hurricane Ernesto held off long enough to allow
    for excellent running conditions at the annual <a href="alumni.res.html">Alumni/ae
    cross country meets</a>    at Franklin Park.&nbsp; The runners, both current and &quot;Has Been&quot; (a term
    affectionately given to the ex-MIT runners) performed extremely well in the
    first meet of the season.</p>
  <p align="left">The first meet was the women's alumnae meet.&nbsp; The alumnae
    were not able to gather a full team to participate, but those who did, ran
    very well.&nbsp; Martha Buckley led the way for the alumnae as she finished
    eighth in 20:37.&nbsp; Betsy Eames, the most recent alum finished 10th in
    20:53.&nbsp;Jen Gaugler completed the course in 15th, running 23:12 and Fran
    Weld finished in 16th, running 23:49.&nbsp; Meri Silberstein and Alisa Lehman
    showed up for support.</p>
  <p align="left">The varsity displayed their young talent as two freshmen took
    the top two spots.&nbsp; Maria Monks held a five second lead at two miles
    over Jacqui Wentz but when Monks made a wrong turn, Wentz took advantage
    and the victory, 19:43 to 19:57.&nbsp; Despite four top runners not running
    due to injuries or minor pains that may turn into injuries, the varsity took
    the next five places as well.&nbsp; The best part was they were all within
    12 seconds of each other, giving the top seven a delta of :37.&nbsp;Third
    through seventh runners were Rachel Niehuus (20:08), a new-comer to cross
    country, Alisha Schor (20:10), Adrienne Bolger (20:10), Elizabeth Finn (20:11)
    and Jennifer Doyle (20:20).</p>
  <p align="left">Next on the course was the men's race.&nbsp; While the varsity
    squad had plenty of young talent on display with very adequate summer mileage,
    the &quot;Has-Beens&quot;  had equal or better talent, more mileage and more
    experience.&nbsp; Ben Schmeckpeper, Sean Nolan and Fivos Constantinou took
    off across the field at the start and never saw a varsity runner again (unless
    they turned around to look back in the distance).</p>
  <p align="left">Nolan ran a well paced race and overtook a slightly fatiguing
    Schmeckpeper to win easily in 25:25.&nbsp; Constantinou also took advantage
    of Schmeck's fatigue, claiming second place in 25:40.&nbsp; Scmeck finished
    in 25:48 for third and the guaranteed victory due to the 1-2-3 sweep.&nbsp; Jake
    Ruzevick made a gallant effort at breaking up the threesome but due to some
    stomach problems he had to settle for fourth with a 25:56.&nbsp; Kevin Brulois
    rallied late in the race after a dismal second and third mile to finish fifth
    in 26:17.&nbsp; Chris Bruce ran a great race, coming back after missing all
    of 2005 with an injury, finishing sixth in 26:30.</p>
  <p align="left">Eric Khatchadourian ran behind the varsity's second group early
    in the race then moved up to pass the varsity's top freshman in the final
    mile, finishing seventh in 26:42.&nbsp; Brandon Pung, the aforementioned
    freshman, ran a strong race but faded a bit in the final stages, finishing
    eighth in 26:46.&nbsp; Another freshman, Jack Bourbonnais, ran 26:55 to finish
    as the varsity's fifth man.&nbsp; Craig Wildman had to drop out of the race
    due to a pulled hamstring, but ageless Terry McNatt made up for it with a
    strong 27:36 at age 41 as the fifth man for the alumni, giving them the 25
    to 32 victory.</p>
  <p align="left">Other alumni racing were Bob Collins (28:30) at age 45, Eugene
    Tung (28:46) at age 40, Mark Feldmeier (31:12) at age 32, Sumner Brown a
    truly amazing 31:56 at age 62 and James Williams (32:30) at age 38.&nbsp;Helping
    to cheer their team were Yuval Mazor and Chuck Van Buren. </p>
  <p align="left">The varsity were too spread out among the top four, but four
    through eight finished within 16 seconds of each other.&nbsp; Both squads
    will be home next Saturday to defend the Engineer's Cup against RPI and WPI.&nbsp; The
    women race at 1:00 and the men at 1:45.</p>
