  <p><strong><span class="style1">MIT MEN SWEEP FIELD AT MT. HOLYOKE
    INVITATIONAL</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">September 30, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">MIT rested seven of their top eight runners in the men's race
    of the Mt. Holyoke Invitational but the results did not indicate it as Kevin
    Brulois led the sub-varsity to a sweep of the top 10 places with his 26:43
    winning performance.&nbsp; Tech's
    depth was clear as the delta for the 1-10 spread was a mere 1:17.&nbsp; Running
    to second place was Babson College with 61 points, followed closely by Clark
    University with 65 points.&nbsp; Framingham State brought up the rear with
    115 points.</p>
  <p align="left">The course will be the site of the NEWMAC Conference Championship
    so MIT took advantage of the opportunity to race on the course.&nbsp; A fairly
    flat course, the many turns slow it down significantly.</p>
  <p align="left">Running season bests in the meet were Matt Bieniosek (28:49),
    Yermie Cohen (27:19) and Kevin DiGenova (27:58).&nbsp; Running personal bests
    were Ethan Huwe (28:28), Peter Mulligan (29:23), Archi Stuk (27:31) and Sandy
    Spicer who ran a 1:19 personal best.</p>
  <p align="left">The women's team also rested their top seven, but with less
    depth and stiffer competition than the men, they were forced to settle for
    a tie for second with Mt. Holyoke College with 65 points.&nbsp; Winning the
    meet with 23 points was Wellesley College led by freshman Clare Egan running
    19:29 for first place.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">MIT's
    number eight runner, Adrienne Bolger, ran an impressive 19:57 personal best,
    good for third place overall.&nbsp; Racing for the first time this season
    were Erika Erickson (20:24) and Jessie Thompson (20:59).&nbsp; Both are coming
    back from early season injuries and hope to be varsity contributors later
    in the season.&nbsp; Liz Labuz place third for the Engineers with a time
    of 20:57.&nbsp; Becky Idell ran a personal best of 21:22 to finish sixth
  for Tech. </p>
  <p align="left">Next Saturday MIT heads back to Franklin Park for the NEICAAA
    (All New England) Championship.&nbsp; The women's sub-varsity race at noon
    is followed by the varsity race at 12:30.&nbsp; The men's varsity race follows
    the women's races at 1:00 and the schedule is concluded with the men's sub-varsity
    race at 1:45.&nbsp; This
    race will be a good mid-season indication as to how MIT stacks up against
    the top Division III teams in the region.   </p>
