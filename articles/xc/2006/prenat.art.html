    PLACE FINISH AT NATIONAL PREVIEW</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">September 22, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">The weather did everything possible to make what should have
    been a very fast course, a very average one at the National Preview Championship
    hosted by Wilmington College at Voice of America Park in Mason, Ohio.&nbsp; The
    two inches of rain that fell the night before and morning of the championship
    combined with the winds caused many runners to struggle and run perhaps a
    minute slower than they would have on a packed, dry course.</p>
  <p align="left">A group that did not seem to be too affected were the MIT women.&nbsp; Placing
    fourth among 15 teams, five of which were ranked nationally, the women harriers
    took down #19 Allegheny and #22 Wheaton (IL) while losing to #1 Geneseo,
    #2 Washington University of St. Louis and narrowly to #33 Depauw.</p>
  <p align="left">Leading the way for the Engineers was freshman Maria Monks.&nbsp; Monks
    went with the lead pack at the beginning, following the two lead Geneseo
    runners, Elizabeth Montgomery and Shannon Griggs.&nbsp; At the two mile mark
    of the 6K course, Monks had begun to pull away from the chase group, eventually
    leading them to the finish line by five seconds for third place in 22:10.</p>
  <p align="left">Despite having a cold that kept her unsure as to whether she
    would be able to run or not until she had warmed up, fellow freshman Jacqui
    Wentz moved up through the pack after mile one to eventually garner 19th
    place with a remarkable race.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's pack consisting of Elizabeth Finn, Jennifer Doyle and
    Hana Adaniya placed 27th, 29th and 30th in the 181 runner field, moved up
    well throughout the last two and three quarter miles, finishing only seven
    seconds apart.&nbsp; Close
    behind was Rachel Niehuus (37th) and Alisha Schor (60th).   </p>
  <p align="left">Running at this level is a first for MIT women's cross country
    and the team hopes it is only a hint of things to come.</p>
  <p align="left">The men's contingent did not have quite as good a result.&nbsp; Getting
    out in the back of the pack and unable to move up on the soft, wet course,
    the Engineers finished 11th out of 16 teams for their worst outing of the
    young season.&nbsp; Despite number two man, Kevin Brulois not racing due
    to academic conflicts, the harriers expected to do much better.</p>
  <p align="left">Jake Ruzevick led MIT with a 37th place finish in 26:33 on
    the 8K course.&nbsp; Although Tech had a tight delta of 33 seconds through
    four runners, the next man was 22 places back.&nbsp; Joe Roy-Mayhew ran second
    for MIT for the first time with a 26:52 for 51st place.&nbsp; Close behind
    was Trevor Rundell in 57th, running 26:58.&nbsp; Freshman Johannes Schneider
    ran a solid race, finishing 69th in 27:06.&nbsp; Freshman Jack Bourbonnais
    rounded out MIT's scoring with a 27:29 in 91st place. </p>
  <p align="left">The men need to run with more hunger and greater passion if
    they hope to reach their potential this season.</p>
  <p align="left">Both teams travel to the Mt. Holyoke Invitational next&nbsp; Saturday
    with the men running at 11:00 and the women at 12:00.&nbsp; Those racing
    at Pre-nationals will be taking the weekend off at Mt. Holyoke giving the
    second units the opportunity to win the race.</p>
