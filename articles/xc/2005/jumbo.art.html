  <p align="left"> Fivos Constantinou, not showing his potential during his first 
    three years of cross country at MIT, has entered his senior season determined 
    to show what he is capable of. On Saturday he reaffirmed that he is the number 
    one MIT runner for 2005 and he did so on the very hilly and challenging course 
    on Tufts University at the Grafton facility. In running to an outstanding 
    fifth place finish in 25:58, Constantinou led the MIT Engineers to a third 
    place finish among seven of the better teams in New England. MIT defeated 
    two of the top ten Division III teams (Bates and Amherst) as well as Division 
    II, Bentley College. The third and fourth ranked teams, Wesleyan and Tufts 
    defeated MIT with Tufts claiming the victory.</p>
  <p align="left">Bentley and Wesleyan went out pretty hard at the start with 
    Ray Agnew, the eventual winner from Bentley, leading the way at 5:04. MIT 
    showed respect for the course, going out in 5:26 as Constantinou and Kevin 
    Brulois came through in about 20th place. The rest of MIT's top five were 
    back between 30th and 40th position.</p>
  <p align="left">By the halfway point Constantinou and Brulois were in 8th and 
    9th respectively, while Eric Khatchdourian had moved up to 20th and Jake Ruzevick 
    was still in 30th position. Spencer Dudley had moved up slightly to 34th and 
    Erik Stafl to 37th. MIT had moved ahead of Bates but Amherst still had five 
    runners in front of Ruzevick.</p>
  <p align="left">At the finish, Constantinou had moved up the fifth and Khatchadourian 
    had passed Brulois, finishing in 10th place. Brulois managed to hold on to 
    12th place and Ruzevick moved up well in the final mile, passing two Amherst 
    runners to finish 23rd. Stafl passed Dudley in the final mile to place 32nd 
    to bring MIT within 11 points of Wesleyan whose fourth and fifth men faded 
    a bit at the end.</p>
  <p align="left">This was the first meet since the opening Alumni Meet that MIT 
    ran all of their top four runners. MIT's fifth man, freshman Trevor Rundell, 
    remains out with an IT band injury. The team anxiously awaits his return. 
    The current spread between first and fifth runners is 1:14, too much to defeat 
    any of the top teams.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week MIT will take a weekend off from racing. The following 
    Saturday the team will compete in the All Division New England Championship 
    at Franklin Park.</p>
