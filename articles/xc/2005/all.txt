        INVITATIONAL**
    
    
      
    
    October 15, 2005
    
    
      
    
    The course was altered due to construction, adding approximately 
        two miles of pavement and concrete to the course. A week of rain had what 
        was not concrete, muddy or underwater. Wearing spikes would hurt you on the 
        hard surfaces but wearing flats assured little to no traction in the mud and 
        water. MIT made the decision to go with no spikes, raced much better than 
        they did a week ago, and the results showed it. Without top man Fivos Constantinou, 
        the Tech varsity secured seventh place in the 27 team field at the University 
        of Albany Invitational with superb races from Eric Khatchadourian (11th), 
        Jake Ruzevick (17th) and Kevin Brulois (20th), all running personal bests 
        on the challenging course. If Constantinou had been racing MIT would have 
        challenged for second place in the predominantly Division I field.
    
    
      
    
    Many MIT runners performed well, but the Engineers are still 
        in need of a fifth man. Trevor Rundell, who returned from injury to race well 
        last week, was not able to handle the fast early pace and fell back after 
        two miles. The top four runners are capable of running within seconds of each 
        other and if Rundell races well the total delta for the top five can be within 
        45 seconds. Erik Stafl has been making a move to join the top five but is 
        still over a minute back.
    
    
      
    
    In the Sub-varsity race MIT placed sixth out of 13 teams. In 
        this race MIT did not have any front runners, being led by Joe Roy-Mayhew 
        in 23rd place at 27:01, but the delta for the top seven was 47 seconds.
    
    
      
    
    MIT takes next weekend off from racing in preparation for the 
        NEWMAC Conference Championship on the Smith College course. MIT has never 
        lost the championship. Even though this is a rebuilding year and MIT's weakest 
        in some time, the Engineers still hope to continue their streak. Their closest 
        competitor, Coast Guard, always races well in the championship and surely 
        has their sights on dethroning MIT.

    **VARSITY DEFEAT ALUMNI IN 100TH ANNIVERSARY MEET**
    
    
      
    
    September 3, 2005
    
    
      
    
    2005 marks the 100th anniversary of cross country at MIT. In 
        honor of the event, many alumni came back to Cambridge to celebrate and take 
        part in the annual 
        race against the varsity. Ben Schmeckpeper, one season removed from his 
        varsity days, easily handled the varsity runners, winning by nine seconds 
        with a time of 25:56 on a 80 degree, sunny day at Franklin Park. The alumni, 
        even up with the varsity through two runners, put their three, four, five 
        runners in just after the varsity's, resulting in a 23 to 32 loss.
    
    
      
    
    At the start of the race there was no doubt the alumni were 
        in this race for the win. Schmeckpeper and Dan Feldman took the lead and pushed 
        the pace through a 4:54 first mile. Terry McNatt followed the varsity's second 
        group and a large group of alums, including Chris Fidkowski, Jesse Darly, 
        Eugene Tung, Carlos Renjifo and Bob Collins closely followed. At mile one 
        the alumni had eight runners in front of the varsity's seventh man.
    
    
      
    
    At mile two, Schmeckpeper and Feldman maintained their lead. 
        The varsity still held the next five places but McNatt had fallen off the 
        pace a little. Renjifo and Fidkowski had separated themselves from the rest 
        of the varsity to set the stage for the rest of the race. If Schmeckpeper 
        and Feldman could hold off Fivos Constantinou and Kevin Brulois then the three 
        alums would need to move up and break up the varsity threesome of Eric Khatchadourian, 
        Jake Ruzevick and Trevor Rundell.
    
    
      
    
    By mile three, Feldman was falling back from Schmeckpeper and 
        Constantinou and Brulois were only three seconds behind. The alumni threesome 
        were now 14 seconds behind the varsity trio. The alumni were banking on the 
        fact that the varsity's fourth and fifth runners were both freshmen and may 
        crack in their inaugural 8K race.
    
    
      
    
    At mile four, Feldman had fallen to fourth but the freshmen 
        fell away from Khatchadourian and Fidkowski and Renjifo had closed to within 
        eight seconds of Rundell and 14 seconds behind Ruzevick. Throughout the last 
        mile Fidkowski closed the gap but ended up five seconds behind Ruzevick and 
        two seconds behind Rundell. Renjifo could not close and McNatt showed a lot 
        of game keeping Kevin DiGenova of the varsity from catching him in the final 
        straight.
    
    
      
    
    Using the age graded tables, 
        the Alumni were able to squeeze out a 26-29 victory. Sumner Brown '66, moved 
        up from 42nd to 5th place and Terry McNatt '87, moved up from 10th to 6th 
        to push Khatchadourian back to seventh and give the "Has Beens" 
        a well earned victory.

    September 24, 2005
    
    
      
    
     Fivos Constantinou, not showing his potential during his first 
        three years of cross country at MIT, has entered his senior season determined 
        to show what he is capable of. On Saturday he reaffirmed that he is the number 
        one MIT runner for 2005 and he did so on the very hilly and challenging course 
        on Tufts University at the Grafton facility. In running to an outstanding 
        fifth place finish in 25:58, Constantinou led the MIT Engineers to a third 
        place finish among seven of the better teams in New England. MIT defeated 
        two of the top ten Division III teams (Bates and Amherst) as well as Division 
        II, Bentley College. The third and fourth ranked teams, Wesleyan and Tufts 
        defeated MIT with Tufts claiming the victory.
    
    
      
    
    Bentley and Wesleyan went out pretty hard at the start with 
        Ray Agnew, the eventual winner from Bentley, leading the way at 5:04. MIT 
        showed respect for the course, going out in 5:26 as Constantinou and Kevin 
        Brulois came through in about 20th place. The rest of MIT's top five were 
        back between 30th and 40th position.
    
    
      
    
    By the halfway point Constantinou and Brulois were in 8th and 
        9th respectively, while Eric Khatchdourian had moved up to 20th and Jake Ruzevick 
        was still in 30th position. Spencer Dudley had moved up slightly to 34th and 
        Erik Stafl to 37th. MIT had moved ahead of Bates but Amherst still had five 
        runners in front of Ruzevick.
    
    
      
    
    At the finish, Constantinou had moved up the fifth and Khatchadourian 
        had passed Brulois, finishing in 10th place. Brulois managed to hold on to 
        12th place and Ruzevick moved up well in the final mile, passing two Amherst 
        runners to finish 23rd. Stafl passed Dudley in the final mile to place 32nd 
        to bring MIT within 11 points of Wesleyan whose fourth and fifth men faded 
        a bit at the end.
    
    
      
    
    This was the first meet since the opening Alumni Meet that MIT 
        ran all of their top four runners. MIT's fifth man, freshman Trevor Rundell, 
        remains out with an IT band injury. The team anxiously awaits his return. 
        The current spread between first and fifth runners is 1:14, too much to defeat 
        any of the top teams.
    
    
      
    
    Next week MIT will take a weekend off from racing. The following 
        Saturday the team will compete in the All Division New England Championship 
        at Franklin Park.

    **Engineers Place Sixth at NCAA Division III Regional 
        Qualifier**
    
    
      
    
    November 12, 2005
    
    
      
    
    Seeded sixth going into the NCAA 
        Division III Regional Qualifier hosted by Springfield College at the Veteran's 
        Golf Course, MIT ran true to their ranking, but did it in a most unexpected 
        way. Tufts University defended their title and number one seed by finishing 
        with a low score total of 62 points. Running a very inspired race, Wesleyan 
        University surprised some people by finishing second, just ahead of Keene 
        State and Williams with 118 points to 132 and 139 respectively. The top three 
        teams move on to the NCAA Championships being held next weekend at Ohio Wesleyan 
        University.
    
    
      
    
    Veteran's Golf Course presented a constantly rolling, winding 
        course for the 49 teams entered in the race. Overall, the course had no large 
        hills so the thought of most runners was to get out pretty hard, particularly 
        with the relatively narrow starting area, which only allowed each team to 
        put two members on the front line. MIT followed that thought process and did 
        get out relatively hard, moving their way up towards the front by the half 
        mile mark.
    
    
      
    
    At the mile mark, captains Fivos Constantinou '06 and Eric Khatchadourian 
        '06, looked to be taking care of business as they have all season as both 
        were among the top ten runners. Kevin Brulois '07, who stopped for a couple 
        of seconds to put his shoe back on, and Jake Ruzevick '09 were also up close, 
        running in the top 20. By the two mile mark there was some concern as both 
        Constantinou and Khatchadourian, while running a fast second mile split, had 
        fallen off the lead pack and looked to be having some difficulty although 
        they were still in the top 20. Brulois and Ruzevick seemed comfortable and 
        were maintaining their position in the top 30. Trevor Rundell '09, who had 
        gone out with Spencer Dudley '07 and Erik Stafl '08, was moving up in the 
        crowd, running the same split as Brulois.
    
    
      
    
    The third mile seemed to be marked a little long because everyone 
        seemed to run a slower split but did not seem to be slowing down. Constantinou 
        and Khatchadourian however were slowing down, losing more than ten seconds 
        to Brulois and falling back past 40th place. Ruzevick was running aggressively, 
        staying in the top 30. Rundell continued to move up, now just a few seconds 
        behind Constantinou.
    
    
      
    
    Typically in a relatively flat 8k race their is little change 
        in the places in the race after three and a half miles. The fourth mile was 
        crucial to MIT to see if Constantinou and Khatchadourian could hold on to 
        their current position and if Rundell could continue to move up. Brulois moved 
        up slightly to 24th position and Ruzevick ran just as hard. Rundell ran just 
        a couple of seconds off their pace, moving just past Constantinou who seemed 
        to recover a little bit. Khatchadourian faded back to around 60th position, 
        11 seconds behind Rundell and Constantinou.
    
    
      
    
    At the finish Brulois sprinted home in 22nd place, eight places 
        and :17 away from making nationals on an individual basis. Ruzevick ran a 
        great race as a freshman, finishing in 27th position. The race of the day 
        had to be by Rundell, running a personal best time of 26:35 and placing 40th. 
        Constantinou lost a little time but only two places, finishing in 43rd place. 
        Khatchadourian recovered a little in the final mile, moving up to 54th position 
        to give MIT a total of 186 points, six points behind fifth place Bowdoin College, 
        but four points ahead of Connecticut College and six ahead of Middlebury College.
    
    
      
    
    For the first time since 2000 MIT will not be sending anyone 
        to the NCAA Championship. The team will lose the services of Constantinou 
        and Khatchadourian due to graduation but should regain the services of Chris 
        Bruce and Chris Wong, two sophomores who had run very well as freshmen.

    October 8, 2005
    
    
      
    
    An MIT team with the opportunity to show they belonged among 
        the top five Division III teams in New England and among the top 10 of all 
        schools in the region failed to seize the moment, placing 17th among the 47 
        teams with a score of 441. The rain and muddy conditions made the going a 
        little slow for everyone but MIT seemed to slow more than others in the final 
        two miles of the race, losing perhaps as many as six team places.
    
    
      
    
    Going into the competition, the worry was not MIT's top four 
        runners but the gap between the fourth and fifth runners that had plagued 
        them throughout the early season. Led by Fivos Constantinou, Eric Khatchadourian, 
        Kevin Brulois and Jake Ruzevick were planning on placing among the top 50 
        runners by running a smart, well-paced race. If either Erik Stafl, Spencer 
        Dudley or Kevin DiGenova could place in the top 100 MIT would have a good 
        score.
    
    
      
    
     While the first group led by Constantinou were pretty much 
        on pace through the first two miles, the second group led by Stafl fell off 
        the pace significantly in the second mile. In the third mile all the MIT runners 
        fell off the pace a bit, but still managed to stay in good position. However, 
        the good position ended there. In the fourth mile Constantinou was the only 
        one of the seven to stay competitive. Constantinou hung tough through the 
        end of the race, despite a cold he had battled earlier in the week. His time 
        of 26:01 to give him 38th place were time and place personal bests. The other 
        Engineers finished with a good last mile but it was too little, too late. 
        Overall, MIT finished seventh among Division III teams, a little further back 
        than expected.
    
    
      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, MIT had similar results. One bright 
        spot was delivered by Trevor Rundell. The freshman had missed the past three 
        weeks due to an I-T band injury, but came back as if he had not missed a day, 
        placing 21st in the race, and fifth on the team when combining both races. 
        Former standout, Steve Maltas had a good race in his comeback season with 
        a 28:09 finish and a well paced race.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT travels to Albany, NY to race in the Albany State 
        Invitational. The unfamiliar teams and course should provide a refreshing 
        atmosphere and hopefully lead to a better race.

    **MIT RACES TO 8TH CONSECUTIVE NEWMAC CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    October 29, 2005
    
    
      
    
    MIT successfully defended their NEWMAC 
        Cross Country title yesterday at the challenging Smith College course in Northampton, 
        MA. Led by senior Eric Khatchadourian the MIT harriers placed 2, 3, 5, 6, 
        9 to total 25 points to runner-up Coast Guard's 33 points. The two perennial 
        rivals were followed by Springfield with 73, WPI with 140, Clark at 163, Babson 
        close behind at 166 and Wheaton closing out the scoring with 168 points.
    
    
      
    
    The hilly course offers everything a challenging cross country 
        course should offer; change of terrain, sharp turns, quick transition from 
        uphill to downhill and at times, tricky footing. Although the weather called 
        for rain mixed with snow, the runners toed the line with sun mixed with some 
        clouds and the temperature in the low 40s.
    
    
      
    
    Due to the difficulty of the course, the MIT plan was to run 
        a conservative first mile, stay behind Coast Guard, work up to Coast Guard 
        over the next mile and a half and then move hard in the second half of the 
        race. The only problem with this was that the normally aggressive Coast Guard 
        runners had the same plan. MIT proved the more disciplined in this effort 
        although with Coast Guard also running a conservative first mile the plan 
        to move in the latter stages of the race proved less effective.
    
    
      
    
    Khatchadourian, Kevin Brulois '07, Fivos Constantinou '06, Jake 
        Ruzevick '09 and Spencer Dudley '07 trailed the top five Coast Guard runners 
        by a couple of seconds at the mile mark. Springfield College, running a surprisingly 
        aggressive first mile, was in the lead with their entire top seven. By mile 
        two, Mike Flint of Coast Guard had opened up a 13 second lead. Khatchadourian 
        was leading the MIT charge, who were content to run the plan. The other Coast 
        Guard runners could not go with Flint and had strung out a bit, but overall 
        were still leading the race. Springfield now only had three runners in the 
        mix.
    
    
      
    
    By mile four, Khatchadourian had broken away from Brulois by 
        five seconds and had closed the gap to Flint to four seconds. Constantinou 
        and Ruzevick were 10 seconds behind Khatchadourian along with a Coast Guard 
        runner. Another Coastie was right behind them. Dudley had fallen off the pace 
        a bit, :18 behind his teammates with two Coast Guard runners within five seconds 
        of him. The race was in hand but not over.
    
    
      
    
    Working hard over the final mile, Khatchadourian was not quite 
        able to catch Flint, losing by eight seconds in 26:08. Brulois held on for 
        third in 26:21 but Laurel of Coast Guard outkicked Constantinou (26:27) and 
        Ruzevick (26:31) for fourth. Yandell from Coast Guard maintained seventh place 
        and after Hepper from Springfield, Dudley held off the Persun and Newton of 
        Coast Guard in 26:55 to secure the team victory. Just one second behind Newton 
        was freshman Trevor Rundell (26:59), continuing to improve after his mid-season 
        injury. Also joining his teammates on the all-conference squad was Joe Roy-Mayhew 
        '08, in 13th place, just four seconds behind Rundell in 27:03.
    
    
      
    
    In two weeks the Engineers travel to Springfield College for 
        the NCAA Division III Regional Qualifying Meet at Veteran's Golf Course on 
        November 12 at noon. The top three teams and next seven individuals will advance 
        to the NCAA Division III Championship at Ohio Wesleyan University. MIT, ranked 
        8th in the region, will do well to improve on that mark. Individually, any 
        of MIT's top four could have a big day and advance though it will probably 
        take a finish in the top 15-20 overall to make the trip to Ohio.

    **1-2-3 Finish Leads The Way to Engineer's Cup**

    MIT traveled to Northampton, Massachusetts to race in the Smith 
        College Invitational. Typically the weekend for the annual Engineer's 
        Cup between MIT, RPI and WPI, the two NEWMAC Conference Schools, MIT and WPI 
        wanted to run the Engineer's Cup within the Smith College Invite since this 
        would be the only opportunity to race on the conference championship course. 
        RPI agreed and the meet was on.
    
    
      
    
    MIT went out conservatively on the very hilly course, preferring 
        to save a little for the latter stages of the race. Despite the slow pace 
        set by Kevin Brulois of MIT, no one seemed willing to go faster. At the mile 
        mark, Brulois was leading in 5:34. Teammates Eric Khatchadourian and Trevor 
        Rundell were right behind Brulois but so was everyone else.
    
    
      
    
    By the two mile mark, even though the MIT threesome maintained 
        the same pace as the first mile, everyone else fell off, giving the trio a 
        five second lead. Another group of three from MIT, Kevin DiGenova, Yermie 
        Cohen and Spencer Dudley were about 13 seconds behind their teammates but 
        moving up on the rest of the field. The last two MIT groups had merged and 
        were approximately 30 seconds behind the second group of MIT runners.
    
    
      
    
    At the end of the third mile, Brulois, Khatchadourian and Rundell 
        had all but sealed the race. DiGenova and Cohen had moved up to the top 15 
        and were still running strong. The last two groups, led by Nate Sharpe, were 
        passing people en masse. MIT continued to move up through the mostly flat 
        fourth mile, putting a lot of distance between themselves and the other teams.
    
    
      
    
    The fifth and final mile, a pretty hilly mile, particularly 
        so for the runners who went out fast in the first mile, was a chance for MIT 
        to move up and dominate the meet. Brulois won the meet handily in 27:08. Khatchadourian 
        finished second in 27:21 and was followed by Rundell in third in 27:33. Three 
        RPI runners were next to the finish line, just ahead of DiGenova in seventh. 
        Cohen finished in ninth to give MIT a 22 point victory over 40 for second 
        place RPI. Sharpe had a tremendous race, finishing 16th overall in 28:44, 
        nearly negative splitting the entire race.
    
    
      
    
    MIT held out three of their top seven runners with a fourth 
        missing the race due to injury. Next week the Engineers travel to UMass Dartmouth 
        to test their skills on a flat course.

    **CONSTANTINOU LEADS ENGINEERS IN UMASS DARTMOUTH INVITATIONAL**

    The course was relatively slow due to part of the course being 
        soggy from all the rain the day before, but the competition was anything but 
        slow at the UMass Dartmouth Invitational. Fivos 
        Constantinou continued to show that he has added cross country success to 
        his resume as he led MIT to an eighth place finish in the 33 team field. Constantinou 
        ran 25:35 for a personal best, finishing 13th overall and seventh among collegiate 
        athletes.
    
    
      
    
    MIT held out three of their top five runners, Kevin Brulois 
        and Eric Khatchadourian, in order not to over race them and Trevor Rundell, 
        who is nursing a minor injury. Despite the loss of top finishers, the Engineers, 
        ran and competed well. Nearly everyone on the team ran a controlled, well 
        paced race and as a result, many ran personal best times despite the wet conditions.
    
    
      
    
    Freshman, Jake Ruzevick, ran a very good race, running with 
        Constantinou through 2 1/2 miles before falling back. Nevertheless, Ruzevick 
        placed 19th overall and was the top freshman among the collegiate runners 
        with a time of 25:53.
    
    
      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, Brian Jacokes ran an outstanding race. 
        Jacokes placed fifth after moving up in the field throughout the first three 
        miles. Jacokes was followed by teammates Steve Nicholson in eighth, Tyler 
        Abrams in ninth, Rocco Repetski in 18th and Matt Bieniosek in 19th to earn 
        second place as a team among the 15 teams competing in this race.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT will run everyone healthy enough to do so at 
        the Jumbo Invitational hosted by Tufts University at their Grafton, Massachusetts 
        course. The men's race will start at 1:00.
