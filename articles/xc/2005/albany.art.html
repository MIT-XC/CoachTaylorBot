  <p><strong><font size="+3">HARRIERS REDEEM THEMSELVES WITH GOOD RACE AT ALBANY 
    INVITATIONAL</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">October 15, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">The course was altered due to construction, adding approximately 
    two miles of pavement and concrete to the course. A week of rain had what 
    was not concrete, muddy or underwater. Wearing spikes would hurt you on the 
    hard surfaces but wearing flats assured little to no traction in the mud and 
    water. MIT made the decision to go with no spikes, raced much better than 
    they did a week ago, and the results showed it. Without top man Fivos Constantinou, 
    the Tech varsity secured seventh place in the 27 team field at the <a href="albany.res.html">University 
    of Albany Invitational</a> with superb races from Eric Khatchadourian (11th), 
    Jake Ruzevick (17th) and Kevin Brulois (20th), all running personal bests 
    on the challenging course. If Constantinou had been racing MIT would have 
    challenged for second place in the predominantly Division I field.</p>
  <p align="left">Many MIT runners performed well, but the Engineers are still 
    in need of a fifth man. Trevor Rundell, who returned from injury to race well 
    last week, was not able to handle the fast early pace and fell back after 
    two miles. The top four runners are capable of running within seconds of each 
    other and if Rundell races well the total delta for the top five can be within 
    45 seconds. Erik Stafl has been making a move to join the top five but is 
    still over a minute back.</p>
  <p align="left">In the Sub-varsity race MIT placed sixth out of 13 teams. In 
    this race MIT did not have any front runners, being led by Joe Roy-Mayhew 
    in 23rd place at 27:01, but the delta for the top seven was 47 seconds.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT takes next weekend off from racing in preparation for the 
    NEWMAC Conference Championship on the Smith College course. MIT has never 
    lost the championship. Even though this is a rebuilding year and MIT's weakest 
    in some time, the Engineers still hope to continue their streak. Their closest 
    competitor, Coast Guard, always races well in the championship and surely 
    has their sights on dethroning MIT.</p>
