  <p><strong><font size="+3">1-2-3 Finish Leads The Way to Engineer's Cup</font></strong></p>

  <p align="left">MIT traveled to Northampton, Massachusetts to race in the <a href="smith.res.html">Smith 
    College Invitational</a>. Typically the weekend for the annual Engineer's 
    Cup between MIT, RPI and WPI, the two NEWMAC Conference Schools, MIT and WPI 
    wanted to run the Engineer's Cup within the Smith College Invite since this 
    would be the only opportunity to race on the conference championship course. 
    RPI agreed and the meet was on.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT went out conservatively on the very hilly course, preferring 
    to save a little for the latter stages of the race. Despite the slow pace 
    set by Kevin Brulois of MIT, no one seemed willing to go faster. At the mile 
    mark, Brulois was leading in 5:34. Teammates Eric Khatchadourian and Trevor 
    Rundell were right behind Brulois but so was everyone else.</p>
  <p align="left">By the two mile mark, even though the MIT threesome maintained 
    the same pace as the first mile, everyone else fell off, giving the trio a 
    five second lead. Another group of three from MIT, Kevin DiGenova, Yermie 
    Cohen and Spencer Dudley were about 13 seconds behind their teammates but 
    moving up on the rest of the field. The last two MIT groups had merged and 
    were approximately 30 seconds behind the second group of MIT runners.</p>
  <p align="left">At the end of the third mile, Brulois, Khatchadourian and Rundell 
    had all but sealed the race. DiGenova and Cohen had moved up to the top 15 
    and were still running strong. The last two groups, led by Nate Sharpe, were 
    passing people en masse. MIT continued to move up through the mostly flat 
    fourth mile, putting a lot of distance between themselves and the other teams.</p>
  <p align="left">The fifth and final mile, a pretty hilly mile, particularly 
    so for the runners who went out fast in the first mile, was a chance for MIT 
    to move up and dominate the meet. Brulois won the meet handily in 27:08. Khatchadourian 
    finished second in 27:21 and was followed by Rundell in third in 27:33. Three 
    RPI runners were next to the finish line, just ahead of DiGenova in seventh. 
    Cohen finished in ninth to give MIT a 22 point victory over 40 for second 
    place RPI. Sharpe had a tremendous race, finishing 16th overall in 28:44, 
    nearly negative splitting the entire race.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT held out three of their top seven runners with a fourth 
    missing the race due to injury. Next week the Engineers travel to UMass Dartmouth 
    to test their skills on a flat course.</p>
