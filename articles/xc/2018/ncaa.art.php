              <h3>Women Reach Podium With Third Place Finish</h3>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h4>Men Beat Seed, Finish 16th at NCAA DIII Championship</h4>
          </div>
            <p>November 17, 2018</p>
            <p>The MIT Cross Country teams continued their theme of next person up this weekend at the NCAA Division III Cross Country championship, hosted by the University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh&nbsp;at the Lake Breeze Golf Course in Winneconne, WI.&nbsp; The women, seeded fourth and riding a streak of nine straight years of top six finishes at this championship,&nbsp;had a number of individuals perform at an exceptional level to finish&nbsp;third among the 32 teams competing.&nbsp;The men overcame tremendous losses going into and during the season to move up from their seed of 20th in the country to finish 16th.</p>
            <p>The course at Lake Breeze, which was destroyed at the Pre-National meet in mid-October, had not totally recovered by race time.&nbsp; Allowing athletes to get on the course on Thursday did further damage, so the course was shut down until race time.&nbsp; The sub 30 temperatures kept the course from becoming too muddy and the snow bypassed the area to make for an outstanding race.</p>
            <p>Going into the season it was not clear the women would even reach the national championship, much less place third.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leandra Zimmermann '19 was a returning All American in cross country, but had not run track the past year, so her conditioning was in question.&nbsp; Katie Bacher '20 was injured from the outdoor season and taking a long time to return to action, still not running at all when the season started.&nbsp; Katie Collins '21 had dropped out of the 2017 NCAA Division III Championship and was still not in a good place to be counted on.&nbsp; Marissa McPhillips '20 had suffered through a number of collapses in cross country races and it was not predictable when it might happen again.&nbsp; Jenna Melanson '20, an&nbsp;All America steeplechaser had not produced in cross country in the past, but would need to this year.&nbsp; There were three freshmen who had okay high school performances, but nothing outstanding.&nbsp; Long story short, the odds were not in the Engineer's favor.</p>
            <p>The <a href="2018NCAAwomenresults.pdf">women's race</a> was first at 11:15.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;Engineers adopted a great attitude of &quot;let's just see what we can do&quot;, embracing the challenge instead of fearing it.&nbsp; Izzi Gengaro '22, MIT's number one runner for most of the season, who had missed the last three weeks due to an injury, would be racing, but no one knew how she would perform.&nbsp; At the start, MIT was in box #2, on the same side as the first turn about 300 meters into the course, meaning the Engineers had to get out or get squeezed out at the turn.&nbsp; Zimmermann  got out well for MIT, as did Einat Gavish '22, although she worked too hard to get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;The others did not get out so well, but well enough to move up in the field.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>At the mile mark Zimmermann was in 17th place in 5:39 and Gavish was in 36th place in 5:46.&nbsp; Melanson, Gengaro  and McPhillips  were all out between 60th-100th place in 5:51-5:54.&nbsp; Collins  and Bacher  were much further back, close to 200 in 6:00.&nbsp;&nbsp;MIT continued to move up as the race progressed.&nbsp; At the two mile mark Zimmermann was 12th, Melanson 45th and Gengaro around 65th.&nbsp; Gavish had lost a lot of ground, falling back to ~70th, but Collins was all the way up to the top 100 along with McPhillips&nbsp;with Bacher only a couple seconds behind.</p>
            <p>At the three mile Zimmermann was hanging on in 14th place, but it was obvious she was fatigued.&nbsp; Gengaro moved up slightly to 62nd, Melanson fell back to 66th, Collins was now up to 76th and Bacher was up to 107th and Gavish right with her.&nbsp; In the final .73 we lost a bit, but it was not significant to the team places.&nbsp; Zimmermann earned her second All America award with her 17th place finish in 21:34.&nbsp; Gengaro moved up well to 54th in 22:12.&nbsp; Collins continued to move up, finishing 72nd in 22:22.&nbsp; Melanson hung on&nbsp;to finish fourth for MIT in 89th place in 22:28.&nbsp; Bacher closed out our scoring in 103rd in 22:34&nbsp;for a 1:00 gap for one through five.&nbsp; Favored Johns Hopkins lost to Wash U by one point, 98 to 99.&nbsp; We finished third with 247 points after the individual scorers were taken out, and UW Eau&nbsp;Claire was fourth with 265 points.</p>
            <p>All through the season when someone would have a bad day, someone else would step-up.&nbsp; Zimmermann was a rock all season.&nbsp; Gengaro put her doubts aside and raced extremely well.&nbsp; Collins put her mental game together and delivered when it counted in the championship season.&nbsp; Melanson had a bad day for her, but she hung tough to allow Tech to get on the podium.&nbsp; Bacher fought through her rehab and much shortened season to step-up when her team needed it.&nbsp; Job&nbsp;well done by the Engineers!</p>
            <p>The men's team at MIT had suffered numerous losses going into and during the season.&nbsp; The loss of two-time All American Dennis Maloney '19 to a pre-graduate start up company&nbsp;hurt a lot.&nbsp; The loss of two key top five freshmen early in season; Zach Johnson and Matthew Kearney dealt a big blow to the Engineers just as it lookd as though they may have a stellar team.&nbsp; Fortunately, just as it looked as though they would not have a solid four or five runner, Josh Derrick '20, Aidan Gilson '19 and Alex Knapp '19 stepped up&nbsp;enough&nbsp;to get the team to nationals.</p>
            <p>The <a href="2018NCAAmenresults.pdf">men's race</a> did not start the way MIT had hoped.&nbsp; There was a recall start due to two MIT runners (Josh Derrick '20 and Ryan Wilson '22) going down shortly after the start.&nbsp; In the second start&nbsp;Andrew Mah '22 got out well, as did Aidan Gilson '19 and Billy Woltz '20, but the rest of the Engineers were very far back&nbsp;with Josh Rosenkranz '19, Alex Knapp, Derrick and Wilson back in the mid to upper 200's.&nbsp; At the mile mark Mah was out great in 33rd place at a conservative 4:57.&nbsp; Woltz was close behind in 42nd, Rosenkranz in the mid-80's, Knapp was back in about 135th and Gilson was in the 150's.&nbsp; Derrick and Wilson were out of it in the back.</p>
            <p>At the two mile mark Mah had moved up to 25th and Rosenkranz to 78th, However, Woltz fell back to 98th.&nbsp; Knapp was pretty constant in the mid 130's&nbsp;and Gilson had moved up&nbsp;a few spots.&nbsp; However, by the end of 8K the team gave away the spots for which they fought so hard.&nbsp; Mah finished in 66th in 25:21, Rosenkranz 112th in 20:32, Knapp was 148th in 20:46, Gilson placed 157th in 20:51 and Woltz finished 164th&nbsp;in 20:56.&nbsp; The 35 second delta was impressive, but too far back to be very high up in the team places.&nbsp;Placing 16th with 465 points was a success.</p>
            <p>Overall, the team performed well.&nbsp; While Woltz had been the number one runner in the middle of the season, Mah stepped up when Woltz fell off.&nbsp; Knapp and Gilson performed well as did Rosenkranz, giving the three seniors much of the credit for the Engineer's success.</p>
            <p>Next year, the women will have lost their number one runner, but should be quite strong with three seniors and a lot of national championship experience.&nbsp; The men will graduate three from this class, but with one exceptional freshman class in place and hopefully one more on the way, the future looks much brighter going into 2019 than it did going into 2018.</p>
