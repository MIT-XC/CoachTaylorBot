    #### Varsity Outruns Alumni in Annual Meet
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    September 1, 2018
    
    
                
    
    On a Fall day with near perfect September weather (75 degrees, dry, partly sunny) at the Larz Anderson Park in Brookline, MA, the varsity squads for both the men and women were able to sweep the game, but less than fully fit alums in the annual Alumni/ae Meet on the hilly, 2.76 mile course.
    
    
                
    
    The men were first to race.  Nicholas Waltman '18 led the pack across the field initially, but the varsity soon took over.  The figure eight course provided some intense hills on the second half of the loop.  The varsity runners showed their skills at hill running as they opened up a large gap on the first downhill.
    
    
                
    
    At the mile mark, which the top runners crossed at 5:14, the varsity held the top four spots with Billy Woltz '20 in the lead followed closely by Andrew Mah '22, Josh Rosenkranz '19 and Aidan Gilson '19.  The alums were still in the race as David Walter '18 and Matt Deyo '16 were within five seconds and Justin Bullock '14 and Alex Knoedler '18 were sitting just off the very talented freshman group of Nassim Oufattole, Zach Johnson, Matthew Kearney, Nicky Medearis and Ryan Wilson.
    
    
                
    
    The varsity runners took over in the second mile.  Mah continued to rule the downhills, but Rosenkranz was catching back up on the flat and uphills, both coming through in 10:16.  Woltz fell back by five seconds and Gilson, feeling the effects of a cold, fell off badly.  The freshmen moved up well, not closing ground on the leaders, but passing the alumni to claim the top seven positions with a 15 second delta.  Walter, Deyo, Knoedler and Bullock were still within 10 seconds of the seventh varsity runner.
    
    
                
    
    In the final short loop there was little change.  Mah broke the course record of 14:36 by one second to claim a three second victory over Rosenkranz.  Woltz took third, Johnson fourth and Kearney fifth for an 11 second delta through five runners.
    
    
                
    
    Walter continued to lead the way for the alumni, running 15:05.  Deyo ran 15:06, Bullock 15:18 and Knoedler 15:19.  Colin Godwin '17 was the fifth runner for the alums, finishing in 15:37.  Other alumni who were racing and their performances were; Brian Gilligan '17 16:03, Jared Forman '13 16:36, Roy Wedge '14 17:25, Josh Feldman '97 17:36, Nicholas Waltman '18 18:32 and David Westenberg '80 18:49.  Those in attendance, unable to race due to injury were Bob Collins '82 and Don Shobrys '75.
    
    
                
    
    The women also got off to a strong start, but perhaps a little more sane that the men.  The alumnae were only able to round up four runners, so the scoring was adjusted to four finishers to comprise a complete team.
    
    
                
    
    At the mile mark Jenna Melanson '20 was in command of the lead at 6:16.  Izzi Gengaro '22 was two seconds back and both Leandra Zimmermann '19 and Marissa McPhillips '20 were at 6:20.  Mary Eccles '18, representing the alumnae was with Zimmermann and McPhillips.  There was an eight second gap before Einat Gavish '22 came through the mile mark.  She was closely followed by Emily Niu '21, Tessa Weiss '20, Abby Mauermann '22 and Emily Skilling '21.  Louise van den Heuvel '14, Alexandra Taylor '14 and Elaine McVay '15 were at the back of that group.
    
    
                
    
    Zimmermann closed the gap to join Melanson and Gengaro, but McPhillips was only four seconds back at the two mile mark.  Gavish and Mauermann remained the same distance behind McPhillips, but the others lost six to 14 seconds.  Eccles fell off a bit, but was still in fifth place overall.  van den Heuvel and Taylor moved up a bit.
    
    
                
    
    The varsity women swept the top four places with a 17 second delta and had a 40 second gap through five runners.  Melanson won in a course record 17:10.  Gengaro ran 17:13, Zimmermann 17:14 and McPhillips 17:27 for a 10 point perfect score.  Eccles was close at 17:35.  Gavish ran 17:50 and Mauermann closed nicely at 17:52, giving MIT three freshmen in the top six.  van den Heuvel ran 18:41, Taylor 18:56 and McVay 19:48.
    
    
                
    
    MIT's first intercollegiate competition will be the Purple Valley race, hosted by Williams College on September 24.

    ### Women Reach Podium With Third Place Finish
    
    
                  
    
     
    
    
                  
    
    #### Men Beat Seed, Finish 16th at NCAA DIII Championship
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    November 17, 2018
    
    
                
    
    The MIT Cross Country teams continued their theme of next person up this weekend at the NCAA Division III Cross Country championship, hosted by the University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh at the Lake Breeze Golf Course in Winneconne, WI.  The women, seeded fourth and riding a streak of nine straight years of top six finishes at this championship, had a number of individuals perform at an exceptional level to finish third among the 32 teams competing. The men overcame tremendous losses going into and during the season to move up from their seed of 20th in the country to finish 16th.
    
    
                
    
    The course at Lake Breeze, which was destroyed at the Pre-National meet in mid-October, had not totally recovered by race time.  Allowing athletes to get on the course on Thursday did further damage, so the course was shut down until race time.  The sub 30 temperatures kept the course from becoming too muddy and the snow bypassed the area to make for an outstanding race.
    
    
                
    
    Going into the season it was not clear the women would even reach the national championship, much less place third.  Leandra Zimmermann '19 was a returning All American in cross country, but had not run track the past year, so her conditioning was in question.  Katie Bacher '20 was injured from the outdoor season and taking a long time to return to action, still not running at all when the season started.  Katie Collins '21 had dropped out of the 2017 NCAA Division III Championship and was still not in a good place to be counted on.  Marissa McPhillips '20 had suffered through a number of collapses in cross country races and it was not predictable when it might happen again.  Jenna Melanson '20, an All America steeplechaser had not produced in cross country in the past, but would need to this year.  There were three freshmen who had okay high school performances, but nothing outstanding.  Long story short, the odds were not in the Engineer's favor.
    
    
                
    
    The women's race was first at 11:15.  The Engineers adopted a great attitude of "let's just see what we can do", embracing the challenge instead of fearing it.  Izzi Gengaro '22, MIT's number one runner for most of the season, who had missed the last three weeks due to an injury, would be racing, but no one knew how she would perform.  At the start, MIT was in box #2, on the same side as the first turn about 300 meters into the course, meaning the Engineers had to get out or get squeezed out at the turn.  Zimmermann  got out well for MIT, as did Einat Gavish '22, although she worked too hard to get there.  The others did not get out so well, but well enough to move up in the field. 
    
    
                
    
    At the mile mark Zimmermann was in 17th place in 5:39 and Gavish was in 36th place in 5:46.  Melanson, Gengaro  and McPhillips  were all out between 60th-100th place in 5:51-5:54.  Collins  and Bacher  were much further back, close to 200 in 6:00.  MIT continued to move up as the race progressed.  At the two mile mark Zimmermann was 12th, Melanson 45th and Gengaro around 65th.  Gavish had lost a lot of ground, falling back to ~70th, but Collins was all the way up to the top 100 along with McPhillips with Bacher only a couple seconds behind.
    
    
                
    
    At the three mile Zimmermann was hanging on in 14th place, but it was obvious she was fatigued.  Gengaro moved up slightly to 62nd, Melanson fell back to 66th, Collins was now up to 76th and Bacher was up to 107th and Gavish right with her.  In the final .73 we lost a bit, but it was not significant to the team places.  Zimmermann earned her second All America award with her 17th place finish in 21:34.  Gengaro moved up well to 54th in 22:12.  Collins continued to move up, finishing 72nd in 22:22.  Melanson hung on to finish fourth for MIT in 89th place in 22:28.  Bacher closed out our scoring in 103rd in 22:34 for a 1:00 gap for one through five.  Favored Johns Hopkins lost to Wash U by one point, 98 to 99.  We finished third with 247 points after the individual scorers were taken out, and UW Eau Claire was fourth with 265 points.
    
    
                
    
    All through the season when someone would have a bad day, someone else would step-up.  Zimmermann was a rock all season.  Gengaro put her doubts aside and raced extremely well.  Collins put her mental game together and delivered when it counted in the championship season.  Melanson had a bad day for her, but she hung tough to allow Tech to get on the podium.  Bacher fought through her rehab and much shortened season to step-up when her team needed it.  Job well done by the Engineers!
    
    
                
    
    The men's team at MIT had suffered numerous losses going into and during the season.  The loss of two-time All American Dennis Maloney '19 to a pre-graduate start up company hurt a lot.  The loss of two key top five freshmen early in season; Zach Johnson and Matthew Kearney dealt a big blow to the Engineers just as it lookd as though they may have a stellar team.  Fortunately, just as it looked as though they would not have a solid four or five runner, Josh Derrick '20, Aidan Gilson '19 and Alex Knapp '19 stepped up enough to get the team to nationals.
    
    
                
    
    The men's race did not start the way MIT had hoped.  There was a recall start due to two MIT runners (Josh Derrick '20 and Ryan Wilson '22) going down shortly after the start.  In the second start Andrew Mah '22 got out well, as did Aidan Gilson '19 and Billy Woltz '20, but the rest of the Engineers were very far back with Josh Rosenkranz '19, Alex Knapp, Derrick and Wilson back in the mid to upper 200's.  At the mile mark Mah was out great in 33rd place at a conservative 4:57.  Woltz was close behind in 42nd, Rosenkranz in the mid-80's, Knapp was back in about 135th and Gilson was in the 150's.  Derrick and Wilson were out of it in the back.
    
    
                
    
    At the two mile mark Mah had moved up to 25th and Rosenkranz to 78th, However, Woltz fell back to 98th.  Knapp was pretty constant in the mid 130's and Gilson had moved up a few spots.  However, by the end of 8K the team gave away the spots for which they fought so hard.  Mah finished in 66th in 25:21, Rosenkranz 112th in 20:32, Knapp was 148th in 20:46, Gilson placed 157th in 20:51 and Woltz finished 164th in 20:56.  The 35 second delta was impressive, but too far back to be very high up in the team places. Placing 16th with 465 points was a success.
    
    
                
    
    Overall, the team performed well.  While Woltz had been the number one runner in the middle of the season, Mah stepped up when Woltz fell off.  Knapp and Gilson performed well as did Rosenkranz, giving the three seniors much of the credit for the Engineer's success.
    
    
                
    
    Next year, the women will have lost their number one runner, but should be quite strong with three seniors and a lot of national championship experience.  The men will graduate three from this class, but with one exceptional freshman class in place and hopefully one more on the way, the future looks much brighter going into 2019 than it did going into 2018.

    ### Freshmen Lead Engineers to NEICAAA Podium
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    October 6, 2018
    
    
                
    
    The NEICAAA Championship is a stand alone championship where the Division I, II and III teams get a chance to compete against one another at historic Franklin Park in Boston, Massachusetts.  While many teams prefer out of region meets the week before, bypassing this meet, many more take part to make it a very competitive competition.
    
    
                
    
    MIT's women, ranked fourth nationally in Division III, were racing without All Americans Marissa McPhillips '20 and Katie Bacher '20, but showed a very talented squad that took second place with 78 points, losing only to Division I Boston College.
    
    
                
    
    The men's race showcased 26 teams, including Division II nationally ranked #18 American International and #24 Stonehill College.  MIT claimed third with 125 points, losing to UMass Amherst and Northeastern University, both Division I teams.
    
    
                
    
    This was a nice cross country day in that the temperatures, while humid, were in the mid-60's.  The course was soft and muddy in spots, but in pretty good condition overall.
    
    
                
    
    The first race of the day was the women's sub-varsity 5K.  Lindsey McAllister '21, still coming back from injury, led the way for MIT, placing 22nd in 19:30.  Gabby Enns '21 had a breakout race, placing 32nd in 19:39 and running a very smart, well-paced 5K.  Tessa Weiss '20, also returning from injury and running her first race this year, finished 45th in 19:56.  Dhaman Kaur '21 place 67th and Megan McCandless '20, racing her first race of the year, placed 74th.
    
    
                
    
    The women's varsity 5K was next.  With McPhillips out for personal reasons and Bacher still coming back from injury, the engineers needed their runners to step up.  At the mile mark, Jenna Melanson '20 led Leandra Zimmermann '19, Izzi Gengaro '22 and Katie Collins '21 at 5:39 in around 25th-30th place.  Einat Gavish '22 and Emily Niu '21 were back in 60th-65th position in 5:49.  By the second mile, Gengaro had moved up to 10th with Melanson 11th and Zimmermann in 13th.  Collins was in 20th and Gavish 26th.  All looked pretty strong at this point and appeared to still be moving up in the field.  While Gengaro was able to move up to 6th in 18:07, and Collins to 17th in 18:35, Zimmermann and Melanson fell back to 14th and 15th respectively in 18:24 and 18:26.  Gavish held onto 26th in 18:54 to round out the scoring.  The 47 second gap was as impressive as the individual performances, particular the efforts by freshmen Gengaro and Gavish.
    
    
                
    
    In the men's varsity 8K, all MIT runners were present, but Josh Rosenkranz '19 and Josh Derrick '20 were getting over  illnesses and a number of freshmen were being counted on in only their second 8K.  At the mile mark, Aidan Gilson '19, Andrew Mah '22, Billy Woltz '20 and Rosenkranz  led the Engineers in 4:51 at around 50th place.  Derrick  led Zach Johnson '22 and Nicky Medearis '22 as MIT's second group and were between 70th-80th place in 4:55.  By mile two Tech runners had moved up significantly with Woltz in 28th with Mah, Rosenkranz and Gilson right with him.  Johnson had moved up to 43rd and Derrick was up to 50th.  Mah took over in the third mile, moving up to 17th.  Woltz and Rosenkranz were in 19th and 21st, but Gilson was falling back quickly.  Fortunately Johnson had moved up to 27th and Derrick 40th.  In the final two miles Mah was able to move up to eighth, but then lost one place right at the finish in 25:15.  Woltz moved up to 18th in 25:32, but Rosenkranz, obviously not at the top of his game, faded slightly to 27th in 25:41.  Johnson held up well for a freshman but lost some ground, finishing 32nd in 25:46.  Derrick closed well, placing 39th in 25:52.  Medearis lost some in the middle miles but finished well, placing 59th in 26:12.  Three freshman in the top six was quite an impressive effort for the class of '22.
    
    
                
    
    The final race of the day was the sub-varsity 8K.  Ryan Wilson '22 ran a smart, conservative first half-mile, got to where he needed to be by the mile mark, around 40th place in 5:02.  Kent Slaney '21 was more aggressive, particularly in the first half-mile at 2:27, but at mile two was leading the way for MIT in eighth place in 10:18.  Wilson and Daniel Weiss '19 were eight seconds back in 11th and 12th.  Back in 16th, having the race of his career, was Jake Jorgensen and in 18th and 20th were teammates Alex Knapp '19 and Nassim Oufattole '22.  They were chasing Northeastern University who were in 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 at that point. By mile four Wilson had passed Slaney and Jorgensen had passed Weiss.  Most surprising of all, Finn Jacobson-Schulte '21 came out of nowhere to move within four seconds of Weiss.  At the finish, MIT was still second to NU 17 to 51 with only Wilson breaking up the sweep.  Wilson was sixth overall in 26:13.  Slaney finished 12th in 26:38, followed closely by Weiss in 14th in 26:42.  Jacobson-Schulte was 17th in 26:44 for a breakthrough race and Jorgensen 18th in 26:45 to close out the scoring.
    
    
                
    
    Next week MIT will take a select group of runners to the Pre-National meet hosted by the University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh at the Lake Breeze course in Winneconne, WI.

    ### Engineers Construct Another NEWMAC Double Championship
    
    
                  
    
     
    
    
                  
    
    #### Men Earn 21st in succession, Women Win 12th
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    October 27, 2018
    
    
                
    
    From a spectator's point of view the weather could not have been more miserable for the 2018 NEWMAC Cross Country Championship.  The rain was constant since early in the morning.  The temperature in the low 40's and the wind was blowing harder as the meet progressed.  From the runner's point of view, it could not have been better.  This weather defines cross country and the Engineers embraced the elements, the men winning their 21st consecutive title with 17 points to runner-up WPI's 52, and the women claiming their 12th in a row with 20 points to WPI's 71.
    
    
                
    
    The Smith College course is quite hilly with a lot of turns, so when you add significant amounts of mud, the pace tends to slow down.  MIT worked on group running rather than trying to set any performance records.  The men did not take the lead until they had passed three miles, and that was more that everyone else slowed down as the course reached the downhill stage except for the final uphill with about two thirds of a mile to go.
    
    
                
    
    Billy Woltz '20 worked with Andrew Mah '22 and Josh Rosenkranz '19 through four miles before opening up a small lead with 800 to go and then managed to out-sprint Mah to the finish for a three second victory 26:14 to 26:17.  The teammates won NEWMAC Runner of the Year and Rookie of the Year respectively.  Rosenkranz was another eight seconds back and Josh Derrick '20 at 26:32 was only :18 back of Woltz in fourth.  Brian Brooks '22 from WPI broke up the MIT sweep, but Alex Knapp '19 had a career race to finish fifth for MIT and sixth overall in 26:40, giving MIT a 27 second delta through five runners.
    
    
                
    
    Aidan Gilson '19 (26:48) and Kent Slaney '21 (27:01) added all-conference honors for MIT as they placed seventh and ninth respectively.  Both Gilson and Slaney will have to step-up to their top five ability if the men are to three-peat as New England region champions in two weeks at Bowdoin College.
    
    
                
    
    The women were without number one runner, Izzi Gengaro '22, who was out for precautionary reasons, but that just gave others the opportunity to show what they could do in the messy conditions.  The MIT women did not go out with the leader, sticking with the plan to work on their group running, which brought them through the mile mark in 6:34.  Trailing the second place runner until the 1 1/2 mile mark.  Jenna Melanson '20 and Leandra Zimmermann '19 took off, opening up an immediate gap on their teammates and other runners.  Kaitlyn Mooney '21 from Coast Guard was well out in front by 20 or more seconds, but behind her Tech was putting together quite the team performance.
    
    
                
    
    Katie Bacher '20, making her varsity debut this year after coming back from an achilles tendon injury and a very recent sprained ankle, was in fourth all alone.  Einat Gavish '22 and Marissa McPhillips '20 were holding down fifth and sixth a few seconds behind Bacher.  Katie Collins '21 was in eighth and trying to make up ground to get up with her teammates.
    
    
                
    
    After another mile and a half and Mooney's victory in 18:39, Melanson finished 21 seconds back in 19:00.  Zimmermann was just four seconds back in 19:04. Bacher finished fourth in 19:18, McPhillips in fifth in 19:28 and Gavish in sixth in 19:32.  The :32 delta was impressive, especially without Gengaro competing.
    
    
                
    
    Adding to the all-conference list were Collins in eighth, Emily Niu '21 in 12th, Lindsey McAllister '21in 15th and Tessa Weiss '20 in 16th.  Gavish earned Rookie of the Year honors as the top finishing freshman.
    
    
                
    
    In two weeks the women will attempt to three-peat at the NCAA New England Region Championship when they compete in that 6K championship at Bowdoin College.

    ### Women 2nd, Men 10th at Pre-Nats
    
    
                  
    
     
    
    
                  
    
    #### MIT Has Work To Do!
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    October 13, 2018
    
    
                
    
    MIT traveled to the Division III Pre-National meet and was hoping to discover how they fared against national level competition from outside their region while also getting an opportunity to see the national championship course at Lake Breeze golf course in Winneconne, WI, hosted by the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.
    
    
                
    
    The course was so inundated by rain over the past two weeks that it had to be altered a bit and no teams were allowed on the course the day before.  Even with this the course was wet, soft and muddy before the races even started.
    
    
                
    
    Going into the week it was discovered that MIT lost their number four runner, freshman Zach Johnson, for the season due to injury.  With a significant gap  after their fifth runner, the Engineers would now have to see if someone would step up to make up for the loss of Johnson, who averaged 18 seconds from Tech's top finisher.
    
    
                
    
    The field was impressive with 50 teams in both the men's and women's fields.  For the women, other than the fourth ranked Engineers, competing were #2 Washington of St Louis, #5 UW Eau Claire, #6 Carleton, #9 Hope, #12 Wheaton (IL), #13 Pomona Pitzer, #15 Calvin, #21 Wartburg, #21 Otterbein, #23 North Central, #24 Bates, #26 Chicago, #28 Emory and #31 St. Thomas.  Of course early season rankings are guess work at best so the muddy course would certainly see which teams knew how to race cross country under such conditions and give the rankings a good shake-up.
    
    
                
    
    MIT was concerned about getting out too fast on the 6K course and were also trying to be aware of Wash U and Eau Claire runners.  At the mile mark, Wash U had runners in third, sixth and 20th, but their next runners were in 57th and 87th for a total of 153 points.  MIT went out conservatively at 5:56-6:00 pace for their top six runners with Izzi Gengaro '22 in 18th, Jenna Melanson '20 19th, Leandra Zimmermann '19 23rd, Katie Collins '21 27th, Marissa McPhillips '20 29th and Einat Gavish '22 in 30th position for a total of 116 points.  Even though MIT put a pretty good effort into the second mile, Wash U showed their dominance, moving up to within twenty points 97 to 117.  In the third mile, Gengaro moved up to 10th, Zimmerman to 15th, Melanson to 16th, Gavish to 27th and Collins to 29th.  However, Wash U pushed hard in the back and now had an 87 to 97 point edge with runners in 2, 5, 11, 34 and 35 positions.
    
    
                
    
    At the finish, MIT lost a few places from their fourth and fifth finishers, totaling 107 points.  Wash U's fourth and fifth runners continued to move up, giving them 70 points and a clear victory.  Third place overall went to Brandeis with 213 points.  
    
    
                
    
    MIT finished where they were seeded, and freshmen Gengaro and Gavish ran superb races.  However, if MIT wishes to move up to the top two teams in the country they need to either move up their top runners or close the gap between three and four/five, which stood at :41 and :48 in this race.
    
    
                
    
    By the time the men stepped up to the starting line the course was a mud bath and was getting significantly worse with each runner.  Strategy was difficult to balance.  Getting out hard among the leaders meant you were taking a huge risk in blowing up since the energy return from the ground was so discounted, but running conservatively early meant trying to move up in the field on a muddy course and having to pass so many runners.
    
    
                
    
    MIT was seeded seventh in the field of nationally ranked teams, which were #1 North Central, #3 Pomona Pitzer, #5 Haverford, #6 Wash U, #9 Calvin, #11 Wartburg, #14 MIT, #15 Chicago, #18 UW Stout, #20 UW Eau Claire, #20 Carleton, #24 Otterbein, #31 Emory, #32 UW Stevens Point and #33 Washington and Lee.
    
    
                
    
    MIT runners chose the very conservative route and at the mile mark were very far back with Billy Woltz '20 in 88th place, Andrew Mah '22 in 89th place, Josh Rosenkranz in 92nd place, Aidan Gilson in 110th place, Josh Derrick in 122nd, Nicky Medearis '22 in 150th and Ryan Wilson '22 in 162nd.  All were between 5:10 and 5:17.  They pushed from that point on and by mile three were in 47th, 48th and 51st with Rosenkranz, Woltz and Mah.  Derrick was in 54th, however, Gilson had fallen to 128th and Wilson was only up to 135th.
    
    
                
    
    As the course got worse, MIT found it difficult to go anywhere but backwards.  Woltz moved up slightly to 43rd place.  Derrick moved up to 49th but Rosenkranz fell back to 56th.  The biggest losses came when Mah lost in the final two miles what he had gained in the previous two, falling back to 89th place.  Wilson passed Gilson, finishing as Tech's number five runner in 131st place to total 368 points. The Engineers finished in 10th place behind North Central (41 pts), Wash U (97 pts), Calvin (127 pts), Haverford (144 pts), Pomona Pitzer (277 pts), UW Stout (302 pts), Otterbein (305 pts), Wartburg (314 pts) and Chicago (314 pts).
    
    
                
    
    Being so far back in the field at the mile mark made it a challenge physically to move up with the conditions and mentally in that it was difficult to be motivated by being so far back they could not see the front.  Overall, the 45 second final delta by MIT's top five was excellent over the 8K. However, having the highest finisher in 43rd place would not get the job done.
    
    
                
    
    MIT's next race will be the NEWMAC Conference Championship at Smith College on October 27th.  The men have never lost the championship in its 20 year history.  The women have won every title since 2007.

    #### Women Win Purple Valley, Men Finish Fifth
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    September 22, 2018
    
    
                
    
    The MIT Engineers Cross Country teams traveled to Williamstown, MA to race in the Purple Valley Classic hosted by Williams College, racing against intercollegiate competition for the first time this year.  The stellar field included many nationally ranked teams.  For the men, of the 16 teams racing the hilly 8K course, nationally ranked Amherst (3rd), RPI (6th), MIT (7th), Middlebury (8th), Williams (17th), Connecticut College (24th) and Tufts (28th) were heading the field.  The women's field boasted a slightly weaker field, but only slightly, among the 13 teams; MIT (5th), Middlebury (6th), Williams (8th), Tufts (11th) and RPI (12th).
    
    
                
    
    It was a breezy day with ideal temperatures, for late September at least, in the mid-60's.  The course was wet and even quite muddy back in the woods.  Unfortunately, for the men, they did not apply their intelligence and realize they would not get the same energy out of the ground they would be putting in on such a soft and muddy course.
    
    
                
    
    When the men started out towards the front instead of running behind top ranked Amherst, they set themselves up to die hard and die they did.  After being relatively competitive with the top teams through two miles, the fast pace (for the course) and the large hill in mile two, did them in. 
    
    
                
    
    While the top five gap was fabulous (:38) given that both Aidan Gilson '19 and Kent Slaney '21 went out the back after three miles, MIT's top runner, Josh Rosenkranz '19 was :41 off the winner in 26:25, Sean O'Connor '19 of RPI.  In fact RPI put four runners in front of MIT's #1, nearly sweeping them.
    
    
                
    
    The team ran tough, particularly the freshmen, with Zach Johnson '22 placing 25th overall in 26:39, and third on the team, right behind teammate Billy Woltz '20 in 26:38.  Andrew Mah '22, also going out too hard, held on remarkably well for a freshman, finishing fourth on the team and 28th overall in 26:42.  Closing out the scoring for Tech was Josh Derrick '20 in 27:03 and 41st place.  Derrick has only just started back running after dealing with numerous injuries, displaying his toughness.
    
    
                
    
    The men placed fifth overall with 127 points.  RPI won with 41 points.  Williams was second with 72, Middlebury 103, and Amherst with 118.
    
    
                
    
    The women, down three All Americans; Jenna Melanson '20, Katie Bacher '20 and Megan McCandless '20, were hoping to work on their gap as well. Keeping a small delta when missing three of your top five would be a major feat.
    
    
                
    
    Fortunately the pace at the start of the race was cautious.  Even when Kaitlyn Mooney '21 of Coast Guard took off before the mile mark and Natalie Bettez '19 of Tufts went after her, the rest of the field settled in for the team race.
    
    
                
    
    MIT positioned themselves well early on with Leandra Zimmermann '19 and Izzi Gengaro '22 up in the top five and Katie Collins '21, Marissa McPhillips '20,  and Einat Gavish '22 formed up once Collins fell off the lead group and worked well together between 10th and 15th place for most of the race.
    
    
                
    
    In the final three quarters of a mile of the 6K, Zimmermann and Gengaro pulled away by over 20 seconds from fifth place, earning third and fourth in 22:39 and 22:41 respectively.  McPhilips started falling back in the final 400, fell and labored in, placing 6th for MIT and 35th overall.  Gavish, who placed 17th overall and 3rd on the team, ran an excellent race in 23:31.  Collins placed 19th in 23:34.  Emily Niu '21 came out of nowhere to finish fifth for the Engineers, closing out the scoring with her 24th place in 23:41.  Overall MIT finished first with 67 points, 14 points ahead of Williams.
    
    
                
    
    Even though the women won, the 1:02 gap for their top five is a major concern, particularly with the :50 gap between the second and third finishers.
    
    
                
    
    The Engineers next race will be at the NEICAAA Championship at Franklin Park against primarily Division I competition on October 6.

    ### Women Win Third Consecutive NCAA D3 New England Title
    
    
                  
    
     
    
    
                  
    
    #### Men Advance to Nationals on Fourth Place Finish
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    November 10, 2018
    
    
                
    
    Accustomed to less than ideal racing conditions this season, the Women's Cross Country team from MIT felt right at home with the rain soaked, muddy course at Bowdoin College, host of the NCAA Division III New England Region championship.  Despite a fast start and losing quite a bit of ground in the final mile, the women turned in a three-peat, winning the title for the third year in a row, scoring 87 points to outscore 56 other teams.
    
    
                
    
    The team's strategy was to go out aggressively despite not having done so all season.  Leandra Zimmermann '19, the only senior on the team, went out with the leaders, blasting out in 5:34 for the first mile.  She was sitting in fifth at that point.  The remainder of the top six MIT harriers, led by Jenna Melanson '20, were all between eighth and 14th, running between 5:44 and 5:46.  
    
    
                
    
    The pace settled a bit after that first mile as the soft ground started getting to everyone's legs.  After the two mile mark Zimmermann was in sixth with Melanson still in eighth.  Katie Collins '21 was having the race of her year in 10th.  Katie Bacher '20 and Einat Gavish '22 were in 14th and 15th, but looking as though they were losing focus and not racing with the same intensity as their teammates ahead of them.  Marissa McPhillips '20 was in 18th, looking totally defeated.  On the plus side, Middlebury and Williams, MIT's two main opponents, had not started aggressively for the most part and were pretty far back.  Middlebury's first two runners were aggressive, starting out in the front pack, were now in fifth and seventh.  Their next three runners were in 23rd, 35th and 44th.  Williams was very cautious, running 19th, 27th, 30th, 41st and 42nd.
    
    
                
    
    The question to be answered, would the cautious approach work and the Middlebury and Williams runners catch the dying Engineers from MIT.  At the finish not much changed at the front of the race.  Zimmermann finished sixth in 21:38 on the 6K course.  Melanson held ground for the most part, finishing in 10th in 22:18 and Collins finished an outstanding 12th in 21:20.  Then it got interesting.  Bacher slid to 27th in 22:40 and Gavish dropped to 32nd in 22:47.  The 1:09 gap was the higherst all season for Tech and would need fixing at Nationals.  Emily Niu '21 finished  77th for MIT in 23:33.  McPhillips dropped out of sight to 86th place in 23:44.
    
    
                
    
    Middlebury and Williams both moved up significantly, but not enough to upset MIT.  Middlebury finished with 108 points, placing 5, 8, 28, 31 and 36.  Williams finished in third with 115 points, placing 13, 19, 20, 26 and 37.
    
    
                
    
    MIT was seeded fourth in the men's race, but the two-time defending champions had not been favored either of the two previous years which they won, so the plan was to go for it.  However, since the course was much worse after the women raced on it, and the women had shown some dying off at the end, the men were guardedly aggressive.
    
    
                
    
    Early on in the race MIT was in a solid position, but everyone seemed to have the same plan, making it a free for all up front.  Andrew Mah '22 showed his championship attitude as he was solidly with the front pack in about seventh place through the first two miles, splitting 9:57.  Kent Slaney '21, a very talented runner, was trying to conquer the mental side of his racing woes, but was already starting to fall back as he went from one second back from Mah at the mile mark to seven seconds back to the two mile mark.  Josh Rosenkranz '19 was steadily moving up, currently at 10:05 in 19th place.  Billy Woltz '20, who had wanted to be aggressive and was planning on finishing among the top runners, was moving up, but still in about 26th place.  Josh Derrick '20 was still back quite a bit in 50th place, but he has been very successful at moving up in races throughout the season.
    
    
                
    
    By the end of the fourth mile, Mah had fallen off the leaders but was still in eighth place in 20:11.  Rosenkranz was in 19th, but 21 second back at 20:32.  Woltz was now in third for Tech in 32nd place at 20:44 with Derrick only three spots back at 20:45.  With Slaney going out the back it was now up to either Aidan Gilson '19 or Alex Knapp '19 to come through as the fifth runner.  Last year, Gilson had stepped up to finish 12th overall and second for MIT, helping his team to victory.  This year Gilson has been struggling, but today he was battling hard and hanging onto a place in the mid-40's.
    
    
                
    
    In the final mile, Mah lost a few spots to finish 13th for Tech in 25:24.  Rosenkranz placed 19th in 25:43, Derrick moved past Woltz, who had been MIT's top runner the past two races, finishing in 31st and 32nd place in 25:55 and 25:56 respectively.  Gilson closed out the scoring in 50th place in 26:12.  
    
    
                
    
    MIT totaled a respectable 145 points to finish in their predicted fourth place.  It was heartbreaking as they lost to third place Middlebury by three points.  Amherst College won with an impressive 65 points and Williams was second in the 58 team field with 86 points.
    
    
                
    
    All four of those teams will advance to the NCAA Division III Championship at the Lake Breeze Golf Course in Winneconne, WI, hosted by the University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh on November 17.
