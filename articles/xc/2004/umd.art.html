  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT RUNS THROUGH RAIN SOAKED COURSE FOR 3RD PLACE</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">September 18, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">The MIT Engineers visited UMass Dartmouth for their annual invitational 
    with hopes of measuring their position within the ranks of New England's best 
    Division three teams. What they got was a third place finish against a good 
    field of 29 teams and a lesson on running through the final punch of hurricane 
    Ivan.</p>
  <p align="left">Despite the deluge that brought nearly five inches of rain, 
    John Brewer went out with the lead group of runners, outside of the leading 
    Japanese national team who were not involved in the team scoring. Brewer went 
    out a little fast, but was still able to hold on for a personal best of 25:53, 
    breaking twenty six minutes for the first time. Once the fourth mile started 
    the lead runners were able to pull away from a fatiguing Brewer but no one 
    from the chase group was able to catch him.</p>
  <p align="left">While the fast start helped Brewer achieve his place and time, 
    it served to break up the group plan and left Eric Khatchadourian and Carlos 
    Renjifo to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, Bates College, a team whose 
    time has come, took a page out of the MIT book and performed group running 
    to perfection. A trio of Bobcats ran together, catching three MIT runners 
    in the final two miles to lead Bates to victory. Not only did MIT's lead group 
    break up at the beginning but the second group never even formed. Kevin Brulois 
    ran a competitive race but may have also started too hard. This strung out 
    his group of Chris Bruce, Spencer Dudley and Chris Wong.</p>
  <p align="left">Brown University started out in front, depending on their front 
    running style to deliver a second place finish as Bates College ran down their 
    fatiguing runners in the final miles. Tufts University, the defending New 
    England Division III champions, only ran two of their varsity runners and 
    placed eigth.</p>
  <p align="left">In the sub-varsity race, which preceded the varsity race, Fivos 
    Constantinou returned to racing with a victory and a personal best time of 
    26:43. Constantinou ran a very conservative start and had plenty left to catch 
    the leaders as he made up over 100 meters in the final mile and a half. Two 
    of those he walked down were teammates Kevin DiGenova and Erik Stafl who had 
    fought the entire race trying to take the lead. DiGenova and Stafl place third 
    and fourth respectively in the team running to help MIT to a big victory with 
    27 points to 41 to Bates. Also running a great race for MIT was Martin Holmes, 
    knocking 50 seconds off his personal best in his seventh place finish.</p>
  <p align="left">After taking next weekend off from racing, MIT will travel to 
    the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire to race Pre-Nationals on Friday, October 
    1, the site of the NCAA Division III Championships. Ben Schmeckpeper, All 
    America runner and defending New England Division III champion will return 
    to racing at this meet, which should give MIT a true evaluation of their national 
    ranking.</p>
