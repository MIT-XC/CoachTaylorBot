  <p><strong><font size="+3">SCHMECKPEPER ENDS COLLEGIATE CROSS COUNTRY CAREER 
    WITH EIGHTH PLACE FINISH AT NATIONALS</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">November 20, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">Bringing a fitting climax to a spectacular collegiate career 
    in the sport of cross country, Ben Schmeckpeper made the best of his fourth 
    consecutive NCAA Division III Championship opportunity by finishing in eighth 
    place with a time 24:49, earning his second All America Award.</p>
  <p align="left">The NCAA Division III Regional Male Runner of the Year, Schmeckpeper, 
    a Wisconsin native from Shorewood, thought he could make a run for the individual 
    title here at the White Tail Golf Course in Colfax, Wisconsin. The meet, hosted 
    by the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, began with temperatures in the 
    upper 30's and a brisk wind swirling around the course. The favorite to win, 
    defending champion Josh Moen of Wartburg College, wasted no time in taking 
    command of the race. Shortly after the mile mark, Moen gapped the field. Schmeckpeper 
    and a couple of others made the attempt to get back with Moen, but he made 
    a second surge and no one ever made up the difference.</p>
  <p align="left">Schmeckpeper made the effort to gradually get back to the leader, 
    and in the process left himself vulnerable to the small pack that was content 
    with racing for second place. Last year's runner up, Macharia Yuot of Widener 
    College, was the only one to come close to Moen, closing the gap to within 
    20 meters at three and a half miles into the race. Shortly after that, he 
    paid the price, eventually falling back to 24th place. Schmeckpeper also paid 
    the price, falling from third place at the three mile mark to 11th place just 
    before the four mile mark. The last mile, a gradual hill going up for approximately 
    a half mile, followed by a gradual downhill to the finish, challenged Schmeckpeper 
    not to fall back and to continue to fight for one of the top spots.</p>
  <p align="left">Just as he refused to end his cross country career without going 
    for the individual title, Schmeckpeper refused to give up without putting 
    every ounce of effort into his final race. Coming into the finish Schmeckpeper 
    moved up to eighth place and held it to match the second highest NCAA finish 
    by an MIT individual (Jesse Darley '95) in the past 20 years. Only Dan Feldman 
    in 2001, who finished in fourth, has finished higher in this illustrious race.</p>
  <p align="left">After some time of getting his base mileage back, Schmeckpeper 
    is looking forward to his final indoor and outdoor track seasons where he 
    hopes to match this years cross country success.</p>
