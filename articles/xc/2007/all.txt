    **@ Franklin Park**
    
    
      
    
    September 1, 2007
    
    
      
    
    The varsity women and men ran away from their former teammates and older alums in the annual Alumni/ae meet held at Franklin Park to claim victories for both programs. The women lined up first on this beautiful, sunny day. The varsity women won the meet 17 to 23 scoring four runners. The varsity men won in a sweep 15 to 49, but if scored using age-graded tables the meet was bit closer with the varsity pulling it out 27 to 32. 
    
    
      
    
    Holding out a number of their runners the varsity ran a patient and conservative race to gradually put themselves in command halfway through the race. The alumnae were represented by only four runners but those four ran very well. Betsy Eames claimed first place honors with a 19:56 performance. Martha Buckley held on for third place in 20:21, almost running down freshman Katy Gordon, who ran 20:17, for second. Margaret Nervegna and Jen Gaugler, deciding to race at the last minute, made a valliant effort early in the race but were unable to hold onto their positions. The varsity was able to pack in their runners fourth through eighth to secure the victory. Finishing fourth was another freshman, Anna Holt-Gosselin in 20:46. Liz Labuz completed the race in fifth overall in 20:55. Adrienne Bolger, Kirsten Aarsvold and Jennifer Doyle finished up the varsity team, running 21:10, 21:11 and 21:24 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    The men's race had many more competitors (39) with the alumni being represented by 14 "Has-Beens". With Jake Ruzevick and Yermie Cohen taking the day off from racing, Joe Roy-Mayhew took control of the race right from the gun, coming through the first mile alone in 5:04. Eric Khatchadourian, Ethan Crain and Terry McNatt made the most of it for the alumni in the first mile by giving chase and putting themselves in a position to control the race. However, the perseverance and even pacing of the varsity was too much for the old-timers as they were caught one by one. Trevor Rundell ran an outstanding race to finish in second place to Roy-Mayhew 26:39 to 26:20. Following Rundell were Brian Jacokes in 26:44, Chris Bruce in 26:47 and Tyler Abrams in 26:52 to finish up the sweep with a :32 delta. Top freshman honors went to Gihan Amarasiriwardena in 26:57. The varsity showed their depth with nine more runners under 28:00.
    
    
      
    
    In age-graded scoring Sumner Brown, class of 1966, earned first place honors, earning a 25:24 conversion from his 32:26 performance. Bob Collins '82 also received a big bonus from the scoring tables, moving from 29:09 to 26:06 to earn third place overall. Terry McNatt '87 moved up to 5th place overall with 26:20 conversion from 28:18. Eric Khatchadourian '07 received no bonus at 27:00. Finishing up the scoring for the alums was Ethan Crain '95 who ran 27:37, converting to 27:09.

    Josh Feldman and David Moyle had every intention of racing but both faced unbelievable traffic on the way to Boston, both arriving late for the start.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, both the men and women travel to Smith College to run in the Smith College Invitational. The Engineer's Cup, involving MIT, RPI and WPI, will be scored out of the Invitational. Both teams will need to step up their effort. The women in particular need to close down their top five delta, which in this past race was :54 without the top two runners.

    **HARRIERS DISPLAY DEPTH IN CONN. COLLEGE INVITE WITHOUT TOP RUNNERS**
    
    
      
    
    September 22, 2007
    
    
      
    
    MIT traveled on Saturday to Harkness Park in Waterford, CT, to race in the Connecticut College Cross Country Invitational. The day was hot and humid whenever the sun was out and it seemed to come out as soon as the women's race was about to start and didn't go back in until both races were over. Despite the excellent competition and the flat, fast course, MIT held out the top two runners from both the men's and women's teams for a combination of reasons. The supporting runners needed to step-up and take ownership of the outcome and they did not fail. On the women's side, Jacqui Wentz lady the Lady Engineers to a fifth place finish among the 14 teams with 109 points on the 6K course. Their total was 36 points behind the winning team, the host Camels. The men were led by Brian Jacokes to a sixth place finish among the 19 teams with 129 points.
    
    
      
    
    The NCAA Division III Regional Qualifier will be held on this course so the Engineers wanted to get a good look at the course. The women planned to get out a little faster than usual, hoping to take advantage of the flat course. The extremely humid conditions took a toll on the runners but most runners managed to endure the discomfort. Wentz is returning to her form she displayed early in her freshman year last year. She went out in ninth place and managed to stay there, finishing in 23:34. Katy Gordon stayed with Wentz stride for stride through three miles but didn't have the finishing speed, falling back to 12th in 23: 43. Liz Labuz, who went out just off of Wentz and Gordon, fell back a bit in the second mile but ran tough in the third mile to hold onto 19th in 23:59. If Monks and Bucala had raced this would have meant a team victory, but rest and recovery are more important this early in the season.
    
    
      
    
    Without Jake Ruzevick and Yermie Cohen racing for Tech, Joe Roy-Mayhew, Brian Jacokes and Trevor Rundell shared the pace setting honors for MIT. The trio ran outstanding, coming through the mile in 5:00 and only having a very small deviation between mile splits with Jacokes having the best at 17 seconds. The group could not move up on the talented field, which included the second ranked team in the country, New York University, nationally ranked St. Lawrence University and Brandeis University as well as Division II New England powerhouses, Stonehill College and Southern Connecticut State and Division I juggernaut, UConn. They did hold on however, Jacokes finishing in 18th place in 26:04 with Rundell and Roy-Mayhew supporting with 19th and 26th place efforts in 26:07 and 26:19 respectively. Finishing the scoring for Tech were Hemu Arumugam, finishing 32nd in 26:25 and Chris Wong, placing 36th in 26:30. The :26 delta was impressive for MIT as they also had three additional runners under 27:00. 
    
    
      
    
    The Engineers do not race next weekend, not racing again until October 6 at the New England Intercollegiate Championship at Franklin Park with the women starting at 12:00 and the men at 1:30.

    **FINN COMPETES WELL FIRST TIME AT NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    November 17, 2007
    
    
      
    
    After narrowly missing the qualification mark for the NCAA Division III Cross Country National Championship her freshman year in 2005 and working through a season long injury in 2006, Elizabeth Finn placed 20th at the New England Regional meet on November 10th to squeeze into the pack of those chosen to run at the national competition this year.   She traveled to St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota this weekend as an individual entrant along with six other individuals and five full teams from New England.   In all, 280 women from all over the U.S. competed in the six kilometer championship.
    
    
      
    
    Light snow dusted the fields surrounding the course on Saturday morning as the athletes arrived.   Although the temperature was in the high 30's, the wind made it feel cooler.   This encouraged Finn, who originates from Illinois and enjoys running in the snow.   Although she started the race with gloves and a homemade headband, she quickly warmed up and tossed them in the bushes.  
    
    
      
    
    Elizabeth knew the competition would be strong, but after reading on the clock that she'd run her first mile in 5:45, she faltered a bit and slowed during her second mile.   Realizing her error on a spectator-less loop around a pond, Finn refocused and picked up her pace.   Just before the largest hill in the race, she spotted a competitor from Williams she had wanted to beat all year.   Quickening her pace, the MIT junior made her move and passed her target; this gave Finn the encouragement to continue pushing for the last two kilometers.
    
    
      
    
    In the end, Finn placed 100th in the field and did not allow anyone to pass her in the last mile.   Her goal was to place in the top 50, but after running the race, she admitted she may have underestimated the other runners.   Always looking on the bright side and learning from her experiences, she expressed pleasure at having beaten many of the girls who out raced her the previous week at Regionals.   Already anticipating next year's cross country season, she hopes she, along with her team, will qualify for the national championship event.

    **Elizabeth Finn Qualifies Individually**
    
    
      
    
    November 11, 2007
    
    
      
    
    MIT Men's and Women's Cross Country teams allowed a great opportunity to slip through their hands today at the NCAA Division III New England Regional Cross Country Championship hosted by Connecticut College at Harkness Memorial State Park. The men, seeded fourth going into the meet believed they had a chance to win the meet based on the results over the past six weeks. However, they were not able to hold their position at the two and a half mile mark, losing significant ground in the final half of the 8000 meter race to finish sixth out of 36 teams with 163 points, 46 points out of first and 13 points away from qualifying for the NCAA Championships. The women, seeded fifth going into the race were a bit banged up and knew a top five finish was the best they could expect. A lack of confidence and aggressiveness pushed them out of the top five into a distant 7th out of 47 teams with 282 points. Nevertheless this was the highest finish in the history of the program.
    
    
      
    
    The men's race started well for MIT as being on the far left of the starting line they needed to get out quickly so they did not get caught on the inside of the first turn, which was only a couple hundred yards from the start. With the course being quite flat there were no concerns with getting into the front of the pack by the first mile, which MIT did quite well in a pedestrian like 4:59. At the two and a half mile mark they had moved up with Jake Ruzevick, one of the favorites to win the race, in the top group, followed pretty closely by Yermie Cohen and Joe Roy-Mayhew. Also in the top 25 were Trevor Rundell, Brian Jacokes, Gihan Amarasiriwardena and Hemagiri Arumugam. 
    
    
      
    
    Just after the three mile mark Ruzevick was pushed down from behind and in his attempt to get up he was pushed back down two more times and stepped on. Eventually he got up after losing 30 or so places. Cohen's hamstrings were cramping up, causing him to lose places fast. Roy-Mayhew worked his way to the lead by the four mile mark and Ruzevick was back in the top 15. What was a seven second delta one through seven at the two mile mark was now :31 seconds for one through five at the four mile mark. MIT was still in pretty good position for third or fourth place but was unable to hold their position in the final mile of the race. Seventeen runners passed Roy-Mayhew and his teammates, putting 20 seconds between the winner and the first MIT runner. The team delta was still a very good 32 seconds with the top five running 25:25 to 25:47, but with Roy-Mayhew at 18th place, Ruzevick at 20th, Rundell 34th, Arumugam 43rd and Cohen 48th out of the 330 runners the point total was just a little too high for such a competitive region. 
    
    
      
    
    Going into championship week the women's team was showing the wear and tear of the season. Maria Monks was fatigued and needed to take a few days off to recover. Jennifer Doyle was dealing with a possible stress fracture and also had to miss a few days and two hard workouts. A couple of others were having a difficult time finding their confidence. However, nothing was keeping Elizabeth Finn from setting her sights high for the 6000 meter race. Similarly to the men, the women got out very well at the start. At the mile mark Monks was in sixth place with Finn close behing and freshman, Katy Gordon, in 15th position. Doyle, Adrienne Bolger, Liz Labuz and Jacqui Wentz were together but a little far back at 5:57 for the mile, about eight seconds behind Gordon. Unlike the slow pace for the men, the leading women took the pace out hard, stringing the field out. 
    
    
      
    
    By two miles, MIT was in trouble. Monks had fallen back to 16th place and Finn had lost a couple of places as well but had come to within three seconds of Monks. Gordon lost 10 more seconds to Finn, and Bolger, Labuz, Doyle and Wentz lost 25 just in that mile. The final mile and three quarters was more of the same. Finn fought hard and stayed in 20th position, earning the final individual spot for the NCAA Division III Championship next weekend at St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN. Monks, feeling the fatigue that affected her the past couple of weeks, fell to 38th. Gordon placed 54th, Doyle managed the pain to finish 82nd and Bolger 90th out of the 344 racers to close out the scoring for MIT. The 1:13 delta was the worst for MIT for the season, probably a combination of Finn's great run and the problems affecting others in the top five.
    
    
      
    
    There are no seniors among the top 12 runners for the women's team, so there is hope the team will be back and much improved next year. With some of the top recruits possibly joining the team for next year MIT should continue to improve and be among those fighting to qualify for the NCAA Championship.

    **MONKS LEADS WOMEN TO 6TH PLACE FINISH**
    
    
      
    
    **SUB-VARSITY MEN DOMINATE DIVISION III FIELD**
    
    
      
    
    October 7, 2007
    
    
      
    
    On a humid, 80+ degree day with dust and dirt filling the lungs, mouth and nose of every runner due to a lack of rain over the past month, Maria Monks led the women to a remarkable sixth place finish among the 44 teams in the All Division New England (NEICAAA) Championship held at Franklin Park. This was the highest finish ever for the women's team, placing them third among Division III teams and beating most of the Division I teams in the region including their Ivy League rivals and all Division II teams.
    
    
      
    
    With the conditions being what they were, the MIT harriers were supposed to get out hard but settle into position and work their way up in the field. Monks got out strong and slowly worked her way to 17th position by the 2nd mile. Behind her were fellow sophomore Jacqui Wentz who continued to press the pace. Jennifer Doyle, Elizabeth Finn, Katy Gordon and Liz Labuz were working well as a group and moving up towards Wentz. By the end of the third mile of the 5K race, Monks had started to dehydrate and was having trouble holding her place, eventually falling back to 23rd in 18:56. Doyle caught Wentz at three miles but got outkicked at the finish, although the officials messed up the chute, placing Doyle just ahead of Wentz in 49th place, running 19:23 and 19:24 respectively. Finn had a great race, moving up to 64th place in 19:35. Gordon dropped out in the second mile with a severe quad cramp but Liz Labuz stepped up and held strong through the final mile and a half to round out MIT's scoring with a 20:02 for 101st place. 
    
    
      
    
    Even though they finished third among Division III teams, the MIT runners know nationally ranked Middlebury, Keene State and Bowdoin as well as some other teams that finished behind them are better than they showed today. The battle to be one of the top teams in the region with a chance to go to the NCAA Division III Championship in five weeks is a long way from over. 
    
    
      
    
    The men ran the middle part of the first mile too hard and paid the price. However, many other teams also had difficultly with the fast pace and difficult positions. Overall, MIT placed 12th and fourth among Division III teams. Losing places throughout the final four miles and having number one runner, Jake Ruzevick, drop out due to the effects of a lingering illness that caused him to feel sick and dizzy despite his best effort, had the effect of making the very respectable team finish seem tainted. 
    
    
      
    
    Yermie Cohen showed everyone that he has successfully made the transition from outstanding track runner to outstanding cross country runner. Trailing Ruzevick through the mile, Cohen did not hesitate to pass his ailing teammate, working his way up into the top 25 by the third mile. It was not until the final mile that Cohen lost some ground, finishing in 26:00 for 35th place. Thirty six seconds behind in 80th place was Brian Jacokes, running a solid race but one of those suffering from a fast start. Joe Roy-Mayhew was only three places back in 26:40. Running a very solid race, Chris Bruce, placed 95th in 26:45. Trevor Rundell rounded out the scoring for MIT, finishing 117th in 27:07.
    
    
      
    
    The encouraging part of the men's races is that the MIT sub-varsity team placed third in their race, behind two Division I teams. Their closest Division III competitor was Williams College in sixth place, 86 points behind. Even more impressive is that the first five for MIT were four freshmen and one sophomore. Gihan Amarasiriwardena led the way with an eighth place finish in 26:12, which would have been good enough for 50th place in the varsity race. Jack Bourbonnais, the one sophomore in the mix was 12th in 26:33. Kevin Kleinguetl was only 10 seconds back in 16th place. Finishing up the scoring were Paul Welle in 26th and Richard Prevost in 27th, running 26:57 and 26:58 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    The sub-varsity team would have finished 14th in the varsity race. Being able to place two teams in the top 15 of 43 teams in all of New England says a lot about the years to come for MIT. All together, MIT had nine runners in under a minute delta. The depth of the team, combined with a healthy Ruzevick should put the team in a strong position to contend for a national birth come November.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, both teams travel to Williams College to race shorter distances (4K for women and 6K for men) in the Plansky Invitational.

    October 27, 2007
    
    
      
    
    It was raining, the course was muddy, but nothing could slow down the MIT harriers. Both the women and  men ran to victory at the NEWMAC Conference Championship hosted by Smith College, giving the men their 10th championship in as many years. MIT is the only team to have ever won the men's championship. The women scored 50 points, 22 points more than their closest opponent, Wheaton College. The men recorded 18 points in their effort, defeating the next closest team, The Coast Guard Academy, by 34 points.
    
    
      
    
    In the women's race, Maria Monks did not get out with the leaders, spent the next three miles trying to make it up but was nine seconds back of two Smith College runners, Nora Youngs and Anna Cressotti, by the mile mark at 6:06. They were followed five seconds back by two Springfield runners, two Wheaton runners and one from Wellesley and Clark. MIT's pack of Liz Labuz, Elizabeth Finn, Katy Gordon and Adrienne Bolger were 16 seconds back of Monks in 12th - 15th place. Jacqui Wentz and Jennifer Doyle were in 19th and 20th place respectively for MIT.
    
    
      
    
    By the two mile mark, Youngs remained nine seconds ahead of Monks, but Cressotti had dropped back with her. Finn moved up to eighth while Gordon, Bolger and Labuz were 11th, 14th and 16th respectively. Wentz and Doyle dropped back four places each but looked pretty strong. However, both Wheaton and Wellesley had their strong runners in the lead group and their trail runners just behind Wentz and Doyle.
    
    
      
    
    At the finish, Wheaton placed second and third, just in front of Monks and Finn and then another runner in ninth. Fortunately, Doyle, Gordon and Bolger closed in 12th, 14th and 15th respectively to win it for MIT, giving the team a 28 second delta. Wellesley was never able to close, only putting one runner in front of MIT's top five. For her efforts, Gordon was named Rookie of the Year as the top freshman in the race. This was MIT's third NEWMAC title, last winning in 2003.
    
    
      
    
    In the men's race, Jake Ruzevick and Yermie Cohen took the lead early and led the pace at the mile in 5:17. Coast Guard had four runners and WPI three runners in front of MIT's next runners, who were 11 seconds back. Both teams had three more ahead of MIT's sixth runner, making it a very even first mile.
    
    
      
    
    At mile two, Ruzevick had broken away by a small amount with Cohen trailing in third, five seconds behind a runner from Springfield. One runner from Coast Guard and WPI were ahead of MIT's third through seventh runners; Brian Jacokes, Jack Bourbonnais, Trevor Rundell, Joe Roy-Mayhew and Chris Bruce. Trying to catch this group were MIT runners Gihan Amarasiriwardena, Hemu Arumugam and Paul Welle, all within seven seconds of MIT's pack.
    
    
      
    
    By mile three the race was put away as both trail groups merged and the Springfield runner fell out of contention. By the finish, Ruzevick ran away with a 23 second victory, earning NEWMAC Runner of the Year. Cohen pulled back to second. Following a single Coast Guard runner, MIT packed in the next five runners; Roy-Mayhew, Arumugam, Bourbonnais, Rundell and Jacokes. One more Coast Guard runner broke up MIT's dominance but was closely followed by NEWMAC Rookie of the Year, Amarasiriwardena, Welle and Bruce to give MIT 10 of the top 12 runners and a 56 second delta through those 10 runners. 
    
    
      
    
    MIT's next race is in two weeks at the NCAA Division III Regional Qualifier at Harkness Memorial State Park in Waterford, CT. The top two teams automatically move on to the NCAA Division III Championships the following weekend at the St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN.

    On the first competitive day of the season that felt like a fall cross country day, the MIT harriers traveled to Williams College to race in the Plansky Invitational. Tech handed Williams the defeat, outscoring them 34 to 41 with Tufts third in the eight team field with 81 points. 
    
    
      
    
    With Williams men's team being the number one team in New England, 14th ranked in the country and on their home course, the task of defeating them might seem a little far fetched. However, MIT thinks of themselves as a little better than the poll takers and thought they would be up to the task. Racing everyone but number four runner, Brian Jacokes, MIT felt they had a reasonable chance to run down the talented and deep Ephs and set out to do it at the start of the race. 
    
    
      
    
    MIT hoped for a conservative start, preferring to allow Williams to set the pace and to respect the rolling hills in the third mile of the 6K course. However, no one wanted the lead, much less set a fast pace. The Engineers, led by Jake Ruzevick and Yermie Cohen, were prepared to take the lead if they had to and did so, but at a pedestrian pace of 5:27 for the first mile. They were closely followed by a group of Williams and Tufts runners and couple of RPI runners and the aptly named "peloton" second group from MIT. Things sped up considerably in the second mile as more Williams runners moved up within MIT's chase group and many Tufts runners started losing places in the pack. Edgar Kosgey of Williams had moved into the lead but most places among the top runners did not change. Coming down some of hills and making some of the sharp turns on the third mile it was obvious Williams was more familiar with the course than MIT. Nevertheless, Tech runners asserted themselves in the final mile. Ruzevick tried to break Kosgey but was caught after the big downhill. Kosgey pulled away in the final 400, showing superior speed to Ruzevick. Cohen held on for second and Joe Roy-Mayhew outkicked his opponents to give MIT fourth place as well. Tufts and Williams put in the next seven runners with Tufts having four and Williams three. However, MIT finished with the next three runners, only 21 seconds behind Ruzevick to close out the victory.
    
    
      
    
    Of the first 29 finishers, 13 were MIT runners, 12 from Williams, and four from Tufts. The NCAA regional qualifier is in four weeks and it will be interesting to see where these teams are at that time.
    
    
      
    
    The plan for the women was the same as for the men, but the lack of experience combined by their own excitement led to the MIT women going out too hard in the first mile of the race. Williams took advantage of this and ran them down in the last mile of the race to win the 4K 18 to 41. 
    
    
      
    
    Williams took their usual conservative start and instead of being content to lead casually through the first mile, MIT took the pace out very hard led by Maria Monks going out in 5:41 at the mile. Monks had a 10 second lead at this point, but Williams had already caught the rest of the MIT runners and held a slight edge with their top five runners versus MIT's top five runners. By the two mile mark, Monks lead had shrunk to three seconds and Williams held the next five positions. At the finish two Williams runners caught Monks, winning in 14:52 and 14:54 respectively compared to 15:00 for Monks. The next four Williams runners were between 15:11 and 15:15, showing their strength. MIT held the next six places with Elizabeth Finn (15:22), Jacqui Wentz (15:27), Liz Labuz (15:35), Jennifer Doyle (15:40), Alina Gatowski (15:46) and Katy Gordon (15:48) getting the job done.
    
    
      
    
    Williams, the 5th ranked team in the country, showed their superiority but MIT going out so hard and setting themselves up did not help matters. "I was not happy with the speed they used to start the race, but I was very pleased with how they did not back off once they were committed to the pace," said MIT coach, Halston Taylor.
    
    
      
    
    Like the men, the next race for women is the NEWMAC Conference Championship hosted by Smith College on 11/27. The men have won the meet each of the nine championships since the inception of the conference. The women won it in 2001 and 2003, but look to add to that total this year.

    **HARRIERS CONTINUE UNDEFEATED WAYS WITH SMITH COLLEGE INVITATIONAL VICTORIES**

    Despite the upper 80 degree temperatures and extreme humidity, the Men's and Women's Cross Country teams exercised caution as well as their bodies to come away with victories in the Smith College Invitational. The women came from behind to win with a score of 37 points led by the 1-2 finish of Nicole Bucala and Maria Monks, crossing the line in a virtual tie. Wellesley College followed with 80 points, Connecticut College with 94, RPI with 107, host Smith College with 127, Coast Guard with 145, Mount Holyoke with 212, Clark with 230, WPI with 247, Babson with 272, Lesley with 325 and Lasell with 338. Jake Ruzevick led the men to victory with 26 points, Coast Guard with 35 points, WPI with 89, RPI with 94, UMass Dartmouth with 149, Clark with 184, Lasell with 220 and Babson College with 221.
    
    
      
    
    The women started things off with Monks and Bucala leading the race from the first turn, coming through the mile at 6:11, an ambitious pace given the heat index. The rest of the MIT pack was well off the pace, coming through the mile in 6:40. Wellesley, Smith, Coast Guard and RPI teams were all just off the leaders, well ahead of MIT's trail pack. By mile two, Jacqui Wentz, Katy Gordon and Elizabeth Finn had made up significant ground on the other teams, taking a small lead. In the third mile, Jennifer Doyle made up ground, passing Finn and nearly catching Gordon who was slowing down due to dehydration and severe blisters. When all was said and done, Wentz had moved up to ninth place, Gordon 12th, Doyle 13th, Finn 14th and Elizabeth Ohrt 16th to easily outscore the competition.
    
    
      
    
    On the men's side of the ledger, Ruzevick and Yermie Cohen were content to stay behind the leaders through the first mile but did not count on a 5:38 first mile. MIT, resting their 3-8 runners, relied on the third group to win the meet for the team. Unaccustomed to being counted on so heavily, the group settled in too far back, allowing at least 80 runners to get ahead by the mile mark, which was 5:59 at that part of the pack. Mile two and three were entirely different stories as a combination of the front runners slowing down and MIT's back group speeding up the gap closed significantly. At the end of four miles Ruzevick had taken control of the race, but Cohen, experiencing stomach problems, was falling back, although still in second place. Coast Guard was just ahead of MIT at each position three through six. Mile five sealed the deal for Tech as MIT runners continued to move up and the others continued to fade. Ruzevick won easily in 26:58 while Cohen faded to third. Paul Welle moved up to sixth, Hemagiri Arumugam seventh and Bill Phipps ninth to round out the scoring runners.
    
    
      
    
    Next week MIT travels to St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota to race on the NCAA Championship course in the St. Olaf Invitational. Both the men and women will run their top eight runners for the first time this season.

    **MEN AND WOMEN HAVE GOOD SHOWING AT ST. OLAF INVITATIONAL**
    
    
      
    
     
    
    
      
    
    September 15, 2007
    
    
      
    
    With near perfect weather at the St. Olaf Invitational, hosted by St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, the site of the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship in November the men's and women's teams from MIT held their own in their respective races, the women tieing for eighth with 220 points and the men placing sixth with a 153. The women's race had 25 teams and 369 finishers while the men had 27 teams and 350 runners completed the race.
    
    
      
    
    The women got out strong off the line, successfully avoiding getting trapped behind the horde of runners. Maria Monks, suffering from a pretty bad cold, decided she could race and did not hesitate in getting right up with the leaders. She came through the first mile in 5:47 while the rest of the team was between 6:02 and 6:11. Number one runner last week, Nicole Bucala, did not make the trip, so someone in the second group needed to step-up. Hearing the first mile split did not have the desired effect, instead the women thought they went out too fast and backed off. As Monks began to feel the effects of her cold, the main group of MIT runners began to maintain the gap. After the three mile mark, Monks had very little kick left while Jacqui Wentz had plenty left, making up 14 seconds in the final seven tenths of a mile of the 6,000 meter course. Monks finished in 23: 38 for 22nd place while Wentz completed the 6K in 23:56 for 32nd place. Completing the top five for the Engineers were Katy Gordon in 24:13 (49th), Liz Labuz in 24:19 (58th) and Alina Gatowski in 24:22 (62nd).
    
    
      
    
    The men were able to run with their top eight although a couple of them also had colds. Also getting off the line well, the runners from Tech established themselves well at the first mile. Jake Ruzevick and Yermie Cohen, who was the most under the weather, led the group with a 5:02 split while the next six were bunched between 5:07 and 5:08. Not fearing the split they forged ahead, nearly even splitting the next three miles despite the fourth mile being almost entirely uphill. Ruzevick established himself in the top 20 and stayed there the entire race, finishing in 18th place in 26:11. Joe Roy-Mayhew caught up with Cohen by mile four and pulled ahead, finishing in 26:26, good for 25th place. Cohen was right behind in 26:37, remarkable given the way he was feeling. Trevor Rundell and Brian Jacokes ran together for the first four miles, pushing each other to a strong finish, with Rundell in 26:38 (34th) and Jacokes in 26:46 (47th). The 35 second delta through the top five was a strong showing for the Engineeers, allowing them to place within 21 points of ninth ranked Allegheny College.
    
    
      
    
    Both teams know they can improve and hope to make some of that happen at next week's meet at the Connecticut College Invitational, a very flat course at Harkness Park. MIT may hold out a couple of their top runners but the core should be able to shine at the fast course.
