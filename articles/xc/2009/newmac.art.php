The women had won the past two NEWMAC Championships, dominating a little more the second year. Neither team was planning on relinquishing their hold on the championship trophies and neither did. The men won with a score of 24 points to runner-up Springfield's 41. The women took no prisoners, taking the race from the start and finishing with a total of 18 points, a meet record. </p>                  <p align="left">Both the men and women were looking for fast times since it was their final time on the Franklin Park course in 2009. However, the wet month of October combined with the high number of races on the course and not enough warm days, left a very wet and mushy course that gave the runners nothing in return. In addition the 75 degree temperatures and 40 mph winds meant a day to race and disregard time.</p>                  <p align="left">The men raced first, and predictably, the first mile was slow as Hemu Arumugam '10, Kyle Hannon '13, and Brian Fuller of Springfield came through in 5:01. MIT had a tight pack right behind, between 5:03-5:06, with the rest of the field trailing. </p>                  <p align="left">By the second mile, Fuller had taken a small lead. The MIT pack had spread out and the Springfield runners had started to catch up a bit. In the third mile Hannon had started vomiting and was obviously falling back. Arumugam and Fuller now had an 18 second lead over Bill Phipps '10 and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11. The second Springfield runner was nine seconds back with Paul Welle '11. The next Springfield runner was 16 seconds back, behind four more MIT runners and two Coast Guard runners.</p>                  <p align="left"> During the Wilderness Loop in the fourth mile, Arumugam put on a big surge to open up an eight second lead. Phipps was still in third, 23 seconds back with Amarasiriwardena within three seconds of his teammate. However, Springfield's second runner was now only seven seconds down and their third runner had passed five runners to move into seventh place. Hannon was falling back fast and Welle had also begun to fade. Fortunately for MIT, Springfield's fourth and fifth runners were back in 14th and 21st place. </p>                  <p align="left">The final mile continued the trend of the top Springfield runners moving up. Arumugam won in 25:50, 11 seconds ahead of Fuller. The number two Springfield runner passed Amarasiriwardena and their third runner passed Dan Harper '12, for sixth. All of the top six Springfield runners are underclassmen while MIT loses their top two. This should give the MIT runners something to think about for next year. </p>                  <p align="left">The Tech women were supposed to go out hard and simply run away with the race. After watching the men struggle with that philosophy, the women decided to back off the pace just a little. The first mile was a more reasonable 5:47. In that lead group were Jacqui Wentz '10, Maria Monks '10, Alina Gatowski '11 and Amanda DiPaolo from Springfield. Behind them were one runner from Smith and one from Wellesley. Five seconds behind MIT's A group was the B group of Brooke Johnson '13, Missy Showers '13, Tania Morimoto '12, Katherine Eve '12, Katy Gordon '11 and Marie Burkland '13.</p>                  <p align="left">In the second mile, Monks pushed the pace, surprising Wentz, and opening up an eight second lead on Wentz. DiPaolo was 15 seconds behind Wentz. Gatowksi, still recovering from a cold earlier in the week, fell way back. Morimoto pushed the second mile  and was only three seconds back of DiPaolo. Showers, Gatowski and Johnson were seven seconds behind Morimoto when they should have been with her. Burkland dropped out due to an anterior tibialis injury and Gordon, who was not able to handle the pace, had fallen back with the failing Wellesley and Smith runners. </p>                  <p align="left">The final eleven tenths had Monks pulling off a 13 second victory over Wentz in 18:32, an excellent performance given the conditions. DiPaolo finished 24 seconds behind Wentz. MIT then brought in the next four runners led by Johnson in 19:20. Following were Showers, Morimoto and Gatowski. Similar to the guys, MIT graduates its top two runners, but along with the rest of the young team that put 10 runners ahead of second place Wellesley's fifth runner, MIT has a stable of very good freshmen who were taken out of the season early to make sure their pre existing injuries have plenty of time to heal. MIT hopes to be even stronger next year. </p>                  <p align="left">In two weeks the Engineers travel to the Twin Brooks Cross Country course in Cumberland, ME for the NCAA New England Regional Championship. The top two teams receive automatic advancement to the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championships hosted by Baldwin Wallace College in Cleveland, OH.</p>                  <p align="center"><a href="../xcsched.php">RETURN TO CROSS COUNTRY</a> </p>                </div>              </div></td>          </tr>          <tr>             <td>&nbsp;</td>            <td>&nbsp;</td>          </tr>        </table></td>    </tr>  </table> </body></html>
