The Engineers competed in the <a href="neicaaa.res.php">All Division New England (NEICAAA) Championship</a> at Franklin Park. Despite the slow times produced due to the rain soaked course and the high winds, MIT raced to the level of expectations, placing fourth overall and first among Division III teams.</p>                  <p align="left">Of the four races; men's and women's varsity (top 7) and sub-varsity, MIT placed in the top five in three of the four races, earning fifth in the women's sub-varsity race and a very nice fourth in the men's sub-varsity race. The only race that went horribly wrong for Tech was the men's varsity, suffering through the worst finish in the history of the program with a 29th place finish.</p>                  <p align="left">With over 300 runners in each of four races and 42 and 49 varsity teams in the men's and women's varsity races respectively, the key to success on the soft course with a sharp turn less than 300 meters into the race, was to get out. The three successful MIT teams accomplished this feat, the men's varsity did not.</p>                  <p align="left">In the women's varsity race, Maria Monks '10, led the way across the field, perhaps a little too fast, but she was very concerned about getting trapped in the back and was probably a little nervous, just having arrived at Franklin Park 25 minutes prior to her race due to having to take the GRE exam in the morning. The rest of the varsity got out well with the exception of Katherine Eve '12, who was not feeling well. Despite the soft ground, the first mile split was quite fast. Jacqui Wentz '10, and Monks were with the leaders in 5:32. Alina Gatowski '11, was a bit back in 48th place at the mile in 5:38. Brooke Johnson '13, out a little too quickly, was just two seconds back. Missy Showers '13, was back at about 85th position in 5:45 along with Tania Morimoto '12.</p>                  <p align="left">By the two mile mark, Wentz was in fourth, six seconds behind the two leaders, Cory Conner from University of Maine and Ari Garber from Brown, and a few feet behind Laura Brustolon of Southern Connecticut. Monks had fallen back to 14th with Gatowski in 42nd place. Showers had moved up to 66th place but Johnson fell back to 71st. In the final mile, Wentz had pulled away from Brustolon and was catching Garber but made her move too late to do so, finishing in 18:06, the fastest time ever for an MIT runner at Franklin Park. Monks dropped back to 20th place in 18:24, a Franklin Park personal best. Gatowski only dropped five more places but could have easily been up with Monks if she had more experience in these races. Showers moved up a couple of spots to secure 63rd place in 19:01. Johnson never really regained her focus, ending up in 19:17 in 84th place. This gave MIT a total of 217 points, only 16 points behind Dartmouth, and only 25 points ahead of rival Williams College in seventh place. The women have achieved a great accomplishment but there is still work to do.</p>                  <p align="left">The men's varsity race could not have been more different than the women's, at least not as far as MIT was concerned. The Engineers did not get out well, poorly managing the start and getting squeezed from both sides, ending up behind over 150 runners after the first 300 meters. Bill Phipps '10, was the first MIT runner to pass through the mile mark and he was back in 80th place at 4:53. Hemu Arumugam '10, Dawit Zewdie '13, and Kyle Hannon '13, were back around 120th in 4:57. Dan Harper '12, Ben Mattocks '12, and Jacob Young '13, were even further back at around 150th in 5:01. Clearly they were already out of the race. </p>                  <p align="left">Mile two saw some improvement with Arumugam and Hannon catching up to Phipps, with all of them moving up in the mid 70s. Zewdie was now in 89th position but still looking pretty good. Harper had not moved, still around 146th place. Mattocks and Young actually lost ground to 160th and 206th places respectively.</p>                  <p align="left">Mile three may be the most unfortunate cross country mile ever experienced by an MIT squad. First, Young, already suffering a poor race, lost his shoe at around two and a half miles. Then coming down Bear Cage Hill, just before the three mile mark, Phipps falls down and decides to quit the race. Hannon strains his hamstring, falling four times and unable to run without limping. With only four runners remaining plus Young with one shoe and falling back, Tech was not looking at a very rosy picture. Arumugam continued to move up while Zewdie began to move back. Harper was moving up slightly and Mattocks was holding steady while Young continued to fall back. The end result was Arumugam finishing in 44th place in 25:40. Zewdie held on for 105th, Harper 127th, Mattocks 157th and Young back in 248th place. </p>                  <p align="left">In the sub-varsity races, MIT competed pretty well. Marie Burkland '13 and Katy Gordon '11, led the way for the women. Burkland competed very well, finishing in 16th place with a 19:21. Gordon ran well but could have run with Burkland had she not gone out so fast and focused a bit better. As it was she finished in 22nd place with a 19:30. Alicia Kaestli '12, ran 19:42 for 28th place, Lauren Allen '13, ran 20:02 for 44th place while Maggie Lloyd '12, rounded out the top five with a 20:07 for 48th place and a well earned fifth place as a team. Only Williams College finished ahead of MIT among Division III teams.</p>                  <p align="left">Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, led the way for MIT in the men's sub-varsity race. Amarasiriwardena was up with the leaders from the start, running in 15th place at the mile mark and finishing in eighth with a 26:26 time. Stephen Serene '12, a much improved sophomore, stayed in around the mid 20s for position, finishing in 26th place. Paul Welle '11, unable to duplicate his former performances, went out the fastest of all MIT runners, going through the half mile in 2:23 and the mile in 4:52. However, this must have been too fast for Welle on this day as he progressively slowed as the race proceeded, although he held onto 32nd place. Rounding out the top five were Logan Trimble '13, and Richard Prevost '11, in 43rd and 47th place with times of 27:04 and 27:06 respectively. The fourth place as a team was a nice performance. Again, only Williams among Division III teams finished ahead of MIT. </p>                  <p align="left">MIT seemed a little beat up on the men's side while racing very well on the women's side. Three weeks remains before the NEWMAC Conference Championship and five weeks before the NCAA Regional qualifier. There is plenty of time for both teams to be at their best when it really counts.</p>                  <p align="center"><a href="../xcsched.php">RETURN TO CROSS COUNTRY</a> </p>              </div>              </div></td>          </tr>          <tr>             <td>&nbsp;</td>            <td>&nbsp;</td>          </tr>        </table></td>    </tr>  </table> </body></html>
