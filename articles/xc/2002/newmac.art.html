  <p><b><font size="+3">MIT RACES TO NEWMAC TITLE</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="+3">Placing 6 in First 10 Gives Engineers 5th Consecutive 
    Title</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">November 2, 2002</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">In what turned out to be basically a dual meet, 
    MIT ran past Coast Guard to remain the only team to ever win the New England 
    Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Men's Cross Country Championship 
    with their 5th consecutive win. MIT placed 6 of their runners in the top 10 
    to score 25 points to Coast Guard's 38. In a close battle for 3rd, Babson 
    College outpointed Wheaton, WPI and Springfield 114 to 120 to 122 for both 
    WPI and Springfield. Clark brought up the rear with 220 points.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">With a plan to go out hard on the 5.1 mile, 
    hilly course, Sean Nolan and Ben Schmeckpeper took the lead and set a hard 
    pace on the slow course with a 4:52 first mile. As expected, the top Coast 
    Guard runners followed, but were soon strung out as they were not all able 
    to hold the pace. MIT's second group, starting out a little slower than expected, 
    nevertheless set to their task of picking off the tiring runners. By the 2 
    mile mark, the plan showed signs of success as MIT's second group has indeed 
    closed on Coast Guard's 3rd runner and had positioned 5 runners ahead of Coast 
    Guard's 4th.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Up front, Sean Nolan and Ben Schmeckpeper led 
    a determined Ian Bartonicek from Coast Guard over the many loops of the golf 
    course. Just before the 3 mile mark, Schmeckpeper began to fall off the fast 
    pace. For the next 1 1/2 miles Bartonicek was Nolan's shadow. Coming down 
    the final hill, Nolan opened up a lead that expanded to 4 seconds at the finish 
    line in 26:10.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">Schmeckpeper held on for 3rd, :22 ahead of Dowthit 
    of Coast Guard. Albert Liu showed he is determined to finish his career in 
    style as he finished in 5th ahead of a Babson College runner (the only non 
    MIT / Coast Guard runner in the top 11) he had never beaten. Freshman Eric 
    Khatchadourian ran the race of the year with a beautifully paced race to finish 
    7th overall. Carlos Renjifo finished 9th, just behind the 3rd Coast Guard 
    runner to close out MIT's top 5. Brian Anderson also finished in the top 10, 
    just behind Renjifo.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+1">MIT is still hoping to return #3 runner, freshman 
    Steve Maltas to action in time for the NCAA Regional Qualifier on 11/16. In 
    case Maltas does not make it back from his lower back injury, the supporting 
    members of the MIT harriers seem to be determined to get the job done regardless. 
    With 4 spots allotted for advancement to Nationals from the New England Region 
    and with dominant teams like Keene State, Bowdoin and Williams almost assured 
    of one of the four spots, teams like Bates, Tufts, Trinity, Connecticut College 
    and MIT will see who wants it the most on race day.</font></p>
