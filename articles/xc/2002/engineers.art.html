SWEEP</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>September 14, 2002</P>

<P>The dog days of September slowed the MIT men's cross country team
down a bit, but it could not prevent them from putting together a
near sweep over rival engineering schools, RPI and WPI. MIT's score
of 16 points was one point more than a perfect score as the men from
Cambridge placed 1,2,3,4, and 6 to outdistance RPI with 45 points and
WPI with 85.</P>

<P>Right from the gun, Sean Nolan and Ben Schmeckpeper took control
of the race, going through the first mile in 4:56 on the hot and
humid day. A lone RPI runner, Keith Weiss, was right with them and
his teammates were clustered close behind to give the impression they
were taking the race to MIT. The difficult second mile had its usual
effect of bringing opponents back to reality and placing MIT well
ahead of the visitors from Troy and Worcester.</P>

<P>By the end of the third mile, it was apparent the weather was
going to have an effect on the times as nearly all of the runners
began slowing. It was equally apparent that MIT was slowing down less
than RPI and WPI as freshman Steve Maltas moved into 3rd place and
Craig Wildman was about to move into 4th.</P>

<P>With Albert Liu not racing due to the lack of sleep he had been
missing as he finished his thesis, Brian Anderson knew he would have
to step up to help his teammates. At the end of mile four he had
moved up to the Weiss from RPI and Wildman. Apparently he had a
furious last mile as he finished :06 ahead of Weiss to move into 4th.
Weiss stayed tough and passed Wildman to prevent the sweep.</P>

<P>Giving support for MIT were Carlos Renjifo in 8th, David Gray in
9th, George Hanson in 10th, Fivos Constantinou in 11th and Eric
Khatchadourian in 12th, all within :35 of each other.</P>

<P>MIT was able to manage a 2:00 delta for runners 1-10, a
significant improvement from last week. Perhaps even more important
was the fact that the top 5 runners were only seperated by 1:06, and
this was without Liu.</P>

<P>Next week, the top 9 runners will make their way to St. Olaf
College in Northfield, MN to run in the St. Olaf Invitational and
take the opportunity to run on the national championship course. The
remaining runners will race in the UMass Dartmouth Invitational.</P>
