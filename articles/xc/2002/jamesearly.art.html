<P>October 19, 2002</P>

<P>On a day threatened by rain, but otherwise perfect for cross
country, MIT ran a less than aggressive race and could not catch the
Jumbos of Tufts University at the James Early Invitational at
Westfield State College. MIT ended up 2nd with 85 points in the 27
team field, behind Tufts 72 points.</P>

<P>A casual start, combined with passive middle miles, prevented MIT
from running their best race. In the first mile, Sean Nolan and Ben
Schmeckpeper let Chris Kapfer of the US Merchant Marine Academy get a
4 second lead, and never tried to close the gap. Without freshman
star Steve Maltas in the lineup, the Engineers depended on Albert
Liu, Brian Anderson, Carlos Renjifo and Craig Wildman to close the
usually large delta and run with the opponents 3rd, 4th and 5th
runners. While Tufts had five of their runners in front of MIT's 3rd
runner at the mile, it seemed the Engineers were close enough to
perform their usual magic and close the gap by the 4th mile.</P>

<P>Mile two showed improvement for the chase group but Tufts still
had a large advantage, as did Coast Guard. Nolan and Schmeckpeper
were waiting for each other to make a move, but neither did. Anderson
and Liu moved up in the field, as did Renjifo and Wildman. As they
entered the woods, not to be seen again until they were 600 meters
from the finish, it seemed that Tech was in control and should come
out ahead.</P>

<P>When they returned to the field for the finish, Nolan was in a
solid 2nd place, 4 seconds behind Kapfer. Schmeckpeper was in 4th, 6
seconds behind Nolan. Anderson did his job of closing the gap by
finishing 1:05 behind Nolan, and with Maltas in the lineup, it would
have been enough. But without him, there were not enough Engineers to
run with Tufts, who put 4 runners between MIT's 2nd and 3rd runners
and another between their 3rd and 4th. Coast Guard, missing their
number 1 runner, was not able to make up for their loss, finishing
3rd with 108 points.</P>

<P>MIT needs to a little better if they hope to defend their NEWMAC
Conference Championship on November 2. A healthy Coast Guard squad
will be too much to handle with this type of effort. The NEWMAC
Championship will be hosted by Wellesley College and run on the local
golf course.</P>
