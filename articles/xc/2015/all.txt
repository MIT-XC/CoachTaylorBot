    ### Varsity Looks Strong in Season Debut Against Alumni/ae
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                      
    
    September 4, 2015
    
    
                      
    
    The runners could not have asked for a better September day for the annual Varsity vs. Alumni/ae competition with temperatures in the low 70's, the humidity low and the sun shining. The athletes took advantage of the opportunity, running some very fast times as the varsity defeated the alums in both competitions. The men won 23 to 38 as Benji Xie '15 and Justin Bullock '14 broke up the MIT sweep with a fine second and third place finish respectively. The varsity women swept the first six places to win 15 to 49.
    
    
                      
    
    The NCAA Division III seventh ranked men raced first, running the 5K distance in this friendly competition. Matt Deyo '16 was supposed to take the pace out hard in 4:45 and that is exactly what he hit at the mile mark. Bullock was not too far behind, but Xie was back at 4:55, just making his way to the front of a mass of MIT runners. By the two mile mark, Deyo had slowed, but maintained a healthy lead. Xie and Bullock were working well together and had opened up a nice lead on the young MIT horde. Deyo was able to pull away enough to remove all doubt in the third mile, finishing the 5K in 15:35. Xie claimed second in 15:51 and Bullock earned third in 15:54. Ben Freed '18 closed ground significantly but it was too little, too late as he finished in 15:56. Josh Rosenkranz '19 was right behind Freed in 15:58. Nicholas Waltman '18 finished sixth in 16:02 and Alex Knapp '19 closed out the scoring for MIT in 16:04. The 29 second delta through five runners showed nice depth this early in the season but might take a hit at the 8K distance. Even better, the next four MIT runners, Aidan Gilson '19, Dennis Maloney '19, Daniel Weiss '19 and Rory Beyer '17 were all within 16 seconds of Knapp. Also placing for the Alumni were Roy Wedge '14 in 16:28, Allen Leung '15 in 18:03 as he comes back from a broken ankle, and Logan Trimble '13 in 18:18. Others competing for the Alumni were Eric Khatchadourian '06, Eric Safai '15 and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11.
    
    
                      
    
    The second ranked women took to the course for their 3K after the men. While the women had a similar plan, they did not follow it so well. Maryann Gong '17 along with Christina Wicker '17 were planning on taking the pace out in 5:35, but split up early as Gong went out in 5:29. Wicker was back at 5:32 along with Nicole Zeinstra who was supposed to be back at 5:40 to 5:45 with her group, but they got pulled by Zeinstra and were strung out between 5:32 and 5:37--far from displaying group running.
    
    
                      
    
    Fortunately they were only running 3,000 meters so the fast pace did not totally destroy the race. Gong won in 10:48 in what was actually more like 3,100 meters. Zeinstra was able to close well to finish second in 11:07, just one second ahead of Wicker. Anna Frederich '18 had a nice second half to finish fourth in 11:13 and Mary Eccles '18 was fifth in 11:16 to close out the sweep. Megan Montgomery '19, who went out exceptionally hard at the start, held on for sixth in 11:21. Louise van den Heuvel '14 was the top alum, finishing seventh in 11:34. Also placing for the Alumnae were Alexandra Taylor '14 in 12:20, Maggie Lloyd '12 in 13:03, Kaitlin Allen '14 in 13:45 and Stephanie Marzen '15 in 14:41.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT does not compete for three weeks when they will have their first intercollegiate competition in the Williams College Purple Valley Classic on September 26.

    Engineers Construct Victory at Conn. College Invite
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                      
    
    October 17, 2015
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's nationally ranked Men's and Women's Cross Country teams at 12th and 4th respectively, competed at the Connecticut College Invitational with three goals in mind. The first was to work on the mental side of competing with hopes of raising their level of performance. If successful, this should allow the Engineers to achieve their second goal of winning the competition. The third goal was to get a good feel for the course that will be the site of the NCAA Division III New England Region Championship. By all accounts all three goals were achieved by both genders. 
    
    
                      
    
    The women raced first on the sunny, but cool day with temperatures in the mid to upper 50's. Going into the 6K race, MIT was without number three runner Nicole Zeinstra '16, who was going through some stomach issues. Just before the race, Megan Montgomery '19 had a hamstring tighten up, so she was pulled just to be on the safe side. Those racing knew they would have to step up. Nationally ranked Tufts (3rd), Carleton (11th) and Oneonta (12th) were among the opposing teams so MIT would need to be at the top of their game.
    
    
                      
    
    After a successful start in the 25 team field, the women settled into the race plan. At the mile mark, Maryann Gong '17 was conservative at 5:36, but was in fourth place, about six seconds out of first. Her teammates were running conservatively, but were moving up in the field. At the two mile mark, Gong had lost some focus and slowed to 11:30. Christina Wicker '17 was four seconds back and Leandra Zimmermann '19 and Mary Eccles '18 were racing amazingly well, only three seconds behind Wicker. After going out too fast, Bailee Margolis '19 had fallen back with a 6:07 second mile. 
    
    
                      
    
    The third mile saw Gong lose more ground and slip from second to fourth place. Wicker was now only two seconds back at 17:25 and Zimmermann and Eccles were just four seconds behind Gong. Margolis had lost focus and lost 30 more seconds. Miraculously, Wicker coming up to Gong woke her up and Gong sprinted the final half mile to take the lead and win the race in 21:31. Wicker finished in seventh in 21:47. Zimmermann was 11th and Eccles 12th, both crossing the line at 21:54. Margolis ran a strong last 1000 to hold onto 32nd place in 22:43 and give MIT the victory with 62 points over Tufts at 67 points. Having an excellent race in terms of improvement and being well paced was Darby LaPlant, who finished 58th overall in 23:14. Keene State surprised many by getting third with 108 points, just ahead of fourth place of Carleton with 111 points and Oneonta in fifth with 119 points.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's men's team was starting to get their runners back to full health and they hoped to show off their depth in this meet. Hart Horner of Carleton College took the lead at the start of the race, quickly turning the race into one for second place. One of those vying for that position was Colin Godwin '17, who has been getting closer to his All America form from last year week by week. Godwin came through the mile mark in fourth place in 4:54. Just behind him was freshman Daniel Weiss, who had made a spurt to move up into the chase group. Back at 5:00 was Dennis Maloney '19, Rory Beyer '17, and Ben Freed '18. Most of the remainder of Tech's runners were back around 5:05-5:10, following the race plan.
    
    
                      
    
    Throughout the next two miles Godwin, Weiss, Maloney and Beyer either held ground or moved up slightly. Freed was struggling a bit in the third mile, but Cooper Sloan '18, still coming back from injury, was making a statement as he moved through the field, running with Freed and Alex Knoedler '18 at 15:29 at the end of mile three. The fourth mile can wear on a runner as the footing is not the best and it includes a slight climb in elevation. Godwin continued to gap himself from his teammates, now at :13 over Weiss -- 20:08 to 20:21. Sloan continued to move up, now only two seconds behind Beyer as MIT's fifth runner. For the finish, Godwin ran a 4:58 final mile to move into third place in 25:06. Weiss finished will in 5:02 to claim seventh place. Maloney finished just 28 seconds behind Godwin in 25:34 and Sloan out-leaned Beyer at the finish in 25:44 for 14th and 15th place. Racing well after taking a week off to rehab a minor lower leg injury, Nicholas Waltman '18 finished in 28th place as the Engineers seventh runner in 26:00. Tech finished with 49 points in the 26 team field, 46 points ahead of second place Connecticut College.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week MIT will not compete as they prepare for the NEWMAC Conference Championship on Sunday, November 1 at Franklin Park. The men have never lost the title and will be going for their 18th consecutive title. The women have won the past eight titles and hope to claim their ninth.

    Women Earn Third Place at Nationals, Men 19th
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                      
    
    November 21, 2015
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's Men's and Women's Cross Country teams earned the right to be one of the 32 teams selected per gender throughout the country to race at the NCAA Division III Championship, hosted by the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh at Lake Breeze Golf Course in Winneconne, WI. by virtue of their successful seasons. After a relatively poor showing at last week's Regional Championship, both teams wanted redemption and the opportunity to show the country what they were capable of running.
    
    
                      
    
    While snow was predicted, the storm passed just south of the area, but the cold temperatures were certainly present at below freezing for most of the championship. The course was relatively dry and flat, making for reasonably fast times and the women would be testing the course first. MIT, ranked eighth going into the meet after finishing fourth at the Regional Championship, was barely holding on from a health standpoint. Four of the seven racing were facing injuries or illness that were severely affecting their ability to perform. 
    
    
                      
    
    With a pretty solid start, MIT runners were in the top third of the 280 runner field. Maryann Gong '17, one of the pre-race favorites to win the competition, was in a good position at 5:42 for the first mile, just two seconds out of the lead. Leandra Zimmermann '19, running on a foot she could not jog or walk on without limping all week, was back at 5:46. Christina Wicker '17 and Sarah Quinn '16 were both at 5:47, Mary Eccles '18 at 5:48, Nicole Zeinstra at 5:50 and Megan Montgomery '19 having a difficult time mentally back at 5:56.
    
    
                      
    
    During the second mile it was expected that Gong would move up to the front of the lead pack, but she stayed in the back, coming through in 11:39. The overall pace was slow as it seemed no one wanted to take the lead, normally a perfect setup for Gong. Zimmermann was racing tough and Wicker and Eccles were right with her at 11:42. However, Quinn's compartment syndrome affected calves were slowing her down and Zeinstra, who has been dealing with digestive issues all season, was not fairing well, putting them both back at  the 90's position wise and moving in the wrong direction at 11:49. Montgomery was already out of the race mentally.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final 1.73 miles, Gong slid further back when the leaders made a break, but woke up a bit in the final 400 meters to pass about 14 runners, finishing 16th overall in 21:38. Zimmermann, Wicker and Eccles got the job done, placing 45th, 48th and 60th respectively in 21:52, 21:55 and 22:02. Zeinstra slid back another 13 spots, but held onto 107th place in 22:24. MIT's total points at 276 was pretty high, but the team score would be the actual place minus those individuals not on teams.
    
    
                      
    
    Williams College ran a superb race, taking the team title with 81 points. No other team was close. Geneseo State was second with 179 points, MIT third at 182 points, pre-race favorite Johns Hopkins fourth at 188 and Washington University fifth at 193 points. While the women from MIT knew they could have easily finished second as a team, they could also have been fifth if any one of their top five runners had given up.
    
    
                      
    
    The men were next, and while Matt Deyo '16 was running with a broken bone in his foot, everyone else was finally healthy and expecting big things. That all changed about 300 meters into the race when a runner battling another runner went down in the packed field. Approximately 50 runners proceeded to go down on top of one another. Three of those runners were from MIT and two of them were spiked pretty badly. By the time Alex Knoedler '18, Josh Rosenkranz '19 and Daniel Weiss '19 got up, they were among the final 10 runners since they had been at the bottom of the pile.
    
    
                      
    
    In the first two miles, Rory Beyer '17 and Colin Godwin '17 were running around 30th place, looking strong, splitting 9:55. Deyo was dealing with the pain in his foot, but it was obviously slowing him down. After getting up to 68th place at one point, the senior began to slide back, splitting 10:05 at two miles. Cooper Sloan '18 was at 10:15 and Rosenkranz had moved up well to come through at 10:16. Knoedler was showing great patience as he was steadily moving up.
    
    
                      
    
    Both Beyer and Godwin lost about 15 places in the final two miles, finishing in 48th and 54th place in 25:10 and 25:13 respectively. However, the remainder of MIT's runners were not so successful. Deyo finished in 159th in 25:50, Sloan in 172nd in 25:54, and Knoedler 183rd in 25:58 to close out the scoring. 
    
    
                      
    
    It was unfortunate the final race of a pretty successful season had to end with three runners falling and another choosing to race on a broken foot. Finishing 19th was a disappointment for the Engineers, but they may not be losing anyone for next year. Deyo has another year of eligibility, and if he goes to MIT for graduate school he will be able to race next season. 
    
    
                      
    
    On the women's side, only Zeinstra will not return, giving the Tech ladies a solid foundation for the 2016 season.

    Women First and Men Second Among DIII Teams
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                      
    
    October 10, 2015
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's Women's Cross Country team, ranked fourth in the country for Division III, finished as the top Division III team in the NEICAAA Championship, a meet that pits all of the colleges in New England against each other, Division I, II and III. The men, ranked 13th in the country for Division III, were the second Division III team in the meet.
    
    
                      
    
    On a very sunny, 65 degree day, the Engineers entered the meet determined to improve on their relatively poor race results from two weeks ago at the Purple Valley Classic.  Working against this goal for the men was the fact that it was confirmed that All America runner Matt Deyo '16 has a stress fracture and will miss at least two more weeks, and Nicholas Waltman '18, currently the team's number three runner would have to miss the meet with an irritated calf. As it is, All America runner Colin Godwin '17 is only in his fifth week of running after a long term injury from last Spring and Rory Beyer '17 would be running his first race after injury, competing in the sub-varsity race. Fortunately, the injury plagued harriers have some very talented freshmen and sophomores determined to get the job done.
    
    
                      
    
    Joining Godwin in the varsity race were Dennis Maloney '19, Daniel Weiss '19, Ben Freed '18, Alex Knoedler '18 and Alex Knapp '19. The entire race started off at a pedestrian pace for the top runners, as the leaders were only clocked at 4:40 at the mile mark. Maloney, Weiss, Godwin and Freed came through at 4:48, looking very strong and together. Knoedler was back at 4:55, but hoped  to make his way up to his teammates. 
    
    
                      
    
    The second mile runs a bit slow due to Bear Cage Hill, but it was obvious MIT was not nearly aggressive enough as they slowed to 5:18 pace for Maloney and Weiss with Godwin two seconds back and Freed two seconds behind  Godwin. Knoedler was nine more seconds back, so it did not appear he was going to catch up to his teammates.. 
    
    
                      
    
    Mile three brought more of the same as the runners worked their way through the winding Wilderness Loop. The inexperienced MIT runners were not pushing the pace. It seemed they were settled in a bit too much. In the fourth mile, the pace picked up and Maloney broke away from Weiss with a 5:08 mile. Weiss also picked up the pace with a 5:14 effort. Godwin and Freed increased their effort but still lost ground to the freshmen. Knoedler was moving up in the field, but also losing ground to his teammates.
    
    
                      
    
    The final mile, which is a little short, saw Maloney finish with a 4:52, Weiss with a 4:51 and Godwin with a 4:52 to finish 29th (25:23), 38th (25:28) and 56th (25:38) respectively--excellent times for this early in the season. Maloney and Weiss were the third and fifth freshmen in the entire race and the top two DIII freshmen. Freed was 70th in 25:47 and Knoedler 98th in 26:03. The Engineers finished ninth overall out of 39 teams. 
    
    
                      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, David Walter '18 had a breakout performance, finishing third overall  in 25:52. Beyer ran an outstanding race given he has only had one workout, finishing 10th in 26:03.
    
    
                      
    
    While it is not wise to speculate, if Deyo gets back and Godwin returns to last year's dominance, MIT would  finished second overall in a race against the same teams.
    
    
                      
    
    The women have been going through some of their own difficulties as All America runner Sarah Quinn '16 has not been able to race due to chronic calf problems. Added to that, Nicole Zeinstra '16 has been having a stomach illness that has prevented her from racing her best. The women too would be depending on relatively inexperienced runners to step up.
    
    
                      
    
    Maryann Gong '17, still trying to figure out how to reach her potential, ran a very intelligent, well paced first mile in 5:31, which was right on plan. Christina Wicker '17 and Zeinstra were right with her, which may not have been the best idea for Zeinstra. Megan Montgomery '19, Mary Eccles '18 and Leandra Zimmerman '19 were back a bit between 5:38 and 5:43.
    
    
                      
    
    The women were even less aggressive on the second mile than the men. Gong should have moved up into the top ten in the race but instead, lost focus and slowed to a 6:03. Wicker followed suit, slowing to a 6:06. Zeinstra's stomach went south in a hurry, causing her to slow to a 6:15. Montgomery slowed to 6:18, Eccles to 6:16 as they came back to Zimmerman, bringing them all through in 11:55. 
    
    
                      
    
    It is apparent the women are not comfortable with discomfort as they continued to slow through the third mile and the 5K finish. Only Gong woke up, running a 5:53 to move her to 11th place at the finish in 18:06. Wicker placed 31st in 18:25, Montgomery 67th in 18:50, Eccles 72nd in 18:51 and Zimmerman 74th in 18:52 for a team total of 255 points, good for fifth overall.
    
    
                      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, Bailee Margolis '19, suffering from lower leg tightness, went out way too fast, splitting 5:37 at mile one, but holding on for a 19:26, placing 21st in the race. Liz Cox '18 did not run to her potential, but still did well in 19:34, placing 28th.
    
    
                      
    
    Like the men, the women have some work to do. If Zeinstra figures out her stomach illness and the women run with more focus and determination they will be very difficult to beat.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT will be racing at the Connecticut College Invitational at the same course where the NCAA New England Regional Championship will be held.

    MIT Sweeps NEWMAC Victories
    
    
                      
    
    **Men Claim 18th in Succession, Women Ninth**
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                      
    
    November 1, 2015
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's nationally ranked Men's and Women's Cross Country teams at 10th and 3rd respectively, entered the NEWMAC Championship favored to win their 18th in a row on the men's side and the ninth in succession for the women. Season long injuries combined with a strong WPI men's team and a nationally ranked women's team from Wellesley posed a serious threat to MIT. The Engineers were not taking anything for granted.
    
    
                      
    
    Returning to the Tech lineup for the first time this season as he comes back from a stress fracture was All America Matt Deyo '16. To ease Deyo into the competition and to work on group running, MIT was looking for a somewhat slow first mile in 4:50-5:00. MIT was going for a one through five sweep, but with WPI's top runners, who had split MIT's top two runners in two previous races, Tech runners would have to be really tough in the middle of the race.
    
    
                      
    
    Following directions, MIT posted up behind the lead runners. However, the pace was a bit too slow with MIT runners bunched up between 5:02-5:05. The second mile, which is inherently slower due to Bear Cage Hill, was a strong one for MIT as Rory Beyer '17 took a one second lead over Deyo and two seconds over the rest of his teammates. Both of WPI's runners were with the MIT pack and looked as though they were there to stay. At the three mile mark, Beyer came through in 15:32 along with Deyo and Colin Godwin '16, a trained EMT, who was racing well despite taking a large chunk of time from his warmup to give medical attention to a young lady who had passed out during the women's race. 
    
    
                      
    
    The third mile was the best opportunity to put their foot on the accelerator to drop their opponents, but they instead continued to run 5:15 pace as they did for the more difficult second mile. During the fourth mile MIT's top five runners were still within two seconds of each other, but so too were the runners from WPI. Coming down off their second time on Bear Cage Hill Godwin made a surge to take the lead from Ryan Moran of WPI, which he held to the finish line in 25:35. Beyer also went around Moran as they made the final turn to the finish line, finishing in second in 25:37. In the final fifty meters, Daniel Weiss '19 took over third place in 25:39. Dennis Maloney '19 nearly took fourth place but could not quite get around Moran as he finished in 25:40. Just behind was Deyo in sixth place as he faded in the final mile due to only have started running on Monday.  Claiming five of the top six places fell short of the team's goal, but it was a very impressive showing with only a 12 second delta. MIT's 17 points earned them a 32 point victory over second placed WPI.
    
    
                      
    
    Godwin earned Runner of the Year honors and Weiss took Rookie of the Year honors, giving the men a clean sweep of available awards. In addition to the top five, other MIT runners in the top 14, thus earning All NEWMAC honors were Cooper Sloan '18 in 8th, Nicholas Waltman '18 in 9th and Alex Knoedler '18 in 10th.
    
    
                      
    
    The women's race had the same flavor as the men's except Wellesley had a legitimate five runners who could get the job done. While MIT wanted to follow for the first mile, so did the Wellesley runners. The net effect was a very slow first mile with MIT's top runners bunching up between 5:50 and 5:52. Tech runners were more aggressive in the second mile as Maryann Gong '17 led the way in 11:35. Christina Wicker '17 was supposed to be with Gong, but had fallen off badly, coming through in 11:48. Close behind were Nicole Zeinstra '16 in 11:51, Mary Eccles '18 in 11:52 and Leandra Zimmerman in 11:54. In the third mile MIT pulled away from the Wellesley team with the exception of Priyanka Fouda '16, who was hanging with the MIT chase pack. 
    
    
                      
    
    Gong dropped a 5:48 final mile to create nearly a 30 second gap as she cruised to the finish in 18:04 for the slightly long 5K course. Zimmerman ran an excellent last mile to get into an all out sprint with Fouda, but lost at the finish in 18:30. Eccles finished fourth in 18:41. Zeinstra was fifth in 18:43 and Wicker sixth in 18:46. Megan Montgomery '19, still coming back from a hamstring injury, was cautious, but still finished in 10th in 19:01. MIT scored 19 points to 37 for Wellesley in the 11 team field.
    
    
                      
    
    Gong earned Runner of the Year and Zimmerman Rookie of the Year honors to give the women the same sweep of awards as the men. 
    
    
                      
    
    MIT will not race next weekend, but will race in the NCAA New England Division III Regional Championship / National Qualifier on November 14 at Harkness Park in Waterford, CT. The top two teams earn automatic births to the NCAA Division III Championship in Oshkosh, WI on November 21. Other at-large teams can be earned, particularly in a region as stong as New England's.

    Engineers Cannot Overcome Injuries or Competition
    
    
                      
    
    ##### Women Third, Men Fourth at Purple Valley Classic
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                      
    
    September 26, 2015
    
    
                      
    
    In their first intercollegiate race of the season, the Engineers traveled to Williamstown to take on 20+ teams from New England, New York, California and Texas in the annual Purple Valley Classic. Both the men's and women's teams had top runners out due to injury and the 8K for men and 6K for women were the longest cross country races ever for the many freshmen on the team.
    
    
                      
    
    The men raced first. Going into the meet there were seven top 21 nationally ranked teams representing Division III in the race. Amherst was ranked third, MIT tied for sixth, Williams eighth, Pomona Pitzer 13th, SUNY Geneseo 16th, Tufts 21st and Middlebury 26th. There was certainly no shortage of competition. MIT was missing their top runner, Matt Deyo '16, as well as number three (Rory Beyer '18) and five runners (Josh Rosenkranz '19), who were all sitting out, taking care of minor injuries. The remaining group of youngsters were there to step up and compete for the team title despite missing their upper class leaders.
    
    
                      
    
    Typical of inexperienced harriers with high expectations, Tech runners went right to the front, certainly more aggressively than they should have done. By the mile mark, which they hit in 5:12, they had settled in pretty well, but the first 800 had been run pretty hard and was likely to take its toll when they hit the big hill for the second time, during the fourth mile.
    
    
                      
    
    The second mile was strong for the Engineers although they hit the hill the first time and slowed to a 5:22 mile because of it. MIT was still towards the front and packed pretty well with four at 10:34, and all but one of their teammates within 10 seconds.
    
    
                      
    
    The third mile was another exceptional mile for MIT. Nicholas Waltman '18 stayed amongst the leaders, dropping a 5:06 to do so. He pulled ahead of Dan Weiss '19, and Dennis Maloney '19 by five seconds. Ben Freed '18 fell back a little but was still only two seconds behind the freshmen. Alex Knoedler '18 and Alex Knapp '19 were only 10 seconds behind Waltman and hanging pretty tough.
    
    
                      
    
    The fourth mile, the second time up the big hill, is what separates the men from the boys in this sport, on that course. MIT did not do well in this case. Weiss moved up to Waltman, or Waltman back to Weiss, but they were together at the end of mile four in 21:05. Maloney was only three seconds back, but Freed was 10 seconds behind that and Knoedler another four seconds. 
    
    
                      
    
    Weiss finished in 11th in 26:12; Waltman 15th in 26:19; Maloney 19th in 26:23, Freed 26th in 26:38 and Knoedler 30th in 26:41 for a 29 second delta. MIT will need to hope their upper classmen can join the outstanding freshmen and sophomore classes so they can compete with the front runners a little better.
    
    
                      
    
    In the end, MIT finished fourth as a team with 98 points, losing to three nationally ranked teams, Amherst, Williams and SUNY Geneseo. Weiss and Maloney were the top two freshmen in the field. Tech races again in two weeks at the NEICAAA Championship, a race that pits Division I, II and III colleges in New England against each other.                  
    
    
                      
    
    The women were ranked second in the country, but without Sarah Quinn '16 and Anna Frederich '18 it would be difficult to perform at that level against the competition, which included SUNY Geneseo at #3 in the country, Williams at #6, Middlebury at #7 and Amherst at #18.
    
    
                      
    
    The start looked great, a little too great as the women hit the half mile in 2:49 for the leaders, which included Maryann Gong '17 and Christina Wicker '17. Unfortunately, the second group of MIT runners were up there as well in 2:52. While the first mile is flat and fast, runners who do not run with caution tend to pay for it in the third mile when the women race up the big hill. Gong and Wicker hit the mile in 5:51, four seconds up on Nicole Zeinstra '16, Mary Eccles '18 and Megan Montgomery '19. MIT's next group was perhaps being a little too cautious as they were :22 back from their teammates. 
    
    
                      
    
    Mile two was the same for Gong as she took the lead, splitting a 5:52. Unfortunately Wicker was not mentally prepared at all for this race as she had not been sleeping as much as she needed and it showed up at this point. Her 6:20 mile took her completely out of the race. Zeinstra had moved up well with a 5:55 mile as did Eccles with a 5:57. Montgomery was having hamstring issues in the second mile but was holding on, just :13 behind Gong
    
    
                      
    
    The hill indeed took its toll on the Engineers. Gong, once in the lead did not continue to be aggressive, losing some of her competitiveness and slowing down to 6:09 pace. Zeinstra was :13 back, Eccles :27 back, Montgomery another :10 behind and Leandra Zimmerman '19 had moved up to save the day, but was still :52 behind Gong.
    
    
                      
    
    The final .73 was not kind to Tech. MIT lost a lot of ground to Williams and Middlebury and put more spread between their top runners. When the dust settled, Gong finished third in 22:06. Zeinstra was ninth in 22:32 while Eccles was 16th in 22:47. Montgomery finished 20th in 23:05 and Zimmerman was 21st in 23:10. While Gong can certainly run a stronger race, MIT needs to close the gap between one and two as well as the overall delta between one and five.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT will be off next week, but returns to action at the NEICAAA Championship on October 10 at Franklin Park, a race that is appropriately nicknamed the All New Englands as it pits all Division I, II and III teams against each other in  varsity and sub-varsity races.

    Men and Women Race Poorly at Regionals, Hope to Get Opportunity at Redemption at Nationals
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                      
    
    November 14, 2015
    
    
                      
    
    The Men's and Women's Cross Country teams from MIT entered the NCAA Division III New England Regional Championship seeded eighth and third in the country for Division III respectively. Within the region they were seeded third on the men's side behind Williams and Amherst and second on the women's side behind Williams. Running in arguably the strongest of eight regions in the country, in addition to the top two teams earning automatic births to next week's NCAA Division III Championship, there was an assumption that four or even five additional teams may be selected along with the automatic selections per gender.
    
    
                      
    
    The conditions were extremely windy on the course at Harkness Memorial Park in Waterford, Connecticut. The course was also a bit soft due to the rain over the prior two days. Both factors would slow the performances significantly. The wind kept anyone from attempting a breakaway so the women came through the mile mark in a conservative 5:44 for the leaders. Maryann Gong '17 was in that lead group. The other six MIT runners were just a bit back at 5:48. The second mile, which was mostly into the wind, slowed a bit as the lead group grew even larger while coming through two miles in 11:43 with Gong  still up with the leaders. The remaining Tech runners were starting to spread out, but Leandra Zimmermann '19 and Mary Eccles '18 were racing well still only four seconds back in 11:47. 
    
    
                      
    
    Here the race picked up a bit and it seemed most of the MIT pack simply did not want it as badly as their opponents. Gong came through the third mile in 17:32 looking as though she was holding back, just waiting for her kick once they turned away from the wind ~3.5 miles. Zimmermann was having an outstanding race, coming through in 17:38, as was Eccles at 17:42, although she had lost some focus in allowing Zimmermann to pull ahead. After these three runners MIT's good news was over.  Nicole Zeinstra '16, coming back from the flu and a digestive issue did not handle the discomfort well, hitting the three mile at 17:52. Megan Montgomery '19 was just behind at 17:55. All Americans Christina Wicker '17 and Sarah Quinn '16 were having bad days for different reasons; Wicker because she was not mentally prepared for the race and Quinn because she is suffering through her third compartment syndrome injury.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final .73, Gong pulled away, unleashing a vicious kick in the final quarter mile to drop the leaders by :07 seconds to win in 21:36, the third female regional winner for MIT. Zimmermann held on for ninth place in 21:57. Eccles lost quite a few places, finishing in 27th place in 22:13. Zeinstra was 33rd in 22:24. Montgomery lost a lot of ground, finishing 44th in 22:38 to close out the scoring. 
    
    
                      
    
    Williams College ran with the confidence MIT did the year before when the Engineers won the meet with 40 points. Williams totaled 44 points to easily run away with the victory. Tufts University put together a nice race to claim second with 107 points, just one point ahead of third place Middlebury College and seven points in front of MIT at 114 points.
    
    
                      
    
    The men from MIT hoped to compete favorably with Williams and Amherst, but hoping is not the same as believing. While the men got off the line well, they did not work together as they have all season. Matt Deyo '16, only running for two and a half weeks after suffering a stress fracture, went to an ill advised lead despite the strong head wind, and held the lead until nearly the mile mark, which he hit in 4:54. Colin Godwin '17, planning on working with Deyo, and Rory Beyer '17 were both back at a more reasonable 4:56 with the lead pack. Daniel Weiss '19, MIT's most consistent runner all year, was not being his aggressive self, two seconds back at 4:58, along with Dennis Maloney '19 and Cooper Sloan '18. Alex Knoedler '18, a replacement for the injured Nicholas Waltman '18, was in a great place at 5:01. 
    
    
                      
    
    Throughout the second mile MIT runners continued to work alone, losing the advantage they had all season. At the end of the second mile, Deyo fell back to Godwin and Beyer at 10:00. Weiss was back at 10:06, not running at all like himself, and Sloan was at 10:08. Knoedler was staying close at 10:11, but Maloney ran a 5:17 mile and was quickly falling further back.
    
    
                      
    
    Throughout the next two miles the trend was continuing. Godwin was moving ahead of Beyer and Deyo was paying for the misadventure of his first mile.  Weiss fell back to Knoedler, who was continuing to run a solid race. Cooper fell apart and dropped behind Maloney.
    
    
                      
    
    At the finish Godwin was 12th in 25:08 and Beyer 14th in 25:14. Neither of those were as high as they should have been, but were not disastrous for the team. Deyo finished in 24th in 25:28 and Weiss won his last mile battle with Knoedler to finish 36th in 25:40 compared to Knoedler's 42nd in 25:45. MIT had a respectable total of 128 points, but that was only good enough for fifth place. Williams earned the double victory with 67 points, just one point ahead of Amherst. Tufts was in third with 80 points and Wesleyan surprised a lot of folks with a fourth place finish with 114 points.
    
    
                      
    
    Sunday at 3:00 the official announcement will come regarding which at-large teams will be selected.  If selected MIT will have a rare opportunity to show of what they are truly capable.
