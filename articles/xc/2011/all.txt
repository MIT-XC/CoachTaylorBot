    **Varsity Men Win Close One Over Alumni, No Score in Women's Meet**
    
    
                      
    
    September 3, 2011
    
    
                      
    
    The course certainly ran slow due to the high grass and soft ground, and the high heat and humidity further slowed the runners at the annual MIT Alumni/ae Meet at Franklin Park, MIT's home course. The slow times did not take away from the competition, which is really what cross country is all about. The Varsity men outlasted the former MIT runners by a score of 24 to 31. In the women's meet, only one alum toed the line and the Varsity, while starting five only finished four--negating any score.
    
    
                      
    
    There was tremendous representation from the Alumni on the men's side as 13 individuals representing four decades of MIT Cross Country ran the 8K race. At the start, the two teams were even as they took off across the open field. By the mile mark, the Varsity five man team was slightly ahead of the trailing "Has Beens".
    
    
                      
    
    At the two mile mark, Andrew Erickson '12, took a strong lead over freshman Matt Jordan, Chris Wong '08, and teammate Dawit Zewdie '13. The third mile was not a strong one for the varsity as Erickson let Wong back into the race and Jordan faded behind Zewdie. After a bit of a gap, Ethan Crain '96 led Ben Schmeckpeper '05 and varsity member Jan McKenna '13. While the varsity had a strong lead, the race could still go either way.
    
    
                      
    
    The fourth mile was a good one for Zewdie as he took a slight lead over Wong and Erickson. Jordan had a solid lead over Crain, and McKenna started to pull away from Schmeckpeper and Bill Phipps '10. At the finish, Erickson put the finishing touches on a 5:11 last mile to bury the competition. Wong was second overall and first for the Alums. After Zewdie and Jordan claimed third and fourth, the Alumni had four of the next five as Crain took fifth and Phipps, Schmeckpeper and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, claimed 7-8-9, just behind a sprinting McKenna, putting five ahead of the varsity's fifth, Jacob Young '13.
    
    
                      
    
    Other Alums racing were Jack Bourbonnais '10, Bob Collins '82, Josh Feldman '97, Terry McNatt '87, Tony Pelosi '01, Richard Prevost '11, Bill Singhose '90, and Bob Walmsley '84.
    
    
                      
    
    Rumor has it two Alumni weddings prevented many of the more recent Alumnae from attending the race. As a result, the lone entry for the Alumnae was Andrea Bradshaw '09. Although there was no score in the race, Bradshaw disposed of the Varsity team without much of a contest.
    
    
                      
    
    By the one mile mark, Bradshaw had a five second lead and the race never got any closer. At one point, Bradshaw had around a 15 second lead, but Maggie Lloyd '12, managed a strong third mile to close the lead back down to five seconds at the finish. Kali Benavides '14, finished four seconds behind Lloyd in 20:04. Sarah Sprague '12, was third for the Varsity and Margaret Coad '14, was fourth. Olivia Papa '13, dropped out after the first mile with breathing difficulty.
    
    
                      
    
    Next year it is hoped the attendance will be much greater. To enhance this possibility, the race distances will be shortened to 3K for the women and 5K for the men. In addition, all MIT runners will participate in the races.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT will again enter a partial team, not including any of their top seven runners as they host the Engineers Cup, a meet with RPI and WPI on Saturday at 1:00 for the women and 1:40 for the men.

    **Women Win Bowdoin Invite Without Top Five**
    
    
                      
    
    Men Claim Second, Hold Out Top Twelve
    
    
                      
    
    October 1, 2011
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                      
    
    MIT traveled to Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME to test out the NCAA Division III New England Region Championship course on Saturday. Most of MIT's runners, the top 12 men and all but two of the top 10 women experienced the course prior to the races, doing a fartlek for a hard workout. Those who did race represented MIT well as the women squeaked out a close two point victory over host Bowdoin in the 10 team field, 67 to 69. The men did not fair as well as Bowdoin swept the top six places, but the Engineers managed second place, also with 67 points.
    
    
                      
    
    The course was extremely wet and quite muddy as it had rained  all night and morning, and continued to drizzle during the race. Despite the perfectly flat course, it did not run fast as it was like running on a sponge and the many turns were quite treacherous in the late going as the terrain became muddier.
    
    
                      
    
    Stephanie Marzen '15, racing for the first time this year due to a bout with a cold that did not seem to want to go away, led the way for the Engineers with a seventh place overall finish in 23:37 for the 6K race. Milly Helmick '15, also racing for the first time due to an IT band issue, was close behind in 10th in 23:47. Cindy Huang '15, raced very well for her first 6K, placing 13th in 24:16. Chandler Burfield '13, also raced well, but cautiously, placing 18th in 24:28. Janice O'Brien '12, finished in 19th place, making a significant improvement over her previous two races, running 24:30, virtually tying with teammate Sarah Sprague '13, in 20th, to close out the scoring.
    
    
                      
    
    The leaders went out in what seemed a slow 6:10 first mile, but the course was not allowing much more than that. By the second mile, Marzen was still close to the leaders at 12:21, but Helmick and the others had fallen back by at least nine seconds. The third mile did in Marzen, who was still battling her cold earlier this week, as she ran a 6:34, still the fastest mile three for MIT. MIT closed well as many had lost focus during the third mile and realized this as they approached the finish, having more left than they should have had.
    
    
                      
    
    Andrew Erickson '12, led the way for MIT, placing 11th overall in 27:04, despite running with one untied shoe for nearly the entire race. Jay McKenna '14, was right behind in 27:06 in 12th place. Matt Weaver '12, had a great race, placing 14th in 27:11. Kris Frey '15, was 17th in 27:14, giving MIT a 10 second delta through four runners. Eric Safai '14, running his first race of the season, seemed to be getting used to racing again as he faded in the middle of the race to place 23rd in 27:46.
    
    
                      
    
    Erickson went out just behind the leaders and was the only Tech runner who did. He came through the mile in 5:12, a bit behind the leaders. McKenna was in the second group at 5:16 along with the others. By the second mile, Erickson fell back due to his shoe, but remained competitive at 5:14 while the rest of the team fell back to around 5:24 pace. The pace continued to degrade for the Engineers as the third mile slowed to the 5:30's and the fourth mile the 5:40's, although the mile marks may have been off. The fifth mile was timed between 5:01 and 5:20 for Tech runners and they did not seem to accelerate that much.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT goes to the its home course, Franklin Park, for the biggest race so far this season, the NEICAAA Championship, a race for all the colleges in New England despite their NCAA Division affiliation.

    **Alexandra Taylor Leads Engineer's to Title**
    
    
                      
    
    Men Run to RPI's Strength and Lose Meet
    
    
                      
    
    September 10, 2011
    
    
                      
    
    Alexandra Taylor '14, won her first race as an MIT athlete and did it in extraordinary fashion, running nearly a minute PR, finishing the 5K course in 19:36 to win the Engineer's Cup by 15 seconds. Taylor's effort led Tech to the team title despite not running any of their top seven runners. MIT led the way with 23 points to 41 for RPI and 61 for WPI.
    
    
                      
    
    Ben Mattocks '12, led the way for the MIT men, but the effort was not enough to see the team to victory. RPI claimed 1st, 3rd, 4th, 7th and 8th to score 23 points to 37 for MIT and 66 for WPI.
    
    
                      
    
    The course was like a sponge after three consecutive days of rain, which certainly slowed the times by a minute or so. However the temperatures were pleasant with a dry 75 degrees with a slight breeze, so for this time of fall it was a very nice day for racing.
    
    
                      
    
    The pack of women started a little too fast and it showed at the first mile as the leaders came through in 6:03. It was even more obvious the initial pace was too fast as only Taylor was able to come close to her first mile pace, hitting the two mile mark in 12:28, giving her a :06 lead over teammate Shivani Kaushal '15.
    
    
                      
    
    By the end of the third mile Taylor had built an insurmountable lead at 18:56. Kaushal had fallen back to fourth as two from RPI moved ahead. MIT packed in four runners with Kaushal at 19:59, Claire O'Connell '14, in 20:06, Louise van den Heuvel '14, in 20:30 and Cindy Huang '15, in 20:33 to put the meet away.
    
    
                      
    
    Despite not racing any of their top seven runners, the men from MIT could very well have won this race had they played to their strength, but instead they played to RPI's strength, allowing themselves to get passed in the latter stages of the race. Primarily middle-distance runners with exceptional mile speed, the MIT harriers were supposed to let RPI lead, and depending on the pace, take command of the race during the third or fourth mile. Showing no discipline, MIT was out front at the mile mark, coming through in 5:13, pretty fast for the course conditions with a big target on their back. By mile two, Justin Bullock '14, coming through in 10:46 along with teammates Mattocks and Logan Trimble '13 were just behind the lead RPI runner. RPI had about a dozen runners right behind, biding their time. Mixed in with the RPI runners were freshmen Chadd Kiggins and Kris Frey.
    
    
                      
    
    By mile three the pace spread out the field as the RPI runners began to take control and walk down the fatiguing MIT runners, but many of them had also faded out the back. Bullock was still in the lead at 16:16, but was looking fatigued. Mattocks was two seconds back, but Trimble had fallen in arrears by seven seconds behind Mattocks. RPI was now in the lead with runners in 2, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10 places, but Frey was catching back up to Kiggins to give MIT some hope. If MIT could have a strong final two miles they could get the job done.
    
    
                      
    
    It was not to be as Bullock faded badly in the final two miles, ending up in 5th in 27:10. Mattocks had a very strong final two miles, running 10:26, but was outkicked at the finish by Jeff Corelli from RPI, both timed in 26:44. RPI packed in runners in 3rd, 4th, 7th and 8th for the 23 point total. Trimble had cramps in his calves, but still managed a strong final mile to catch up to Bullock for 6th. Kiggins finished in 11th while Frey ended up 13th.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week MIT will race their top runners for the first time this season in the UMass Dartmouth Invitational. In 2010 MIT claimed second in both the men's and women's races and they hope to improve on that result in 2011.

    **Women Conclude Season With 5th Place Finish at NCAA Division III Championship**
    
    
                      
    
    November 19, 2011
    
    
                      
    
    The MIT women's team traveled to the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship, hosted by the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh at the Lake Breeze Golf Course, seeded seventh in the country. True to tradition, Tech moved up on their seed, placing fifth with 276 points.
    
    
                      
    
    Over the past four years, MIT, now one of the countries top teams, has finished 10th (2008), 5th (2009), 3rd (2010) and now 5th again in 2011.
    
    
                      
    
    Freshman Elaine McVay continued her excellence by leading the way for the Engineers, placing 38th overall, missing All America honors by three places. McVay ran the 6K course in 21:45, a 5:51 per mile average. Martina de Geus '14, was second for Tech for the first time this year, running an outstanding race, finishing in 52nd place in 21:55. Brooke Johnson '13, typically MIT's number one runner, was exhausted and struggled on this day as she began falling back after the two mile mark, losing 53 places in the final 1.73 miles to finish 72nd in 22:06. Finishing fourth for MIT was co-captain, Tania Morimoto '12. Although Morimoto lost 39 places in the final 1.73 miles, she ran a courageous race, never giving up. Claire O'Connell '14, closed out the scoring for the Engineers with her 22:30 for 132nd place. Also competing for MIT were freshmen, Stephanie Marzen and Dacie Manion.
    
    
                      
    
    The team scoring is achieved by taking the individuals out of the scoring, which provided the following scores for MIT: McVay 25th, de Geus 35th, Johnson 48th, Morimoto 76th and O'Connell 92nd.
    
    
                      
    
    Early in the race MIT looked very good, possibly in first place through two miles. Other than de Geus, MIT runners faded, some due to physical fatigue, some due to doubts about their ability and some simply losing focus for periods in the race.
    
    
                      
    
    This team is accustomed to a lot of success. Although finishing fifth at the NCAA Championship is quite an accomplishment, the team was not satisfied with their cumulative result and knows they could have competed better collectively. They must now focus on their goals for next year and do what is necessary to return to the podium.
    
    
                      
    
    Dan Harper '12, was the lone representative for MIT at the NCAA Division III Championship. Harper was determined to finish as an All America runner after missing by 13 places in 2010. He did everything necessary this year to make it happen, proving to be one of the most dedicated athletes in the program's history. However, it was not to be as Harper never got closer than at the finish when he eventually moved up to 64th place in 25:01.
    
    
                      
    
    Harper's plan was to be with the leaders at the mile mark, but once in the race, felt the pace was too fast as the leaders came through the first mile in 4:39 while Harper was back in 74th place at 4:50. He moved up slightly to 67th place by the two mile mark, but had fallen behind the leaders by 32 seconds. Seeming to run with caution for the next two miles, Harper fell back to 72nd place. In the final mile, he moved up eight places by the finish.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT was represented well on this cold and cloudy day. It is a tribute to the program's success that the team and individuals have such high expectations, even when running against the best in all of Division III.

    **WOMEN ADVANCE TO NATIONALS, MEN'S POOR START, FAILURE TO RACE ENDS SEASON**
    
    
                      
    
    November 12, 2011
    
    
                      
    
    At the NCAA Division III New England Region Championship, hosted by Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME, MIT's women harriers, ranked fifth in the country, advanced to the National Championship next Saturday in Oshkosh, WI. The men, defending New England Champions, finished sixth, failing to advance by one team, ending their season on a sour note.
    
    
                      
    
    The women took to the soggy, but flat 6K course with the intent of challenging for the win. Elaine McVay '15, got out a bit too fast at the start, wasting a lot of unnecessary energy. The rest of the team got out well and were in good position to move up during the race.
    
    
                      
    
    At the end of the first mile, Brooke Johnson '13, and McVay were with the leaders at 5:35. Tania Morimoto '12, was too far back (13 seconds) and the rest of the team, Martina deGeus '14, Stephanie Marzen '15, Sarah Sprague '13 and Dacie Manion '15, were back at 5:52. This was too big a gap for the first mile, particularly when the goal was for a delta of less than 45 seconds through five runners. By contrast, both Middlebury and Williams, the top two teams, had all seven of their runners among the top 35, which were all ahead of MIT's third runner. If MIT, who had gone out more conservatively had raced well and with determination, they should have been able to pass many of the front runners who had gone out too fast.
    
    
                      
    
    Mile two saw Johnson hold onto the leaders as they pushed the pace, running another 5:35 mile. McVay fell off a couple seconds back of Johnson, showing some of the fatigue resulting from her fast start, but still holding onto eighth place. Morimoto was now 33 seconds back of Johnson, and deGeus seven more seconds back, was pulling ahead of the rest of the MIT team.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final mile and three quarter, Morimoto lost another 46 seconds. A very reliable Manion late in the season, faded big in the final .72, losing a minute and 25 seconds. Fortunately, Johnson and McVay held onto sixth and seventh place respectively. McVay was the top freshman in the race of 353 finishers. deGeus closed well to finish in 32nd place. Marzen moved up a few places to finish in 43rd place, three places ahead of Morimoto.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's 134 points were good enough for third place out of 51 teams in the country's strongest region for Division III. Top ranked Williams College finished in second with 60 points, five points behind third ranked Middlebury College.
    
    
                      
    
    The men did not get out well. Being in the middle with no real quality teams around them, they allowed the teams on the far right and left to get out ahead and squeeze them back. Even by the 3/4 mile mark, Dan Harper '12, MIT's top runner, was still back in about 50th place with his teammates at least 30 places behind him.
    
    
                      
    
    By the second mile Harper had moved up to 20th place with Stephen Serene '12, right behind him. Roy Wedge '14, was in about 30th place, only five seconds behind Harper. Freshman Allen Leung was leading the way of the second group of Tech runners, but they were back about 20 places from Wedge. Considering where they started the group of Engineers had done well.
    
    
                      
    
    However, the third mile hurt MIT. Harper stopped passing people. Serene and Wedge continued to move up, but the rest started falling back. Leung fell back 10 seconds during the mile, Ben Mattocks '12, 13 seconds, and Andrew Erickson '12, 20 seconds.
    
    
                      
    
    The final two miles was more of the same, except Harper started passing people again and Wedge fell back a bit, losing nearly 20 seconds to Harper and Serene. Harper moved up to 12th place in 25:07, possibly qualifying for individual honors to go to NCAA's if the committee decides to take five teams. Serene was only two seconds back, running an excellent race, particularly given how far back he started. Wedge finished in 32nd place in 25:27 to earn All New England honors, but this was not a good race for the sophomore. Mattocks moved past Leung, but fell back to 66th position in 26:10. Leung was close behind in 26:14. 
    
    
                      
    
    Tech's score of 195 points was 20 points out of fifth place. The disappointment was palpable as expectations were so high due to the ability and readiness of the team. 
    
    
                      
    
    The women will move on to the NCAA Championship for the fourth consecutive year, hoping to have similar success as last year when after finishing fourth in the region they turned around and placed third at Nationals.

    **Men Earn Highest Place in Modern Era In All New England Championship**
    
    
                      
    
    October 8, 2011
    
    
                      
    
    In their second race of the season, the Men's Varsity competed in the New England Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association (NEICAAA) Championship. This meet pits Division I, II and III colleges in New England against each other as it has since 1877. This meet tends to compare favorably with the NCAA Division III Championship regarding place for both team and individual. So, when the NCAA Division III 7th ranked Engineers toed the line it was with the intent to compete at a level relative to their ranking. Despite racing without top freshmen Karl Baranov and Spencer Wenck due to injuries, MIT was confident that those racing would step up and get the job done. This they did even though another freshman, Benji Xie, collapsed at the 2 3/4 mile mark, possibly due to the heat (83 degrees and very sunny). Finishing 6th overall and second among Division III teams with 244 points shows that if they can get their entire top seven healthy they will be a contender to do very well at the NCAA Division III Championship on November 19.
    
    
                      
    
    The women, ranked 3rd in the country, but also running in the absolute strongest region in the country for Division III, also had the intent to race well, but did not seem to be as hungry as the men to get the job done. Where the men ran with pure determination and without doubt, the women kept wondering if they could meet their goals. While they placed 8th overall and third among Division III teams with 276 points, it was obvious they could have done significantly better.
    
    
                      
    
    The women competed first on the soft course (due to heavy rains earlier in the week). 39 teams and 269 individuals finished the race as the extreme heat took its toll on some of the runners. MIT got off the line well and positioned themselves well at the mile mark. The plan was to come through the first mile at 5:40-5:45 pace, which would put them in a favorable position given how fast the women competitors usually take the race out and the resulting decay of pace. MIT was out too fast however, particularly in the high temperatures, with Elaine McVay '15, and Brooke Johnson '13, running together at 5:34. The remainder of the varsity came through in the mid 5:40's. At mile two, McVay and Johnson continued to move up, coming through in 11:46, about 15-20 seconds slower than they should have been, but obviously feeling the effects of the first mile. Tania Morimoto '12, was close at 11:55, along with freshman Dacie Manion. Martina deGeus '15, not running to her potential was back at 12:06, Claire O'Connell '15, running varsity for the first time this year, came through in 12:13 with Maggie Lloyd '12, back at 12:19. In the third mile, McVay poured it on with a 5:59 effort to move into the top 20, however her finishing kick, which due to poor mechanics was not there, got passed by a few to end up in 21st place in 18:27, a superb performance for the freshman. Johnson stopped racing with a mile to go, just running through the motions, but due to her incredible talent still managed to place 37th in 18:42. deGeus finished in 66th in 19:05 even though she admittedly did not focus well the entire race. Morimoto ran 19:07 to place 70th and O'Connell passed a struggling Manion to finish in 86th position in 19:20 to close out the scoring for MIT. Manion, suffering from heat problems for her second race, was only three seconds behind Morimoto with 200 meters to go, but ended up 20 seconds back, barely making it across the line.
    
    
                      
    
    In the sub-varsity race for the women, Stephanie Marzen '15, racing for the second time this season, showed her real abilities as she finished in sixth place in 19:05. Also performing well for MIT was Alexandra Taylor '14, placing 22nd in 19:29.
    
    
                      
    
    The men's varsity were racing at the hottest part of the day. While the relative humidity was moderate, there was no breeze and very little shade. Also getting off the line well, the top six settled in to a very good pace, particularly given the conditions. Originally planning to go out at 4:50 pace, they exercised good sense, and focused more on position, coming through the mile in 4:54 for Dan Harper '12, 4:58 for Allen Leung '15, and Benji Xie '15, 5:00 for Roy Wedge '14, and 5:02 for Stephen Serene '12, and Ben Mattocks '12. By the second mile Harper had moved into the top 30 with a 10:05 effort. The other Tech runners grouped up between 10:20-10:25. Even though Xie dropped out, the remaining varsity runners stepped up, running a very strong fourth mile. Harper was flirting with cracking the top 20, coming through at 20:35, while the rest of the varsity had spread out. Wedge, Serene and Leung were making a strong charge, running 20:55, 21:01 and 21:04 respectively. Mattocks, knowing he was the fifth man regardless of his finish, was hurting, but still fairly close at 21:17. In the fifth mile all MIT runners put everything they had into the race, with Mattocks closing in on the varsity by nine seconds to move up to 71st place overall in 26:12. Harper finished in 22nd place in 25:22. Wedge placed 39th in 25:47, Serene 48th in 25:57 and Leung 66th in 26:04. The sixth place finish among the 43 teams was the highest place for the men since the World War II era.
    
    
                      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, Andrew Erickson '12, ran a great race, placing 11th overall in 26:34.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT will fly to Oshkosh, WI to race in the Division III Pre-National meet. The course is extremely flat and hopefully the temperature will be more seasonable.

    **Men and Women Continue The Streak of NEWMAC Championship Victories**
    
    
                      
    
    October 31, 2011
    
    
                      
    
    The men and women harriers from MIT entered the 14th annual NEWMAC Cross Country Championship as favorites, but Springfield College on the men's side and Wellesley College among the women's teams had the talent to pose individual and team threats to MIT's yearly dominance at this event. Tech's men would be going for their 14th consecutive title having never lost the championship. The women were going for their seventh overall and fifth consecutive title.
    
    
                      
    
    The championship, originally scheduled for Saturday, was moved to Sunday early in the season when it was determined there were too many races already scheduled for Saturday at Boston's premier cross country course, Franklin Park.  On Friday of this week, with the predicted snow and rain, combined with the onslaught of races, the Boston Parks Department shut down Franklin Park from Saturday afternoon at 1:00 until Monday, moving the NEWMAC Championship to Monday at 3:00. This caused academic issues among all the colleges as student-athletes arranged to miss classes or exams.
    
    
                      
    
    The conditions were very muddy and wet with the temperatures in the upper 40's to low 50's. While great cross country conditions, no one was expecting fast times. While MIT runners were aware of this, the great performances begs the question how fast can they run on a dry course?
    
    
                      
    
    The men started things off, guaranteed to dig up the course for the women. Springfield College flew across the field at the gun to take the initial lead while MIT was content to save their energy. The first half mile was a conservative 2:32, so MIT's top runners moved to the front. After the mile split of 5:04, Dan Harper '12, took control along with teammates Roy Wedge '14, and Stephen Serene '12. The trio ran a 5:14 second mile, opening up a decisive gap on the first Springfield runner. Continuing to speed up, Harper and Wedge threw down a 5:12 third mile. Serene fell back some as he lost a little focus. While MIT's top three were busy opening up a larger gap, Ben Mattocks '12, and Alan Leung '15, were busy moving up in the field, picking off opposing runners. At the four mile mark, Harper and Wedge came through in 20:38 after a blistering 5:07 mile. Serene had to stop briefly to pull a pine cone off of his spikes, but still came through in 20:47. Mattocks moved up to fifth place overall and Leung was now in the top 10. In the final mile, Harper proved too much for Wedge, the defending NEWMAC champion and 2010 Rookie of the Year, by finishing in 4:50 for a 25:28 victory. Wedge, not too shabby in his own performance, dropped a 4:56 to finish in 25:34. Serene completed the 1-2-3 sweep with his 25:45. Mattocks could not quite get fourth place, finishing three seconds behind Springfield's Ryan O'Connell with a 26:10 effort. Leung finished in eighth, just five seconds out of sixth, running 26:26, earning the 2011 Rookie of the Year. Running as MIT's bumpers, Logan Trimble '13, had a nice breakthrough race, placing 13th in 26:56 and Andrew Erickson '12, finished 16th in 27:00. MIT's 19 points easily outdistanced Springfield College's 44 points. Third was Coast Guard with 75, followed by Babson with 113, WPI with 122, Wheaton with 190 and Clark with 200 points.
    
    
                      
    
    As the women took the course, it was obviously in much worse shape after the men's four loops. Similar to the men, the women took the pace out pretty casually, running 6:04 for the first mile. Brooke Johnson '13, and Elaine McVay '15, should have pushed the pace hard after the half mile mark, but were content to keep a steady pace. In the second mile, Claire O'Connell '14, and Tania Morimoto '12, made a strong move to join Johnson and McVay, coming through two miles in 12:04. Moving up in the pack were MIT's next group, led by Martina deGeus '14, and Dacie Manion '15, both of whom hit two miles in 12:13. Stephanie Marzen '15, should have been with them but was slightly back at 12:17. In the final mile, Morimoto made a slight move, but the group covered it and Randelle Boots '13, of Wellesley, the NCAA Division III Indoor Mile Champion, made a strong move that neither Johnson or McVay could match. Nevertheless, Johnson ran a 6:05 final mile for second place overall in 18:50 for the 5K race despite having a bad head cold. McVay finished third in 18:52, earning NEWMAC Rookie of the Year, and O'Connell finished fourth in 19:01. deGeus and Manion closed out Tech's top five, running 19:08 for sixth and 19:09 for seventh place respectively. Marzen led five more All NEWMAC performers for MIT as she placed ninth in 19:21, followed by Morimoto in 19:22 for 10th, Sarah Sprague '13, in 19:30 for 11th, Shivani Kaushal '15, in 19:31 for 12th and Maggie Lloyd '12, in 19:32 for 13th. The Engineers totaled 22 points, while Wellesley finished in second with 50, followed by Coast Guard with 102, Smith College with 142, Springfield with 163, Babson with 168, Mt. Holyoke with 192, WPI with 196, Clark University with 215 and Wheaton with 243.
    
    
                      
    
    The next meet for MIT is the NCAA Division III Regional Qualifier, hosted by Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME on Saturday, November 12. Going into that meet, MIT's men are seeded fifth in the region while the women are seeded third.

    Johnson Leads Women to Second Place Finish at Pre-Nationals
    
    
                      
    
    Men Do Not Race Aggressively, Place Seventh
    
    
                      
    
    October 15, 2011
    
    
                      
    
    Forty seven teams competed in both the men's and women's races this weekend at the Brook's Pre-National Meet hosted by UW Oshkosh. Numerous nationally ranked teams (9 for the women and 12 for the men) were competing in both  races, including top ranked North Central College, third ranked Calvin and fifth ranked Washington University of St. Louis in the men's race and third ranked Washington University of St. Louis in the women's race. MIT's was ranked fifth for the women and seventh for the men entering the race.
    
    
                      
    
    The women toed the starting line first. Each team was permitted up to 10 runners in the 6K varsity race, making the field nearly 400 strong. At the start the right side of the field pushed hard to the left, shutting down many teams on the left that did not get out. Fortunately, MIT got out well. While the course is quite flat with no significant hills, the start is slightly uphill to the first turn, so getting out well, but not too hard was imperative. 
    
    
                      
    
    Although it had rained for three consecutive days, the course seemed to handle the water well, only seeming a little soft. The other factor affecting the race was the 45 mph winds that were constant throughout the day.
    
    
                      
    
    Coming into the mile mark, Elaine McVay '15, and Brooke Johnson '13, found themselves inadvertently in the lead. Not meaning to take the lead they were passing runners and moving up and suddenly there was no one left to pass, a mistake they should not repeat. With the strong winds no one was going to prevent them from being the buffer. The mile split was pretty quick with both coming through in 5:49. Tania Morimoto '12, and Martina deGeus '14, were fairly close at 5:52. Dacie Manion '15, was not far behind in 5:54 and Alexandra Taylor '14, and Maggie Lloyd '12 were back at 5:58. 
    
    
                      
    
    By the two mile mark, both Johnson and McVay had fallen off the lead, but were still with the lead group, 11:44 and 11:46 respectively. Morimoto moved up past deGeus, but both fell back another 10 seconds from the leaders. At this point it as clear Wash. U. was the superior team, at least on this day as they had eight of their runners ahead of MIT's fifth.
    
    
                      
    
    In the third mile the lead group spread out a lot. Johnson was holding onto fourth and McVay eighth, but both were paying for the mistake in the first mile. deGeus and Manion closed well to move up to 26th and 35th places respectively but Morimoto fell off to 50th place to close out MIT's scoring, giving them a hard fought second place.
    
    
                      
    
    The men were without three of their top freshmen, all members of the top seven, for the second week in succession. Nevertheless they knew they needed to race well. Knowing and doing are often two different things, and this day fell into that category. Dan Harper '12, got out well, intending to run with the leaders and doing so right from the start. Stephen Serene '12, was only three seconds back at the mile mark, but Roy Wedge '14, was much too conservative, particularly on such a fast course, ending up 10 seconds off of Harper at the mile mark. Allen Leung '15, Ben Mattocks '12, and Andrew Erickson '12, were in very close proximity to Wedge, but back in about 100th place, much too far out to be competitive.
    
    
                      
    
    During the second mile Harper continued to stay with the leaders, clocking 10:09 for two miles. Serene slowed down significantly, choosing to not bridge the gap to the leaders, but rather fall off to the next group, hitting the two mile mark in 10:25. Wedge moved up well, as he tends to do, to catch Serene, with Leung staying with them as well. Mattocks was only three seconds back, but they were still back in 70-80th place. Erickson fell off a lot, losing eight seconds to his teammates.
    
    
                      
    
     Mile three saw Harper continue to stay in 13th although the lead group began to spread out a bit. Serene, Leung and Wedge moved up some more, but lost seven or eight more seconds to Harper and the other leaders. Mattocks continued to lose ground as did Erickson.
    
    
                      
    
    With two miles to go the Engineers needed to rally. Even though Harper maintained his 13th position and Serene and Wedge continued to move up to the top 35, Leung fell back during the final two miles, losing 25 seconds to Serene and Wedge. Mattocks lost 30 seconds in the final two miles and no one behind was able to offer the support necessary to help MIT place higher than seventh overall. The 1:04 delta for the top five is just not getting the job done at the level it takes to be a top ranked team.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT is back on the course on Sunday, Oct 30 at Franklin Park for the NEWMAC Championship where the Engineers try to win their 14th consecutive conference title on the men's side and the fifth for the women.

    Johnson and Harper Lead the Way as Tech
    
    
                      
    
     Wins All Four Races at UMass Dartmouth
    
    
                      
    
    September 17, 2011
    
    
                      
    
    For the final weekend of summer, the conditions were quite ideal on the virtually flat, grassy course on the campus of UMass Dartmouth. The temperature was a dry 65 degrees with bright sunshine for the women's races and a little more cloudy for the men's.
    
    
                      
    
    Tech runners took advantage of the conditions as this was the Varsity debut for the presumed top seven on the respective squads. Maggie Lloyd '12, started things off by leading a 1-11 MIT sweep in the Women's Sub-Varsity race, winning in 19:17. In the Women's Varsity Race, Brooke Johnson '13, brought home the gold with an excellent 17:55 victory on the 5K course. When it was the men's turn, Dan Harper '12, led the way for the Engineers with his second place 24:51 performance. In the final race of the day, the Men's Sub-Varsity, Ben Mattocks '12, finished second in 25:59.
    
    
                      
    
    Although there were 37 women's varsity teams in the race, there were no nationally ranked teams in attendance. Despite not running two of the top seven runners, both freshmen, MIT dominated the results. In addition to Johnson's victory, freshman Elaine McVay ran her way to a third place finish in 18:01. Martina deGeus '14, finished very strong to place fifth in 18:34. Another freshman, Dacie Manion, had an excellent collegiate debut, placing seventh in 18:40 and Tania Morimoto '12, closed out the top five with her ninth place finish in 18:49. No other team had more than one runner in the top 10.
    
    
                      
    
    The race was well paced with the MIT quintet going out in 5:48-5:50. In the second mile it became obvious that this was MIT's race. Johnson and McVay had begun to run down Kate Warwick of Brandeis, who had established a large lead and was still nine seconds ahead at the two mile mark despite the MIT runners putting in a 5:51 second mile. The remaining Tech runners slowed a bit to 6:00-6:04 pace, but were still in a dominant position. It took nearly all of the last mile for Johnson to take the lead, but she did so with authority, winning by four seconds. McVay almost claimed second, running out of space as she finished two seconds behind. The women easily won with a score of 25 points. Coast Guard was second with 109 points and Wellesley was third with 114.
    
    
                      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, MIT's mob dealt with the pedestrian early pace, coming through the mile in 6:20, moved up to the front in the second mile with a 6:19 for the first five and then picked it up in the final mile to claim first place. Lloyd pulled away from freshman Kali Benavides in the final straight to claim the one second victory. Just two seconds back was Claire O'Connell '14. Alexandra Taylor '14, took fourth in 19:28 and Shivani Kaushal '15, claimed the fifth spot for MIT, and overall in the race in 19:29. MIT showed remarkable depth as 14 runners were within 2:00 of each other.
    
    
                      
    
    The total delta for MIT in the Men's Varsity race was 62 seconds. However, it would have been within 25 seconds had it not been for a couple of freak situations. Roy Wedge '14, had his glasses knocked off in the third mile and lost about 30 seconds finding them and Benji Xie '15, running with the other MIT runners through 4.5 miles, suddenly started to lose control of his muscles, barely making it to the finish line. It is assumed he was dehydrated going into the race.
    
    
                      
    
    Harper ran a superb race, following the race plan to not be in the lead in the early stages of the race. Rob Dextradeur of Bentley somehow pulled away early and Harper was never able to make up the difference as Dextradeur won in 24:35.
    
    
                      
    
    Outside of Harper and Stephen Serene '12, who went out in 4:58 at the mile, the other MIT runners raced patiently, splitting the first mile in 5:06. In the second mile, Harper had separated himself from his teammates at 10:03. Serene slowed and his teammates sped up as they all came through in 10:11, forming an excellent pack. Other than Wedge losing his glasses, the third mile was excellent as MIT runners passed runners going up the only slight hill on the course putting in a 5:01, virtually putting the race away. The slightly downhill fourth mile was a crisp 4:57 for the Engineer's pack, coming through in a cumulative 20:10. For the most part, MIT harriers still had a bit left, knowing they can be more aggressive in their next race. Harper closed in 4:45. Serene ran a 4:49 final mile to claim fifth place in 25:00. The top freshman in the race, Spencer Wenck made his collegiate debut with a 25:04 seventh place finish. Fellow freshmen, Allen Leung and Karl Baranov placed ninth and eleventh respectively, running 25:05 and 25:16. Wedge and Xie would have been right with their teammates under normal circumstances, giving MIT phenomenal depth. Tech claimed first out of 34 teams with 31 points, followed by Brandeis with 79 and Division II Bentley with 134.
    
    
                      
    
    The Men's Sub-Varsity race went pretty much the same as the previous three races. MIT ran with the pack mentality and although they did not manage to win individual honors, they did finish 2-7 to easily win the team title. Similar to the Women's Sub-Varsity race, the opening mile was painfully slow, 5:18 for the MIT runners. Following the directions to not take the lead until after the second mile, MIT's pack had to endure an even slower second mile of 5:29. With the reins loosened, Tech runners responded with a 5:14 uphill mile to take control of the race. The pack started to spread with the downhill mile opening things up with splits varying between 5:02 and 5:29 for MIT runners. The final mile was again a very competitive mile for MIT, permitting the excellent team finish. Behind Mattocks was Logan Trimble '13, in 26:07, Dawit Zewdie '13, 26:13, Chadd Kiggins '15, 26:15, and Matt Jordan '15, 26:17 to close out the top five for the Engineers.
    
    
                      
    
    Although MIT will next race at the Bowdoin College Invitational in two weeks, the varsity will not race for three weeks, racing again on October 8 at the All Division New England Championship.
