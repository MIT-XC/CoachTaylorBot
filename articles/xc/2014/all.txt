    Varsity Runners Exhibit Tight Deltas in Sweeps over Alums
    
    
                      
    
    August 30, 2014
    
    
                      
    
    In the first race of the season, MIT raced their Alums in short course races at Franklin Park, MIT's home course. The women had a seven second delta for runners one through five on the 1.94 mile course to sweep their older counterparts 15-42. The men raced a 5K, taking the top seven places with a 15 second delta to win 15-50.
    
    
                      
    
    With 80 degree temperature and a bright sunny day, the one thing that made it an acceptable cross country race day was the relatively low humidity. The women raced first. The pace across the field was fast, guaranteed by the sprint across the field by guest runner Abby Klein '14. At the mile mark, Maryann Gong '17, Christina Wicker '17, Anna Frederich '18, Elaine McVay '15 and Nicole Zeinstra '16 led the way at 5:42 with Alexandra Taylor '14, Kaitlin Allen '14, Martina de Geus '14 and Jennifer Doyle '09 trailing for the Alumnae.
    
    
                      
    
    Wicker pushed the pace in the second mile, opening up a large lead as they came off of Bear Cage Hill and onto the field. However, Gong had a furious kick to take the victory in 11:13 to Wicker's 11:15. Frederich was right behind in 11:16, McVay in 11:19 and Zeinstra in 11:20 to complete the sweep.
    
    
                      
    
    In most years, the collective performance by the Alumnae would seriously contend for the victory, but not this year. Taylor placed 6th in 11:30, Allen 7th in 11:35, de Geus in 8th at 11:38 and Doyle 9th in 11:40. Alina Gatowski '11 completed the scoring the alums, finishing in 18th in 12:17. Also competing for the alums were Louise van den Heuvel '14, Maggie Lloyd '12 and Alisha Schor '07.
    
    
                      
    
    Benji Xie '15 did not hold back, taking the lead from the gun. At the mile mark Xie held a five second lead thanks to pushing the second half of that mile in an effort to steal the race. At the two mile mark, Spencer Wenck '15 led the charge to close the gap on Xie, which was now four seconds 10:06 to 10:10. Cooper Sloan '18 was at 10:12. Then there was a gap before Rory Beyer '17, Colin Godwin '17, Nicholas Waltman '18 and Matt Deyo '16 gave chase at 10:18-10:21.
    
    
                      
    
    Logan Trimble '13 and Justin Bullock '14 gave chase and were in the thick of it with Bullock just behind Sloan and Trimble riding on Godwin's tail. The remaining alums, Eric Khatchadourian '06, Eric Safai '14 and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11 had settled near the back.
    
    
                      
    
    As they hit the finish, Xie took first place honors, expanding his lead to six seconds over his teammates with a 15:58 on the slightly long 5K course. Deyo moved up to second in 16:04 with Wenck holding onto third in 16:05. Sloan outkicked fellow freshman Waltman, both being timed in 16:07 to complete the sweep. Close behind was Beyer in 16:10 and Godwin in 16:13. Trimble was right behind in 16:17, but Bullock faded to 16:28. Khatchadourian was 23rd, Safai in 24th and Amarasiriwardena was 25th to close out the scoring for the Alumni.
    
    
                      
    
    Also in attendance for the alums were Stephanie Birkhimer '14 and Brooke Johnson '13, Claire O'Connell, Patrick Barragan '08, Dan Harper '13 and Don Shobrys '75.
    
    
                      
    
    The race ended MIT's pre-season. Classes start on Wednesday as the regular season training gets underway. Tech's first race will be the Purple Valley Classic on 9/27 hosted by Williams College.

    McVay's 12th Place Leads Women to National Runner-up
    
    
                      
    
    Wenck's Places 4th, Men Place 8th
    
    
                      
    
    November 22, 2014
    
    
                      
    
    MIT entered the NCAA Division III Championship ranked number two in the country for the women and eighth in the country for the men. Both teams thought they could better their seed and were determined to run aggressively enough to make that happen. In the end, they placed exactly as seeded, the women earning their highest place ever with second place and the men tying for their highest place ever at eighth place. 
    
    
                      
    
    The normally fast course at King's Island Golf Center in Mason, Ohio endured a snow storm early in the week and then freezing weather all week, leaving residual snow on the course until race day. With hundreds of runners practicing on the course Thursday, Friday and warming up on Saturday, combined with the warming temperatures on race day, the course quickly became a mud pit, slowing times significantly.
    
    
                      
    
    Although relatively flat, the soft course would take a lot out of the runners legs and anyone who went out fast would pay dearly. The plan for MIT was to get out quickly off the line, evaluate the field and ease into the top 20-50 by the mile mark, moving up from there. The plan worked well for Spencer Wenck '15, Colin Godwin '17 and Matt Deyo '16, but not so well for Allen Leung '15, Benji Xie '15, Rory Beyer '17 and Matt Jordan '15. Wenck was out with the leaders hitting the mile in 4:45. Godwin and Deyo were in the top 30 at 4:50 and Beyer and Xie were in the top 70. Leung and Jordan were pretty far out of it as they never got out at the start and were very near the back of the entire field of 280 runners after the first 200 meters.
    
    
                      
    
    Things continued to look very good up front as Wenck, Godwin, Deyo and Xie moved up in the field through the halfway point in the race with Wenck in fourth, Godwin and Deyo in 29th and 30th and Xie in 62nd, but Beyer fell back to the 80's. On the plus side Leung moved up to around 100th and seemed to be on the move. Just before the four mile mark Wenck was still in fourth and Godwin and Deyo moved up to 24th and 25th. However, the wheels started falling off the bus for Xie who had fallen all the way back to 92nd. Leung moved up to 96th, but could he move up enough. If they could hold on or move up a little the Engineers had a shot at the podium where the top four teams are awarded trophies.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final mile Wenck moved into third but was caught at the line giving him fourth place in 23:58. Godwin finished in 22nd and Deyo 25th, both earning All America honors with times of 24:30 and 24:32 respectively. Leung lost 25 places in the final mile and Xie over 50 places, finishing 121st and 145th respectively at 25:29 and 25:35. Beyer, who had been shoved to the ground and banged his head, never really recovered, finishing 185th in 25:49 and Jordan was right behind in 190th in 25:50. With the top 35 receiving All America honors, Wenck, Godwin and Deyo all earned All America status, a record number for MIT. Amazingly, all three had colds going into the race, but did not let it bother them.
    
    
                      
    
    The women had the unfortunate selection of going after the men, and running on a course that was totally wrecked. Even with half inch spikes they were getting little traction. The plan was for Sarah Quinn '16 to go out towards the front and work her way up to the leaders by the mile mark. Maryann Gong '17, Christina Wicker '17 and Elaine McVay '15 were going to get into the top 30 by the mile and work their way up. Nicole Zeinstra '16, suffering from a quad injury and Kali Benavides '15 were hoping to be close behind and trying to beat every team's fifth runner. Mary Eccles '18, a freshman, was trying to even pace the race and be there if anything happened to Tech's front runners.
    
    
                      
    
    The first mile played out as planned with three exceptions. First, Quinn went out too hard, getting caught in front of a chase group focused on catching a breakaway runner and coming through the mile in 5:38. The second was Zeinstra and Benavides not getting out off the line and then getting squeezed to a walk in the first 200 meters. The third and worst error was Zeinstra panicking and moving up to the top 60 or so in the first mile, spending all of her energy in a five minute span.
    
    
                      
    
    By the 2K, Quinn was still in fourth, Wicker and McVay in 14th and 15th, and Zeinstra and Gong in 36th and 40th respectively. MIT was narrowly winning the race over favorite Johns Hopkins. At 3K, Zeinstra began to fade and the score at the halfway point was tied at 79 between Hopkins and MIT.
    
    
                      
    
    In the second half of the race Quinn began to tie up and Zeinstra continued to free fall. On the plus side, Benavides was moving up slowly but surely. At the end of the race, McVay moved up to 12th in 22:00 for 6K, earning her second cross country All America honor. Quinn held on to 16th place in 22:10 and Wicker pulled out a 17th place in 22:12. Gong finished strong to place 32nd in 22:24, giving MIT four All America winners. Hopkins had a two point lead through four runners so it came down to the fifth runner and they had a better finish. Fortunately Benavides moved up to 67th to save MIT's second place finish over a hard finishing St. Lawrence University.
    
    
                      
    
    Given where both teams started, the season was a fantastic success for the Engineers. Losing four of the top seven for the men will challenge this year's freshman class to step up next year if they want to continue to improve on the national scene. The women will lose two of their top seven but have reasonable depth for next year.

    Quinn Leads Team to NCAA Regional Title
    
    
                      
    
    Wenck Earns Runner-up, Men's Team Claims Third
    
    
                      
    
    November 15, 2014
    
    
                      
    
    Going into the NCAA Division III New England Regional Championship hosted by Williams College at the Mt. Greylock High School course, the MIT men's team, ranked eighth nationally, was ranked 3rd behind Williams College, ranked fourth nationally, and Colby College, who was ranked sixth nationally. The incredibly strong New England region also boasted 12th ranked Middlebury, 16th ranked Amherst, 24th ranked Tufts, 30th ranked Bowdoin and 35th ranked Bates College among the 54 teams competing in the race to advance to the NCAA Championship next weekend. There are only two automatic bids per region (eight regions) and then 16 additional at-large teams are selected throughout the eight regions.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's women's team, ranked fourth nationally, entered the meet seeded second behind Middlebury College, ranked third nationally. Host Williams College was seeded sixth nationally, Amherst 21st, Colby 28th and Tufts 30th among the 57 competing teams.
    
    
                      
    
    The weather was a little chilly, but otherwise perfect at 30 degrees and sunny with no wind. The men's race was first. With 54 teams spread across the line, each team only had room for two or three individuals at the front of each box. The sheer numbers normally would make the pace fast as the course narrows significantly prior to the mile mark, making it difficult to pass. MIT ran their own race, and that put them out front a little earlier than they were hoping for. Spencer Wenck '15, Matt Deyo '16, Colin Godwin '17 and Rory Beyer '17 all hit the mile mark together at 5:03 and they were the front pack. Benji Xie '15, Allen Leung '15 and Matt Jordan '15 were all among the top 30 runners at the mile mark, coming through in 5:07, 5:09 and 5:10 respectively.
    
    
                      
    
    The relatively slow pace was due to the respect paid by the runners for the hills that would come in the second and fourth miles. Mile two was the slowest mile for the leaders as no one wanted to take it away from the Engineers and they were happy with how it was going. Wenck and company were 10:20-10:21, still in front, with their teammates about the same distance back as the first mile, but having moved up a few places. Mile three opened things up a little and more of the favorites joined the fray up front. Wenck put down a 5:02 mile to stay in the lead and Deyo and Godwin were right behind. Beyer fell off a little. Xie ran 5:01 to move to 15:29, just two seconds behind Beyer and seven behind Wenck for a very nice three mile, five man delta.
    
    
                      
    
    The fourth mile was fast given the hill and this broke up the lead group. Wenck ran 5:03 but gave up the lead to Colin Cotton of Williams, who flew up the hill. Deyo ran 5:11 and Godwin 5:12 to lose some ground and places. Beyer ran 5:23, Xie 5:20, Leung 5:26 and Jordan 5:29, opening up the possibility for other teams to have a shot at the victory. The final mile was more of the same as Wenck ran a remarkable 4:50 to finish in second place in 25:15, just five seconds behind Cotton and 11 seconds in front of third. Deyo finished hard to claim eighth in 25:38. Godwin was close behind in 12th in 25:42. Beyer came back well to take 19th place honors in 25:57. Xie finished in 29th in 26:10 to close out the scoring for MIT at 70 points. When the smoke settled it turned out to not be quite enough as Colby College won with 63 points and Amherst surprising all to take second with 69 points. MIT had the best depth in the race as Leung finished 33rd in 26:17 and Jordan was 39th in 26:27. MIT laid claim to six All Region honors as the top 35 earned that distinction. There is very little doubt that MIT will not go to Nationals as an at-large team.
    
    
                      
    
    The women started an hour and a half after the men. They hoped to be just as aggressive in their race. At the start, which was very fast, Middlebury runners seized the lead and then instantly slowed the pace. MIT's Elaine McVay '15, Sarah Quinn '16, Christina Wicker '17 and Maryann Gong '17 would have nothing of it and went right around, ignoring their competition. The foursome hit the mile mark in 5:48, a crisp mile indeed. Nicole Zeinstra '16, who was nursing an injured quadricep, was racing as if she had no pain, leading the chase group at the mile in 5:51. Kali Benavides '15 and Mary Eccles '18 came through 6:01, and very much in the race.
    
    
                      
    
    Mile two was exactly the same pace for the lead foursome. The chase group, which had fallen back even more, began to realize that these ladies were not coming back. Zeinstra ran 5:52 to fall back a little, but Benavides sped up, running 5:58 to move up a few spots. Eccles ran another 6:01, still gaining ground on some who went out too fast for their physical or mental ability.
    
    
                      
    
    In the third mile, Quinn opened up on the major hill with a 5:47 and put away the competition. Unfortunately, this may have had a negative affect on her teammates as they began to fall back with the hard move. Wicker managed a 6:04 mile, McVay a 6:09 and Gong a 6:10. Zeinstra's quad would not respond on the hill, causing her to slow to a 6:21. Benavides ran 6:16 and Eccles a 6:27 on the difficult hilly mile.
    
    
                      
    
    Quinn finished in first, setting the course record in 21:39, a nine second victory. Previously, only seven runners had ever broken 22:00 on the Williams course. Today there were six more and MIT had three of them. Wicker came back strong to finish fifth in 21:57 and McVay was sixth in 21:59. Gong regained focus to finished hard in 22:06 for eighth place. Zeinstra held on for 20th place in 22:32, Benavides was 26th in 22:42 and Eccles was 42nd in 23:03. This gave the women's team six All Region honors as well.
    
    
                      
    
    The amazing finish totaled 40 points, giving the Engineers their third regional title in the last six years, and this in the best region in the country.
    
    
                      
    
    Both the men's and women's teams will be traveling to Mason, Ohio next week where Wilmington College will host this year's NCAA Division III Championship.

    Women Place Third, Men Ninth at NEICAAA Championship
    
    
                      
    
    October 11, 2014
    
    
                      
    
    The weather helped, along with a very competitive field to produce outstanding cross country conditions at the NEICAAA Championship. With temperatures in the low 50's all day, a constant rain soaking the course, producing more and more mud as the races progressed through the day was perfect for cross country. This is the one race in the New England Cross Country season when all the teams in New England (Division I, II and III) get to compete against each in the same race, head to head. The combination of the two may not have produced the fastest times, but if you love cross country this was a great day.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT seized the opportunity, exhibiting excellent competitiveness in all four races (women's varsity, women's sub-varsity, men's varsity, men's sub-varsity). The women's varsity were hoping for nicer weather so they would have an opportunity to compare their performances with what Johns Hopkins (defending Division III NCAA Champion) ran on the course two weeks prior. However, in addition to the weather, both Maryann Gong '17 and Elaine McVay '15 came down with colds the past two days. Nicole Zeinstra '16 had also been ill and unable to eat well. However, the team showed their desire to be the best by not letting anything distract them from their goal. 
    
    
                      
    
    They received box 40, which put them on the far right. In fact they were so far right that they had to angle to the left to get into position for the first right hand turn less than 250 meters from the start. This course is not properly surveyed, so those on the right have a distinct disadvantage and must also keep from getting blocked out by the teams from the left positioning themselves for the right hand turn. The team got out very well across the rain soaked field, putting themselves in perfect position without wasting too much energy. At the 800 mark, Sarah Quinn '16 was a little fast at 2:46, but the rest of the team was right where they wanted to be between 2:50-2:55. 
    
    
                      
    
    At the mile mark, Quinn and Gong came through in 38th and 43rd respectively in 5:37 and 5:38, right on plan. Christina Wicker '17, McVay and Zeinstra were back in the mid 5:40's in about 100th place, while Cindy Huang '15 was around 140th at 5:52. At mile two they had maintained their effort, which had them passing many people who had gone out too fast for their ability. So many in fact that Quinn had moved up to 18th, Gong to 27th, Wicker to 34th, Zeinstra to 53rd, Huang to 55th and McVay to 65th. In the final mile and a tenth, Quinn moved a little too quickly, causing her calves to seize up and forcing her to slow quite a bit, fading back to 28th after moving up into the top 10. Gong had an excellent finish, closing to 12th in a new MIT record for Franklin Park at 18:02. Wicker moved up slightly from the two mile, finishing 31st in 18:17. Huang had the race of her life, finishing in 47th with a phenomenal 18:29, a full minute PR. McVay closed out the scoring, finishing 57th in 18:35 as she battled a strained anterior tibialis in addition to her cold. McVay is typically about 20 seconds faster on this course. Zeinstra was also close, placing 62nd in 18:38. This 36 second delta and incredible times highlighted the best performance in MIT history, placing them third among the 38 teams.
    
    
                      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, Liz Cox '18 led the way for Tech, finishing 11th in 19:02. Kali Benavides '15 was 17th in 19:07 and Mary Eccles was 33rd in 19:19. Also running a huge personal best was Ciera Gordon '18, finishing in 19:44.
    
    
                      
    
    By the time the men took to the course it was getting very muddy, particularly on the turns. It was going to be more difficult to make up ground, so a strong start was critical. Similar to the women, the men were on the far right, box 36. Unlike the women, the men did not heed the warning of getting out and pretty much got buried on the first turn, almost coming to a stand still. 
    
    
                      
    
    By the mile mark they were approximately 10 seconds too slow, which put them in a position that made it impossible to achieve their goal places or times. Spencer Wenck '15 led the way in 115th place. Matt Deyo '16, Benji Xie '15 and Colin Godwin '17 were within a few places. Back at around 160th were Rory Beyer '17, Allen Leung '15 and Cooper Sloan '18.
    
    
                      
    
    At the two mile mark the team moved up significantly. Wenck was still leading the way for the Engineers at 63rd place. Xie was in 86th, with Godwin and Deyo at 97th and 98th respectively. Beyer moved up the most, all the way to 107th with Sloan right behind in 109th. Leung was close behind at 118th. The third mile started catching up with Tech runners. Wenck continued to move up well, closing to 39th. Xie slowed his move through the ranks of opposing runners, but was still gaining ground at 67th place. Deyo moved up to 83rd, Beyer to 84th and Godwin to 86th. Leung slid up to 103rd, but Sloan fell back to 114th.
    
    
                      
    
    Xie had the most productive fourth mile, rebounding well to move up to 52nd. Wenck was not backing off either, continuing to blow past runners as he passed the four mile mark in 25th place. Deyo moved up four spots to 79th and Beyer stayed the same at 84th. Godwin lost two places, Leung moved up four and Sloan lost 15 as this is only his second 8K ever.
    
    
                      
    
    At the finish, Wenck ended up in 17th place in 24:58, moving almost 100 places in four miles. Xie finished in 41st in 25:15. Deyo placed 70th in 25:29. Godwin and Beyer were 84th and 86th respectively in 25:39 and 25:40 to close out the scoring for MIT. Leung was not far behind in 25:50 and Sloan refocused to finish in 26:04. The 298 points placed Tech ninth out of 39 teams and second among Division III teams, just seven points back of Middlebury. A reasonable start across the field would have placed the team in sixth as sixth place had just 51 fewer points.
    
    
                      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, Matt Jordan '15 made his return from injury a successful one as he led the team with a 17th place in 26:07. Also racing well were freshmen Ben Freed and Michael Picchini, running 26:14 and 26:15.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT will travel to Oshkosh, Wisconsin to race some of the top teams in the country. The women will be out to prove they are in contention for one of the top teams in NCAA DIII, while the men need to put a complete race together, which should prove to them and the rest of the country that they are a solid top 10 team in NCAA Division III.

    Wenck, Quinn Lead MIT Sweeps in NEWMAC Championship
    
    
                      
    
    November 1, 2014
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's Men's and Women's Cross Country teams traveled to Smith College with the intent on defending their New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Championship title and to extend their streak of consecutive NEWMAC titles to 17 for the men and eight for the women. Not only did the Engineers accomplish their goal, but won in dominating fashion by overwhelming their competition with sweeps in both races for perfect 15 point totals.
    
    
                      
    
    The men had not swept since the first year of the NEWMAC Championship back in 1998 and then it was only the top five places. This year's harrier version took the first seven places. The women had swept once, the previous time Smith hosted (2012) where Tech took the top eight places. This was certainly the first time both men and women had swept in the same year.
    
    
                      
    
    The #11 nationally ranked men were first off the line on the cold and windy day. The plan was to go out with reasonable aggressiveness on the somewhat hilly and winding first mile, hitting the mile mark between 5:15-5:20 and negative splitting the course from that point on, which was certainly a tall task. Spencer Wenck '15 took the lead and control of the race, splitting 5:12 at the mile mark. By the two mile mark, which contains a major hill, Wenck was with teammate Colin Godwin '17 in 10:27 with Matt Deyo '16 close behind. A WPI runner trailed Deyo with co-captain Benji Xie '15 right on his heels in 10:30. Rory Beyer '17 and Allen Leung '15 were very close to Xie in virtually the same time. Another WPI runner was just behind Leung with co-captain Matt Jordan '15 about three seconds back in 10:33 with Cooper Sloan '18 a second back. Then there was a pretty big gap as a few runners were strung out behind.
    
    
                      
    
    Watching this part of the race one could not help but think, could MIT really hold this pace. The third mile was flat and the Engineers were relentless, continuing to hammer the pace. Wenck ran 4:49 to come through three in 15:16, leading his teammates to what was now first through sixth places. Deyo, suffering from a cold and lack of sleep fell back to sixth and the first WPI runner fell back to seventh. Jordan had passed the second WPI runner to move into seventh overall. Cooper, feeling sick, fell back, ending the chance of a 1-8 sweep.
    
    
                      
    
    The second large hill is in the fourth mile. Although the pace slowed, the effort increased with Tech runners determined to put the hill away. Wenck threw down a 5:07 mile and the rest of MIT's top seven were between 5:08-5:18. The order was the same with the exception of Jordan moving into seventh place and widening the gap between him and his opponents.
    
    
                      
    
    The final mile was a reversal of the first mile, winding steep uphills through the woods followed by a downhill then flat final 600 meters. Wenck widened his gap with a 4:50 final mile as did his teammates who ran the final mile between 4:53 and 5:04 to secure the 1-7 sweep. The delta was a ridiculous low of 24 seconds through the top five and 40 seconds through seven. To put the quality of this effort into perspective, two years ago when MIT won, their top runner was Roy Wedge '14 in fourth place in 26:02 with better weather conditions. Jordan, Tech's seventh runner this year, finished in 25:53. MIT had four runners faster than the winning time from 2012.
    
    
                      
    
    In addition to the top seven, Cooper Sloan and Nicholas Waltman earned All Conference honors, finishing 12th and 14th respectively.
    
    
                      
    
    Spencer Wenck earned NEWMAC Runner of the Year, while Colin Godwin picked up the Rookie of the Year award.
    
    
                      
    
    By the time the women's race got underway the rain had begun to fall. There was a bit of concern in the air as tri-captain Elaine McVay '15 had difficulty sleeping the night before, tri-captain Cindy Huang '15 was unable to race due to a foot injury acquired during the week and Anna Frederich '18, preparing for her season debut, missed the bus.
    
    
                      
    
    Similar to the men, the #4 nationally ranked women were supposed to be a little aggressive at the mile mark and then increase their effort to run negative splits to the finish line. For some reason, the pace bogged down in the first half mile, with the leaders at 3:18. The Engineers finally broke away from the huge pack, getting to the mile mark in 6:15, about 15-20 seconds slower than was planned. Nicole Zeinstra, Kali Benavides '15, and Frederich (who got to the race about 40 minutes before the start of the race) were close behind at 6:20
    
    
                      
    
    At the second mile things had opened up quite a bit with Christina Wicker '17, tri-captain Sarah Quinn '16, McVay and Maryann Gong '17 leading the way at 12:18. Nicole Zeinstra '16 ran a 6:00 mile to move within two seconds of the lead pack. Benavides and Frederich were unable to go with Zeinstra, falling back 16 seconds with the hill taking some of the speed away from the runners.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final mile the women really opened up with Quinn pulling away with a 5:30 mile to come through three miles in 17:48, finishing with the victory in 18:22. Wicker finished three seconds back in 18:25. McVay put her sleep worries aside and stepped up the way she always does, finishing in third in 18:31. Gong, not having her best race, still finished fourth in 18:37. Zeinstra did a marvelous job of running by herself, but always within sight of her teammates, finishing fifth in 18:41 to complete the sweep. 
    
    
                      
    
    The 19 second delta was amazing by any standards, given the pace of the race, particularly the final two miles and the weather conditions. Quinn took NEWMAC Runner of the Year with her victory.
    
    
                      
    
    Finishing sixth for MIT was Benavides in 15th place in 19:09. Mary Eccles '18 missed Rookie of the Year honors by :06 as she finished 19th in 19:24. Frederich was just behind in 20th place in 19:31.
    
    
                      
    
    The Engineers are off next weekend, next competing on November 15 at the NCAA Division III New England Regional Qualifier hosted by Williams College. The top two teams in each of the eight regions will automatically qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship on November 22 in Mason, Ohio. 16 at-large teams will be selected from all eight regions to complete the 32 team field.

    Women Win, Men Third at Purple Valley Classic
    
    
                      
    
    September 27, 2014
    
    
                      
    
    In their first intercollegiate race of the season, the Engineers traveled to Williamstown to take on 20+ teams from New England, New York and New Jersey in the annual Purple Valley Classic. The 8K for men and 6K for women were the longest cross country races ever for the many freshmen on the team and the 80 degree temperatures promised to take a toll on nearly everyone who entertained pushing the pace early.
    
    
                      
    
    The men raced first. Going into the meet there were six top 10 teams representing New England Division III with all earning a national ranking among the top 30 teams in the country. Williams was ranked sixth, MIT eighth, Colby 17th, Amherst 21st, Middlebury 29th and Tufts 30th. There was no shortage of competition. 
    
    
                      
    
    After a rather quick sprint across the field the pace settled nicely to a reasonably conservative pace, showing a respect for the course and the heat. The leaders came though the mile at 5:20 with Colby dominating the lead pack with six among the top ten and David Chelimo, a sophomore from Colby dictating the pace. Tech was poised nicely just off of Colby. Williams College runners were back a bit, displaying their experience with their home course.
    
    
                      
    
    At mile two, Colby runners fell off slightly while MIT moved up slightly, still yielding a Colby lead. Williams made a significant move with their top two runners, but the rest of their team moved up marginally in the pack. Mile three was more of the same with the exception of the Engineers now leading the race by a slight margin over Colby and the ever closing Ephs from Williams.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final two miles, which includes the second time up the "big" hill, Colby proved the tougher team as they improved slightly on their places from the three mile mark, led by individual winner Chelimo. Tech showed they were not mentally ready for the challenge, falling off from 58 points at mile three to 72 points at the finish. Williams three, four, five runners made a big push in the final two miles to overtake MIT for second place.
    
    
                      
    
    Spencer Wenck '15 led the way for MIT, placing 5th overall in 26:27. Colin Godwin '17 placed 10th, just six second behind his teammate. Matt Deyo '16 did a great job coming off a sprained ankle to place 11th, four seconds behind Godwin. Benji Xie '15 fell off the pace in the final mile, placing 18th and Michael Picchini '18 made a great comeback in mile five after losing focus in the third and fourth mile to finish 28th overall.
    
    
                      
    
    The women were up next and the temperature continued to rise. Also like the men, the women's field boasted many of the top teams in New England and even stronger representation with regard to national ranking. Williams, MIT and Middlebury, typically among the top five teams in the country at the NCAA Division III Championships each year, were once again ranked high. Williams was holding onto the number two position with MIT ranked fourth and Middlebury eighth. Also in attendance were 14th ranked Tufts and the 32nd ranked team from Amherst.
    
    
                      
    
    Just like the men, there was a strong sprint across the field, with the Engineers expending too much energy when it was not necessary. Unlike the men, the pace continued to be brisk as they hit the mile mark in 5:56. Although MIT was not leading the race, Sarah Quinn '16, Maryann Gong '17, Elaine McVay '15 and Christina Wicker '17 were immediately behind the leader.
    
    
                      
    
    During the second mile, the leader made a slight wrong turn despite a cyclist leading the way and McVay, Gong and Wicker followed for a couple of steps before turning back. This put Quinn at the lead, but as they hit mile two in 12:03 they were once again all together with teammate Nicole Zeinstra '16 right with them. Also in this pack were two runners from Tufts, two from Williams, one from Middlebury and one from Colby.
    
    
                      
    
    In the third mile, the women hit the hill for the one and only time right at the three mile mark. The ambitious first mile took its tolls on some of the Tech runners, but not enough to make a difference in the race. Quinn pulled away after the hill, running a respectable 4:06 for the final three quarters of a mile to finish the 6K in first place in 22:23. Gong let Quinn get away too much, putting on a strong kick too late to catch her, but closing the gap to only six seconds at the finish for second place. Zeinstra's more conservative first mile served her well as she finished third for the team in sixth place overall. McVay lost focus a bit after the hill, but stayed in contention to finish ninth overall. Wicker let the hill get to her, but made dramatic improvement in her focus prior to that. Losing 44 seconds to Quinn in the final 3/4 mile left her in 18th place overall. MIT won with 36 points to 65 for Middlebury, 95 for Tufts and 115 for Williams.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT will be off next week, but returns to action at the NEICAAA Championship on October 11 at Franklin Park, a race that is appropriately nicknamed the All New Englands as it pits all Division I, II and III teams against each other in  varsity and sub-varsity races.

    Quinn, Wenck Lead Engineers at UWO-AAE Invitational
    
    
                      
    
    October 18, 2014
    
    
                      
    
    MIT traveled to Oshkosh, WI this weekend to race many nationally ranked NCAA Division II and III teams in the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh / AAE Cross Country Invitational at the Lake Breeze Golf Course, the site of the 2015 NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship. In the women's field, the nationally ranked #1, #2, and #7 Division II teams, along with the #1, #4 (MIT), #6, #9, #12, #14, #19, #21, and #30 ranked teams for Division III joined the 42 total teams on the 45 degree, windy day on a very wet course. On the men's side, representing Division II were the #2, #8, #23, and #25 teams and for Division III, #1, #3, #11, #13, #14 (MIT), #16, #17, #21, #24, and #26 were among the 45 teams.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's women ran an even paced race on the 6K course, with the A group of Sarah Quinn '16, Elaine McVay '15, Maryann Gong '17 and Christina Wicker '17 going out in a conservative 5:47 first mile, well behind #1 ranked DIII team John's Hopkins top four, who were about seven to eight seconds faster. By the two mile mark, Quinn and McVay were together at 11:40, but Wicker and Gong had fallen back, not having their best day. Nicole Zeinstra '16, who had gone out with Cindy Huang '15, the heroine from last week for Tech, was moving forward nicely, joining Gong after miles of 5:55 and 5:52. Huang was not as prepared on this day and went out the back end of this race. Group C was represented by Kali Benavides '15, Laura Eccles '18 Liz Cox '18 and Stephanie Marzen '15 and Benavides, Eccles and Cox were running well together, coming through two miles at 12:08.
    
    
                      
    
    Johns Hopkins' runners were falling back, but MIT runners were not closing the ground quickly enough. At three miles Quinn was 17:27, separating herself from McVay by two seconds. Zeinstra had moved up to third for MIT at 17:39 with Gong and Wicker not too far behind. At the finish MIT was fourth overall and second among Division III teams with Quinn finishing 13th in 21:35, the fifth Division III runner. McVay was 19th in 21:44, Zeinstra 29th in 21:59, Gong 34th in 22:03 and Wicker 35th in 22:11. The 36 second delta was solid, but the gap between two and three was too large and not having anyone among the top five overall finishers is something the Engineers will have to correct. Johns Hopkins was third overall and first among DIII teams, 10 points ahead of MIT when just scoring the DIII teams. 
    
    
                      
    
    The men from MIT got out very well among the 600+ runners, establishing themselves in good position going into the first turn. Between there and the mile mark, Tech's B group did not move well enough to establish a strong enough position to be real competitive in the meet while the A group was exactly where they wanted to be. Spencer Wenck '15 joined the leaders by the mile mark, coming through in a perfect 4:55. Close behind in 4:59 were Colin Godwin '17, Matt Deyo '16, Rory Beyer '17, and Benji Xie '15. Group C was led by Cooper Sloan '18, and Matt Jordan '15, at 5:06 and Allen Leung '15 who had fallen at the start. Trailing the group was Ben Freed '18 and Michael Picchini '18, at 5:07.
    
    
                      
    
    Throughout the next two miles Wenck stayed with the leaders albeit toward the back of that elite group. Godwin and Deyo lost a little ground but were still within 15 seconds and looking strong. Xie, who had been close to Wenck at the two mile was back with Godwin and Deyo at three and going in the wrong direction. Leung had caught up to Cooper and Jordan by two miles and pulled slightly ahead at three. 
    
    
                      
    
    The fourth mile hurt the Engineers. Wenck continued to hit 5:00 miles, but Godwin and Beyer ran 5:13 and 5:15 respectively, while Beyer and Xie ran 5:23 and 5:24 miles. Leung continued to move up, now only a second behind Beyer. In the final mile, Wenck stayed strong with a 4:49 to finish in 15th in 24:50. Godwin finished 43rd in 25:20, Deyo 54th in 25:27, Beyer 89th in 25:47 and Xie holding on for 91st in 25:48 to close out the scoring. Leung was right behind at 25:49, Sloan 100th in 25:52 and Jordan 110th in 25:56. 
    
    
                      
    
    MIT placed seventh overall and third among Division III teams, only finishing behind #1 ranked North Central College and #3 ranked UW Eau Claire. They represented their ranking well, defeating some very good teams. The delta of 58 second 1-5 is too large, particularly the 30 second gap between one and two. The team could be a solid top eight team in Division III if they get a little more comfortable with running in discomfort by the time NCAA Division III Regional Qualifiers come around in four weeks.
    
    
                      
    
    Tech is off next weekend, competing again on Nov. 1 to defend their NEWMAC Conference Championship hosted at the Smith College cross country course.
