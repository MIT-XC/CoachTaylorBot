<P>October 23, 1999</P>

<P>MIT Men's Cross Country took a trip out to Grafton, Massachusetts
to run Tufts University in a very small invitational. Swarthmore
College made the trip up from Pennsylvania, but they were the only
other complete team to enter the meet. Tufts, recovering from early
season injuries, and running a smart race, held on to an early lead
to defeat Tech in a close race, 31 to 33, with Swarthmore pulling up
the rear with 67 points.</P>

<P>Tech, having defeated Tufts three times already this season,
including last week in the New England Championships, was not as
motivated as they should have been. Not helping with the motivational
factor was the fact that number 2 man, Ed Keehr, was being held back
due to a consistent pattern he has had with lack of sleep. Also,
number 5 runner, Phil Loiselle was held out for the second week in a
row as he recovers from a cold and minor leg injury.</P>

<P>Motivated or not, no MIT runner was complaining or running less
than their best. Dan Feldman burst out to an early lead on the cool
and very windy day. At the mile mark, there was a large group of
Tufts' runners following two Swarthmore runners very closely, who in
turn were far behind Feldman. MIT was in good position with the top
runners all between 5:04 and 5:16 for the first mile. </P>

<P>During the second mile, Chris McGuire moved up to 2nd place, :09
behind Dan. Sean Montgomery and Frank Johnston were :10 back behind
Chris. Moving into the 3rd mile Sean was just moving past a couple of
Tufts' runners to pull into 5th place overall. </P>

<P>At the 3 mile mark, Matt Lyons from Tufts, who had started the
race out slow, moved to the front of the chase group, about :20
behind Feldman. Shortly after that, Lyons passed McGuire and took
another Tufts runner and a Swarthmore runner with him, leaving
McGuire in 5th place and Montgomery in 6th. Just before the 4 mile
mark, Liyan Guo and Frank Johnston were making their move on Tufts
4th and 5th runners respectively.</P>

<P>As the runners went into the woods during the last mile, Feldman
reinjured his sprained ankle and slowed considerably, allowing Lyons
to catch up. McGuire was unable to catch the #2 Tufts man, but both
he and Montgomery were able to hold off the #3 Tufts man. Liyan was
making a serious challenge on 8th place, but was still in 9th with
300 meters to go. Johnston was right behind in 10th but lacking a
serious kick, was looking as though he might not be able to hold off
one runner each from Tufts and Swarthmore as they entered the final
straight.</P>

<P>Tufts finished better than MIT, and that was the meet. With the
exception of Guo, MIT runners got left behind with 300 meters to
go.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT heads to Mt. Holyoke to defend their NEWMAC
Championship against nationally ranked Coast Guard. Coach Taylor
feels the Tech harriers have not come close to fulfilling their
potential, and need to work on their sense of pride if they hope for
their season to last beyond November 13th.</P>
