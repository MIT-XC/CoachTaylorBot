VICTORY</B></FONT>

<P>September 4, 1999</P>

<P>On a day more suited for sitting in the shade, and sipping
lemonade, the MIT Alumni showed up at Franklin Park to take on the
Varsity in a 5 mile race under 85 degree temperatures and very humid
conditions.</P>

<P>Dan Feldman '02, took the lead at the start and never looked back.
Ethan Crain '95, Terry McNatt '87, Arnold Seto '96, Jim Garcia '80,
and Josh Feldman '96 ran together for the first mile (5:02),
separating themselves from the Varsity's second pack, and trying to
decide whether or not to go after Feldman.</P>

<P>Going into the 3rd mile, the Varsity front runners were supposed
to have closed the gap on the Alumni lead pack, but instead the gap
doubled to over 10 seconds, and the Varsity runners were beginning to
spread out. Meanwhile, Crain, McNatt, and Seto had formed a very
tight pack, working together to stay in front of the MIT second
group, but making the decision that catching Feldman was not to
happen on this day. Garcia had begun to fall back a bit, but was
still in 5th. Josh Feldman had also been falling off pace a bit and
had been caught by a couple Varsity members.</P>

<P>At the four mile mark, Dan Feldman had opened up over a 20 second
gap. However, also expanding their lead were the Alumni trio of
Crain, McNatt, and Seto. Ed Keehr 01, was making an effort to close
the gap, but could get no closer than 10 seconds. Liyan Guo '01, was
moving up to Garcia, and Phil Loiselle 01, Chris McGuire '00, and
Frank Johnston '00 were moving up to and past Josh Feldman, but it
did not look like it would be enough with the Alumni getting
2-3-4.</P>

<P>The Varsity made a valiant effort over the last 2 miles of the
race, but the Alumni did not fold. Overall, the Varsity showed that
they are ahead of last year in some respects, particularly pace
setting. Regardless, the delta of 1:46 from 1-5 is not going to net a
lot of victories. Runners 2-9 are going to have to step it up if the
Engineers are to return home next week from Saratoga, New York with
the Engineers Cup in hand.</P>

<P>Others competing for the Alumni were: Stephen Peckiconis, Mike
Piepergerdes '93, Rich Rosalez '98, Jon Tong '97, and Chuck Van Buren
'98, </P>
