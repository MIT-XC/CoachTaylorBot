<P>September 11, 1999</P>

<P>MIT's Men's Cross Country team traveled to Saratoga State Park in
New York, the home course for RPI, to participate in and defend the
<A HREF="eng.res.html">Engineer's Cup</A> this past Saturday. MIT has
not lost the cup since 1990, when Tech's top three runners were led
astray on WPI's course, causing their disqualification and MIT's
loss. Without number one runner Dan Feldman, who was observing Rosh
Hashanah along with three of his teammates, the other runners on the
team responded with a much improved race over last week, which
resulted in a lopsided victory with MIT having the low score of 23
points to RPI's 48, and WPI's 65.</P>

<P>Expecting the course to be nearly all grass and dirt trails, the
MIT team came prepared with their spikes. Unfortunately, the course
had nearly 1/2 mile of parking lots, concrete bridges, and roadways
to cross. Most of the Tech runners with recessed spikes took out
their spikes. Others either left their spikes in or ran in their
training flats. This was a lesson learned regarding bringing both
racing spikes and flats to each race. The humidity was certainly down
from the last two weeks, and even though the sun was high and hot,
the MIT runners were ready to get started.</P>

<P>Eric Worhunsky of RPI took the pace out hard on the hilly course.
Ed Keehr '01, grew impatient and broke from the race plan to cover
the distance between Worhunsky and MIT's chase group. At mile one
(5:20), Ed was only :03 back, but the remainder of Ed's group (Liyan
Guo '01, Phil Loiselle '01, and Chris McGuire '00) was all spread out
2-4 seconds back, mixed in with a couple RPI runners and one WPI
runner. The remaining MIT groups were sticking to their plan, running
a good pace, and working together in groups.</P>

<P>At mile 2, Ed was still behind but closing. MIT's lead group was
still in disarray but beginning to regroup it seemed. Sean Montgomery
'01, was beginning to make a move from his group to try and come and
help the struggling lead group. Sean Nolan '03, and Frank Johnston
'00, were also making a move but were a little over :20 back
already.</P>

<P>Mile 3, which was a repeat of mile 1, saw Keehr sprint to the lead
and take command of the race. Montgomery was now with the chase group
of Guo, Loiselle, and one runner from both RPI and WPI. McGuire was
not having a good race and was falling back more each mile. Nolan and
Johnston were not gaining on the lead group but they had caught up to
all opposing runners in-between.</P>

<P>Mile 4, repeating mile 2, saw very little change. Duane Crammond
from RPI made a break at the 4 mile mark from Guo and Loiselle in an
attempt to catch Montgomery, who was trying to catch Worhunsky. Keehr
had opened up a 100 meter lead at this point and was home free.</P>

<P>Ed finished with a fine time of 26:53, winning by 13 seconds.
Montgomery came in third, and was followed by Guo in 5th and Loiselle
in 6th. Nolan, Johnston, and McGuire finished 8-9-10 respectively to
finish out MIT's top 7.</P>

<P>Others running well were Kenny Walker '01, Mark Jeunnette '01,
George Hanson '03, Stanley Hu '00, David Bailey '02, Reid Andersen
'01, and Alan Raphael '02. All these runners nearly equaled or
bettered their time from last week's easier and slightly shorter
course.</P>

<P>Next week the Engineers travel to Maine to take on Bates and Tufts
on Bates home course.</P>
