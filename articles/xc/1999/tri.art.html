and Tufts</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>September 18, 1999</P>

<P>MIT made the trip to Lewiston, Maine on Saturday with high hopes
of winning the Bates, Tufts, MIT triangular meet for the third year
in a row. Realistically, the Engineers did not have a good chance of
defeating Tufts, and only a slim one of defeating Bates, but the MIT
harriers went into the race to do their best to upend the nationally
ranked teams (12th and 19th respectively).</P>

<P>In MIT's favor, the number 2 and 3 runners for Tufts, and the
number 3 runner for Bates were out with injuries. MIT was healthy and
took advantage of the injured squads with a hard fought, very close
battle, that went down to the very end as MIT came home with 40
points to 41 for Bates, and 44 for Tufts.</P>

<P>The course was extremely hilly, pretty wet, and a little long at
5.05 miles. the rain from Hurricane Floyd caused a course alteration
at the last minute, making it new to everyone. The first mile, even
though it had a lot of rolling hills, went out in a quick 5:03 for
the leaders, who were Mike Danahy of Bates, Matt Lyons of Tufts, and
Dan Feldman '02, from MIT. A couple of Bates runners followed
closely, and then a group of MIT, Tufts, and Bates runners trailed
between :13-:22 back. By mile two, the lead group of three had
expanded their lead to nearly :30 over the main pack. However, that
main pack had begun to make up ground on the two Bates runners.</P>

<P>At mile three, Danahy had pulled away from Feldman, and Dan pulled
away from Lyons. Ed Keehr '01, and Sean Montgomery '01, had nearly
caught up to All-American Miler, Matt Twiest from Bates in 4th
position, and were closely followed by one Bates and two Tufts'
runners, giving all teams three runners in the top 9. The third
group, consisting of two MIT runners (Phil Loiselle '01, and Liyan
Guo '01), two Bates runners, and two Tufts' runners were waging their
own battle. The one difference in MIT's favor was a group of three
runners (Frank Johnston '00, Chris McGuire '00, and Sean Nolan '03)
who were closing quickly on the other team's fourth and fifth
runners.</P>

<P>By mile four, Keehr and Twiest were pulling ahead of everyone else
to battle for 4th place. Montgomery and Loiselle were not catching
the #3 Tufts' and Bate's runners, but Johnston, Guo, McGuire, and
Nolan were pulling away from both team's 5th runner. Coaches always
tell their runners that one place could make a difference, and that
the 6th and 7th men can win the meet. Well, here was the often told
story coming true.</P>

<P>The finish did not change any. All three teams interchanged places
for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th runners. Through four runners, the score
was Bates 24, MIT, and Tufts 27. Johnston finished 5th for Tech, and
Guo, McGuire, and Nolan all finished ahead of both team's #5 runner,
securing the victory by 1 point over Bates.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT's plans to race in the Codfish Bowl at Franklin
Park have been detoured as the Ryder Cup has displaced the meet to
Tufts' course out in Grafton.</P>
