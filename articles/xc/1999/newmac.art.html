<P>October 30, 1999</P>

<P>Once again, MIT Men's Cross Country expected to have a difficult
battle with the Coast Guard Academy for the New England Women's and
Men's Athletic Conference Championship, and once again, MIT claimed
an overwhelming victory. Mt. Holyoke College hosted the 2nd annual
championship at the Ashley Reservoir. The mostly flat, but rocky, out
and back course was handled quite well by the Engineers.</P>

<P>Coast Guard went out to the front in a relatively slow first mile.
Dan Feldman accompanied the Bears, running cautiously with his
injured ankle taped heavily. Chris McGuire and Ed Keehr were :04
behind, watching the race develop.  Liyan Guo, Sean Montgomery, and
Frank Johnston were another :03 back, behind many Coast Guard
runners.</P>

<P>At the turn around, halfway through the race, MIT had moved
slightly ahead of Coast Guard. Feldman was in first by a comfortable
margin. Trailing Feldman were two Coast Guard runners, one of which
was All-American Mark Akus. About :06 behind them was McGuire,
followed closely by another Coast Guard runner. Another :08 back were
Guo, Johnston and Montgomery, and two Coast Guard runners, all
running together. The score at this point would have been 34-39. Even
with the use of a two-way radio at the 1 and 4 mile mark, it was
difficult to tell which team was pulling away at this point in the
race.</P>

<P>At the four mile mark, the race was well in hand for the
Engineers. McGuire had moved into a solid second place, and Keehr was
just passing Steeple Chase All-American Jeff Rasnake from Coast Guard
for third. Akus had fallen back, and Guo had moved into 5th. Johnston
was having a solid race in 11th place, in spite of spending nearly
the entire week in lab, missing significant amounts of sleep.
Montgomery was not having a good race and was :11 behind
Johnston.</P>

<P>Rasnake caught Keehr, but was unable to make up the ground on
McGuire. Once Feldman ran away from everyone, he took it easy to
protect his ankle on the rocky course and only finished :11 ahead of
McGuire, who cut down on the margin by having an outstanding race
himself. Keehr finished 4th and Guo remained in 5th. Montgomery
rallied in the final mile to pass Johnston and end up in 9th position
to round out the scoring for Tech. Johnston stayed in 12th and once
again had the best paced race for MIT. Also defeating Coast Guard's
5th man, and every other team's 4th man or better, were freshmen
Chris Testa and Sean Nolan in 15th and 16th place.</P>

<P>It was a great race for MIT, finishing with a delta of :28 through
the first four runners, and 1:10 through seven. Coach Halston Taylor
still feels that MIT is not where they should be, and feels
significant improvement is needed if they are to make nationals in
two weeks when they race in the Regional Qualifier at UMass Dartmouth
on November 13. The top 5 teams, and top 7 individuals will qualify
for the NCAA Division III Championships in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.</P>
