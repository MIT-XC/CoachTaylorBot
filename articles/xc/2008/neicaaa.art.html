On the women's                   side, Jacqui Wentz '10, once again led the team with a new personal                   best at FP of 18:30 as she placed 29th overall in the NEICAAA                   Championship (all divisions in New England) out of 301 varsity                   runners to lead MIT to a 15th place finish out of the 45 teams                   and 6th among the division III teams. In the men's race, Hemu                   Arumugam '10, continued his team leading ways with a remarkable                   25:19. Arumugam, along with the return of a healthy Jake Ruzevick                   '09, (25:31), led the Engineers to a 12th place finish, and                   third among division III teams with 384 points.</p>                <p align="left"> The women ran first at 12:45. After being ranked                   in the top 12 in the country for the past three weeks, the Engineers                   had pretty high hopes despite missing two of their top seven.                   The unusually fast pace got to MIT as all of the Tech runners                   went from a strong first mile to a much slower second mile,                   anywhere from five to 25 seconds too slow. Wentz maintained                   a strong position up front while Andrea Bradshaw '09, moved                   from sixth position on the team up to fourth. Freshman, Janice                   O'Brien also moved up well. However, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11,                   fell back, as did Elizabeth Finn '09, Alicia Kaestli '12, and                   Adrienne Bolger '09. By the end of the third mile the women                   were much more competitive. Wentz through in a 5:55 final mile                   and had an outstanding kick to hold onto her position. All but                   Bolger came back strong, but the second mile did them in as                   they were only four points away from 13th place, which would                   have placed them ahead of two more division III teams.</p>                <p align="left">Wentz's time made her the second fastest MIT runner                   all-time at Franklin Park. Bradshaw's time of 19:19 was the                   10th fastest all-time on the MIT list with O'Brien being the                   12th fastest at 19:25 and Holt-Gosselin the 13th fastest runner                   in MIT history with her time of 19:28. Running well in the women's                   sub-varsity race were Katherine Eve '12, in 19:43 and Tania                   Morimoto '12, in 19:50, giving MIT nine women under 20:00 while                   missing three others who have also broken 20:00 in the past.</p>                <p align="left">In the men's race, Ruzevick took things out for                   MIT, coming through the first mile in 4:50 with Yermie Cohen                   '09, right behind him. Uncharacteristically, Arumugam went out                   strong in 4:56 along with Paul Welle '11. Just behind them between                   4:58 and 5:00 were Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, and Dan Harper                   '12. In the second mile, Arumugam moved up quite a lot as did                   Ruzevick, Welle and Cohen. During the third mile Cohen fell                   off the pace but Arumugam through in a 5:08 mile, which brought                   him within seven seconds of Ruzevick while Welle held strong                   with a 5:15 for a 15:34 split at three miles. In the fourth                   mile Welle fell off just a little but still looked strong. Arumugam                   caught Ruzevick right at the four mile mark at 20:35. The final                   mile saw Arumugam move up 10 places as he hammered home a 4:33                   on the slightly short last segment of the race. Ruzevick finished                   strong with a 4:56, which cost him about seven places. All but                   Cohen finished strong, which moved MIT up a couple of places                   in the team standings.</p>                <p align="left">Welle finished in 26:05, Amarasiriwardena in 26:18,                   Cohen in 26:29 and Harper at 26:30. Chris Wong 'G, also in the                   varsity race, started the race somewhat conservatively and was                   unable to move up significantly, finishing at 26:46. Racing                   well in the sub-varsity race were Trevor Rundell '09, ran 26:22                   and Richard Prevost '11, finished in 26:23. Both would have                   finished ahead of Cohen in the varsity race.</p>                <p align="left"> Next week MIT heads west to Williamstown for                   the Plansky Invitational, their final race before the NEWMAC                   Conference Championship.</p>                <p><br>                </p>              </div></td>          </tr>          <tr>             <td>&nbsp;</td>            <td>&nbsp;</td>          </tr>        </table></td>    </tr>  </table>  </div></body></html>
