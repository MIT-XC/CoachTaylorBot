Greylock High School,                   to run the course on which the NCAA Division III Regional qualifying                   race will be run and to race the competition from the region                   as well as a few colleges from outside the region such as College                   of New Jersey. The weather provided a perfect 55 degree, sunny                   day, which MIT gladly took advantage of as both women and men                   claimed victories in the 6K and 8K races respectively.</p>                <p align="left"> The women ran first, and even though Adrienne                   Bolger and Katy Gordon were not running, Jennifer Doyle rejoined                   those racing after a bout with an IT band inflammation. Jacqui                   Wentz went out conservatively in the first mile but steadily                   moved up in that first mile to sixth and eventually finishing                   fourth with a fine time of 23:06 on the hilly course. Finishing                   second for MIT was Anna Holt-Gosselin, who moved up to seventh                   place by the end of the first mile and maintained that position                   throughout the rest of the race, finishing with a time of 23:26.                   Jennifer Doyle, running her typical come from behind race, was                   only in 17th position at the mile mark, but finished in ninth                   in 23:32. Andrea Bradshaw, a converted 800 runner, participating                   in her first cross country season held onto 11th place from                   the first mile on, finishing one second behind Doyle in 23:33.                   Completing the scoring for the Engineers was freshman Janice                   O'Brien, who ran a very tough race, running in step with Bradshaw                   throughout the first three miles. O'Brien faded a little in                   final three quarters of a mile to finish in 13th place with                   a time of 23:39. Fellow freshman, Alicia Kaestli was sixth for                   MIT in 23:56 and Elizabeth Finn, a national qualifier last year,                   completed the top seven with a 24:00 performance.</p>                <p align="left"> MIT's 44 points, outscored The College of New                   Jersey by 10 points even though MIT put seven runners ahead                   of C of NJ's seventh runner. Tufts was in third with 56 points,                   led by individual winner, Stephanie McNamara in 22:17. All together                   eight teams competed in the race.</p>                <p align="left"> The men's race started very conservatively for                   the main pack, although Williams College alum, Neil Holtschulte                   and College of New Jersey's Christopher Guerriero took the pace                   out very hard. In the early going, the College of NJ had three                   runners considerably ahead of MIT's quartet of Jake Ruzevick,                   Paul Welle, Yermie Cohen and Hemu Arumugam. By the three mile                   mark the quartet had passed a Williams runner but were still                   five seconds behind the second and third C of NJ runners. At                   the four mile mark, Cohen tried to catch the two and partially                   succeeded, but eventually only caught one of them as he also                   was caught by Ruzevick and Welle, finishing fifth overall in                   26:41. Ruzevick made a dash at the end to claim third overall                   in 26:32. Welle was less than a second behind in 26:33. Arumugam                   fell off on the final big hill but managed to come back a little                   at the end and finish in eighth in 26:52. Trevor Rundell fell                   off the pace after the first mile but came back strong in the                   fifth mile to claim 11th overall and fifth for MIT. Richard                   Prevost finished in 12th, one second behind Rundell in 27:02                   to add support.<br>                  MIT claimed the team title with 31 points to 45 for the College                   of New Jersey and 62 for Tufts in the nine team field. MIT held                   out Dan Harper, Gihan Amarasiriwardena, Chris Wong and Bill                   Phipps, all who have been in the team's top seven.</p>                <p align="left"> Next for MIT is the NEWMAC Conference Championship                   on November 1 at Franklin Park. The men will be trying to upset                   a strong Coast Guard team to earn their 11th consecutive conference                   title. The women are trying to defend their title from 2007.                   The challenge will be a difficult one, but both teams are healthy                   and seem up to the task. </p>              </div></td>          </tr>          <tr>             <td>&nbsp;</td>            <td>&nbsp;</td>          </tr>        </table></td>    </tr>  </table>  </div></body></html>
