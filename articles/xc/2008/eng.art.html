With 80 degree temperatures and humid conditions,                   the lady Engineers nearly ran the table, missing a perfect score                   by one place, scoring 16 points to 51 for RPI and 72 for WPI.                   On the men's side of the competition the results were not quite                   as convincing as Tech has still not raced their top three runners,                   but nevertheless score 22 points to 45 for RPI and 71 for WPI.</p>                <p align="left">The women from MIT ran a conservative first mile,                   coming through in 6:10 with Jacqui Wentz '10, Andrea Bradshaw                   '09 and Jennifer Doyle '09 following a pair of RPI harriers                   and in the middle of a couple more. Following close behind the                   some more RPI runners, MIT's second pack of Elizabeth Finn '09,                   Katy Gordon '11 and Alicia Kaestli '12 came through in 6:15.                   By mile two Wentz had pulled away from everyone as Bradshaw                   and Doyle were unwilling to hold the pace. The previous leader                   from RPI, Erin Kyle, was still in second but MIT had solidified                   the next five places. By the end, Bradshaw (19:48), Finn (19:56)                   and Doyle (19:58) had moved past Kyle to earn a 1-4 finish led                   by Wentz in 19: 21 with Gordon (20:13) in sixth and Kaestli                   (20:23) in seventh. Four runners under 20:00 for the 5K this                   early in the season and in such conditions bodes well for the                   Engineers.</p>                <p align="left">The men went out much slower than planned, running                   15 seconds off of WPI's Kevin Jillson's 5:03 opening mile and                   behind a pack of five RPI runners. At the end of the second                   mile, Jillson still maintained a 15 second lead, but now only                   two RPI runners were ahead of six MIT runners, led by a pack                   of Hemagiri Arumugam '10, Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, Paul Welle                   '11 and Bill Phipps '10. Jillson fell off the pace during the                   third mile and Arumugam picked it up considerably, joining Jillson                   and Chris Donais from RPI in 16:10 at the three mile mark. While                   MIT owned the next three places, RPI had four runners within                   MIT's top eight with another three from RPI within striking                   distance. However, a strong fourth mile saw Arumugam open up                   a 10 second lead over Donais and Jillson with MIT claiming the                   next three positions and four of the next six positions. Arumugam                   won by 13 seconds with a time of 26:33. Amarasiriwardena (27:06),                   Welle (27:09), Phipps (27:12) and Kleinguetl '11 (27:17) claimed                   fourth through seventh to ice the victory.</p>                <p align="left">Next week, MIT travel to UMass Dartmouth for their                   first invitational of the season. It will be nice to see how                   well the Engineers handle the quality and depth of such a large                   field. The men' sub varsity race begins at 10:30, followed by                   the men's varsity at 11:15, women's varsity at 12:00 and women's                   sub varsity at 12:45.</p>                <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>                <p align="center" class="headline">&nbsp;</p>                </div></td>          </tr>          <tr>             <td>&nbsp;</td>            <td>&nbsp;</td>          </tr>        </table></td>    </tr>  </table>  </div></body></html>
