Minus their number four and five runners due to                   an IT band injury and a severe cold, the Engineers persevered                   over nationally ranked Bethel College and DePauw University                   by a mere two and 15 points respectively and the rest of the                   16 team field. </p>                <p align="left">On the hot and dry day with the sun blistering,                   the runners raced their first 6K of the season and were determined                   to win the race. Jacqui Wentz '10, led the way for Tech with                   an eighth place finish in 22:47. Following close behind were                   a trio of MIT runners, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11 in 13th in 23:05,                   Andrea Bradshaw '09, in 14th in 23:08 and Janice O'Brien '12,                   in 15th in 23:10. The fifth runner was freshman Tania Morimoto                   in 29th in 23:58. O'Brien and Morimoto were the second and third                   best freshmen in the entire field of 172 runners. </p>                <p align="left">Wentz and Holt-Gosselin pushed the pace from the                   beginning, coming through the first mile in 5:53. At the second                   mile, which Wentz and Holt-Gosselin came through in 11:59, O'Brien                   moved up to the duo with a great second mile to come through                   in 12:06. Fellow freshman, Alicia Kaestli also ran a great second                   mile, coming through in 12:12. Bradshaw and Morimoto were close                   behind in 12:18 and 12:23 respectively. The third mile took                   its toll on Kaestli and Morimoto, who fell back, but was great                   for Bradshaw, who moved up to fourth on the team. A strong finish                   by Wentz and Bradshaw was the difference in the race for first                   place. Katy Gordon, Tech's seventh runner two weeks ago while                   at full strength, battled injured calves for much of the race                   before having to back off in the final 800 meters. Adrienne                   Bolger, MIT's second runner two weeks ago, went out much too                   fast in the first 400 meters and paid dearly on the long course                   on such a hot day. </p>                <p align="left">The women who had a good race were able to run                   between six to nine seconds per mile slower than their best                   5K time on a flat course. Others allowed the heat, fast pace                   and extra distance get to them mentally. Despite some not having                   a good race and others being out, the Engineers found a way                   to win. </p>                <p align="left">On the men's side of the ledger, the desire to                   win the race was overcome by the need to survive for most on                   the team, ending in a disappointing sixth place finish with                   180 points in the 20 team field. Those who ran within a minute                   of their performance from the very flat UMass Dartmouth course                   competed reasonably well, but many on the team were near or                   over 1:30 slower than two weeks ago, a clear indication that                   they may have run hard, but never competed for the win. The                   lack of aggressiveness took them out of the race at the beginning.</p>                <p align="left">Hemu Arumugam '10, led the Engineers with a 12th                   place finish in 26:08. Arumugam started way back but had a mere                   :12 deviation between his fastest and slowest mile that moved                   him through the field. Jake Ruzevick '09, ran his first race                   of the year and competed well as he dusted off the competitive                   cobwebs. Ruzevick put himself in good position in the first                   and second mile, but grew cautious in the third and fourth mile                   before finishing strong to place 15th in 26:10. Freshman Dan                   Harper was the third freshman finisher in the race at 26:42                   in 38th place, but also lost a lot in the third and fourth miles.                   Yermie Cohen '09, competed very well in the first two miles,                   then backed off a little and got a side stitch, which caused                   him to lose a lot of ground. Grad. student, Chris Wong, ran                   his best race of the season as he came through as MIT's fifth                   man in 59th place in 27:01. Paul Welle '11, and Gihan Amarasiriwardena                   '11, let a series of negative thoughts prevent them from being                   aggressive at the early parts of the race and were unable to                   find it later as both suffered poor races.</p>                <p align="left">At this point, a very talented men's team needs                   to find their focus if they hope to reach their goal of defending                   their conference title in four weeks over a favored Coast Guard                   Academy and having a chance at making the NCAA Championship                   out of a very competitive region in six weeks. The women need                   to focus on continuing to get better as there is plenty of improvement                   to be had by the country's 10th ranked team. Next week, both                   teams get the opportunity to improve when they race in the All                   Division New England Championship at Franklin Park.</p>  </div></td>          </tr>          <tr>             <td>&nbsp;</td>            <td>&nbsp;</td>          </tr>        </table></td>    </tr>  </table>  </div></body></html>
