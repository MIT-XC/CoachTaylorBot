By the time the horn sounded for                   the start of the women's race it had begun to rain as New England                   felt the lingering effects of Gustav. When the men toed the                   starting line the rain had begun to come down hard, the course                   was a bit muddy and the wind was turning umbrellas inside out                   as well as slowing the runners down.</p>                <p align="left">Despite the best efforts of Erika Erickson '08,                   Hana Adaniya '07 and Alisha Schor '07, the alumnae did not have                   any other entrants in the race, thus were unable to score as                   a team. The varsity showed their talent and depth as only half                   of the team raced and still managed to sweep the top five places                   with a :13 delta. Sophomore Anna Holt-Gosselin led from start                   to finish, running a :34 PR on the Franklin Park course. Falling                   behind by 15 seconds at the three mile mark, Adrienne Bolger                   '09, made a dash for the finish over the final tenth of a mile,                   closing to within :04 to finish in 20:16. Following close behind                   were three freshmen, Janice O'Brien 20:22, Tania Morimoto 20:23                   and Katherine Eve 20:25, with Morimoto and Eve both showing                   strong kicks to the finish line.</p>                <p align="left">In the men's race, the &quot;has-beens&quot; brought                   together a formidable team. The varsity squad, showcasing many                   of the freshmen and trusting the skills of seniors Yermie Cohen                   and Chris Wong to lead the way, was severely over matched as                   the alumni won by a decisive score of 20-35. Fivos Constantinou                   '06, Eric Khatchadourian '06, and Ben Schmeckpeper '05, remembered                   their group running tactics, taking the lead at the start and                   controlled the pace of the race from start to finish. Constantinou                   pulled away during the third mile and never looked back, finishing                   in 26:58. Schmeckpeper, suffering a bad blister, had to back                   off but still managed a fifth place in 27:49. Khatchadourian                   held on well to give the alums a 1-2 finish in 27:26. Pulling                   up at the end, Joe Roy-Mayhew '08, passed Schmeckpeper at the                   finish in 27:48. Finishing the scoring for the alumni was Craig                   Wildman '03, in eighth place in 28:04. </p>                <p align="left">Freshman, Dan Harper was the only member of the                   varsity squad who seemed interested in trying to stop the alumni                   from running away with the meet. Harper valiantly tried to hold                   on, but saved too much during the third and fourth miles. He                   was able to drop a 4:59 final mile but was unable to make up                   enough ground to move up higher than his third place in 27:33.                   The varsity finished their scoring with Jack Bourbonnais '10,                   (27:53), in sixth, Michael Puncel '12, (28:04) in seventh, John                   LaColla '12, (28:16) in ninth and co-captain, Chris Wong '08,                   (28:23) placing 10th. </p>                <p align="left">Other alumni participating in the race, in order                   of finish, were Brian Jacokes '08, (28:37), Bob Collins '82,                   (29:12), Todd Rosenfield '01, (29:46), Josh Feldman '97, (29:48),                   Rocco Repetski '08, (30:15), Peter Mulligan '08, (31:32), Kevin                   DiGenova '07, (31:35), Mike Lyons '85, (34:56) and Don Shobrys                   '75, (34:56).</p>                <p align="left">Coach Taylor's comments regarding his team's efforts                   focused on the women learning how to run in groups, and for                   the men to just be competitive. Next week, MIT is at home against                   RPI and WPI in the annual Engineer's Cup at 1:00.</p>  <p><br>                </p>              </div></td>          </tr>          <tr>             <td>&nbsp;</td>            <td>&nbsp;</td>          </tr>        </table></td>    </tr>  </table>  </div></body></html>
