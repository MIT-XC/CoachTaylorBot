    **" HAS BEENS" SPANK THE VARSITY 
                      IN THE ANNUAL ALUMNI MEET**
    
    
                    
    
    September 6, 2008
    
    
                    
    
    It was an extremely muggy, hot day for the beginning 
                      of the annual Alumni/ae Meet. By the time the horn sounded for 
                      the start of the women's race it had begun to rain as New England 
                      felt the lingering effects of Gustav. When the men toed the 
                      starting line the rain had begun to come down hard, the course 
                      was a bit muddy and the wind was turning umbrellas inside out 
                      as well as slowing the runners down.
    
    
                    
    
    Despite the best efforts of Erika Erickson '08, 
                      Hana Adaniya '07 and Alisha Schor '07, the alumnae did not have 
                      any other entrants in the race, thus were unable to score as 
                      a team. The varsity showed their talent and depth as only half 
                      of the team raced and still managed to sweep the top five places 
                      with a :13 delta. Sophomore Anna Holt-Gosselin led from start 
                      to finish, running a :34 PR on the Franklin Park course. Falling 
                      behind by 15 seconds at the three mile mark, Adrienne Bolger 
                      '09, made a dash for the finish over the final tenth of a mile, 
                      closing to within :04 to finish in 20:16. Following close behind 
                      were three freshmen, Janice O'Brien 20:22, Tania Morimoto 20:23 
                      and Katherine Eve 20:25, with Morimoto and Eve both showing 
                      strong kicks to the finish line.
    
    
                    
    
    In the men's race, the "has-beens" brought 
                      together a formidable team. The varsity squad, showcasing many 
                      of the freshmen and trusting the skills of seniors Yermie Cohen 
                      and Chris Wong to lead the way, was severely over matched as 
                      the alumni won by a decisive score of 20-35. Fivos Constantinou 
                      '06, Eric Khatchadourian '06, and Ben Schmeckpeper '05, remembered 
                      their group running tactics, taking the lead at the start and 
                      controlled the pace of the race from start to finish. Constantinou 
                      pulled away during the third mile and never looked back, finishing 
                      in 26:58. Schmeckpeper, suffering a bad blister, had to back 
                      off but still managed a fifth place in 27:49. Khatchadourian 
                      held on well to give the alums a 1-2 finish in 27:26. Pulling 
                      up at the end, Joe Roy-Mayhew '08, passed Schmeckpeper at the 
                      finish in 27:48. Finishing the scoring for the alumni was Craig 
                      Wildman '03, in eighth place in 28:04. 
    
    
                    
    
    Freshman, Dan Harper was the only member of the 
                      varsity squad who seemed interested in trying to stop the alumni 
                      from running away with the meet. Harper valiantly tried to hold 
                      on, but saved too much during the third and fourth miles. He 
                      was able to drop a 4:59 final mile but was unable to make up 
                      enough ground to move up higher than his third place in 27:33. 
                      The varsity finished their scoring with Jack Bourbonnais '10, 
                      (27:53), in sixth, Michael Puncel '12, (28:04) in seventh, John 
                      LaColla '12, (28:16) in ninth and co-captain, Chris Wong '08, 
                      (28:23) placing 10th. 
    
    
                    
    
    Other alumni participating in the race, in order 
                      of finish, were Brian Jacokes '08, (28:37), Bob Collins '82, 
                      (29:12), Todd Rosenfield '01, (29:46), Josh Feldman '97, (29:48), 
                      Rocco Repetski '08, (30:15), Peter Mulligan '08, (31:32), Kevin 
                      DiGenova '07, (31:35), Mike Lyons '85, (34:56) and Don Shobrys 
                      '75, (34:56).
    
    
                    
    
    Coach Taylor's comments regarding his team's efforts 
                      focused on the women learning how to run in groups, and for 
                      the men to just be competitive. Next week, MIT is at home against 
                      RPI and WPI in the annual Engineer's Cup at 1:00.

    **MIT RETAINS POSSESSION OF ENGINEER'S 
                      CUP**
    
    
                    
    
    September 13, 2008
    
    
                    
    
    Racing most of the half of the team who did not 
                      race last week, MIT was still able to dominate the Engineer's 
                      Cup with convincing wins over RPI and WPI in both the men's 
                      and women's races. With 80 degree temperatures and humid conditions, 
                      the lady Engineers nearly ran the table, missing a perfect score 
                      by one place, scoring 16 points to 51 for RPI and 72 for WPI. 
                      On the men's side of the competition the results were not quite 
                      as convincing as Tech has still not raced their top three runners, 
                      but nevertheless score 22 points to 45 for RPI and 71 for WPI.
    
    
                    
    
    The women from MIT ran a conservative first mile, 
                      coming through in 6:10 with Jacqui Wentz '10, Andrea Bradshaw 
                      '09 and Jennifer Doyle '09 following a pair of RPI harriers 
                      and in the middle of a couple more. Following close behind the 
                      some more RPI runners, MIT's second pack of Elizabeth Finn '09, 
                      Katy Gordon '11 and Alicia Kaestli '12 came through in 6:15. 
                      By mile two Wentz had pulled away from everyone as Bradshaw 
                      and Doyle were unwilling to hold the pace. The previous leader 
                      from RPI, Erin Kyle, was still in second but MIT had solidified 
                      the next five places. By the end, Bradshaw (19:48), Finn (19:56) 
                      and Doyle (19:58) had moved past Kyle to earn a 1-4 finish led 
                      by Wentz in 19: 21 with Gordon (20:13) in sixth and Kaestli 
                      (20:23) in seventh. Four runners under 20:00 for the 5K this 
                      early in the season and in such conditions bodes well for the 
                      Engineers.
    
    
                    
    
    The men went out much slower than planned, running 
                      15 seconds off of WPI's Kevin Jillson's 5:03 opening mile and 
                      behind a pack of five RPI runners. At the end of the second 
                      mile, Jillson still maintained a 15 second lead, but now only 
                      two RPI runners were ahead of six MIT runners, led by a pack 
                      of Hemagiri Arumugam '10, Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, Paul Welle 
                      '11 and Bill Phipps '10. Jillson fell off the pace during the 
                      third mile and Arumugam picked it up considerably, joining Jillson 
                      and Chris Donais from RPI in 16:10 at the three mile mark. While 
                      MIT owned the next three places, RPI had four runners within 
                      MIT's top eight with another three from RPI within striking 
                      distance. However, a strong fourth mile saw Arumugam open up 
                      a 10 second lead over Donais and Jillson with MIT claiming the 
                      next three positions and four of the next six positions. Arumugam 
                      won by 13 seconds with a time of 26:33. Amarasiriwardena (27:06), 
                      Welle (27:09), Phipps (27:12) and Kleinguetl '11 (27:17) claimed 
                      fourth through seventh to ice the victory.
    
    
                    
    
    Next week, MIT travel to UMass Dartmouth for their 
                      first invitational of the season. It will be nice to see how 
                      well the Engineers handle the quality and depth of such a large 
                      field. The men' sub varsity race begins at 10:30, followed by 
                      the men's varsity at 11:15, women's varsity at 12:00 and women's 
                      sub varsity at 12:45.

    **WOMEN PLACE 10TH AT NCAA DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    November 22, 2008
    
    
      
    
     
    
    
      
    
    The Lady Harriers, at the "big show", the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship, for the first time, did not have stage fright. Indeed, they followed up last week's third place regional outing with an encore of placing 10th on the national stage with 354 points. Junior, Jacqui Wentz led the way as she has done all season, with a blistering personal best of 22:04 on the 6K course, averaging 5:55 per mile to place 54th overall.
    
    
      
    
    Instructed to get out fast to move into the top third of the 280 competitor / 32 team race and fight for every position, the team did just that. The top five were all out in the top 115 runners at the mile mark with splits ranging from 5:42 for Wentz to 5:51 for Anna Holt-Gosselin '11. By mile two, Wentz had solidified her position in the top 60 while Holt-Gosselin moved hard into second place for the team with a 5:57 second mile split. Jennifer Doyle '09, slowed down after a terrific first mile to move back to fifth on the team. Andrea Bradshaw '09, and Janice O'Brien '12, were only four and six seconds behind Holt-Gosselin, giving MIT a strong five just past the half-way point in the race. Katherine Eve '12 and Maria Monks '10, who was suffering from a lower leg injury, were having a difficult time moving up but were giving it all they had.
    
    
      
    
    In the last half of the race, Doyle again made her patented charge to the front. Even though everyone was slowing down, she was slowing down at a lesser rate, moving her past O'Brien and Bradshaw in the final three quarters of a mile to finish in a personal best of 22:35, the same time as Holt-Gosselin but two places behind her in 113 overall. Bradshaw was right behind in 120th in a PR of her own in 22:37. O'Brien faded a bit but also finished in a personal best of 22:53, earning her 150th position and closing out the scoring for MIT. After subtracting the individuals not on teams in the race gave MIT the score of 354, just three points out of ninth and a measly 44 points out of 5th, which would have put them on the awards stand.
    
    
      
    
    Given that the women had never before been to the national championship as a team, they performed brilliantly. A strong core of returning runners with national experience, combined with what appears to be a very exceptional recruiting class, could make the Engineers a regular at this prestigious event.

    **WOMEN PLACE 3RD IN REGION TO ADVANCE TO NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    November 15, 2008
    
    
      
    
    The NCAA Division III New England Regional course was already difficult at the hilly Mt. Greylock course, hosted by Williams College, but add rain on an already soaked course and high winds and you have a really challenging course. The women's team from MIT ran a strong race, battling the 330 runners from 49 teams for a third place finish with 161 points and a trip to the NCAA Division III Championship next weekend at Hanover, Indiana. The women placed three among the top 35 to earn all region honors; Jacqui Wentz in 19th, Andrea Bradshaw in 20th and Maria Monks in 29th. The men's team did not fare so well. Seeded fifth going into the race, the men did not follow the plan and had difficulty putting themselves into a position to race for one of the top team positions and a possible trip to Indiana. They finished a disappointing eighth place with only Yermie Cohen earning all region honors. 
    
    
      
    
    Wentz went out well in the first mile, in the back of the lead pack in 14th place, far removed from the first two runners, who came through the mile 18 seconds in front of the lead pack. Bradshaw and Anna Holt-Gosselin were about 10 seconds behind Wentz in 36th and 38th place respectively. Monks was back in 52nd place with Jennifer Doyle starting slowly in 64th place. By the two mile mark Wentz had faded back to 20th place, with two Amherst runners, including Elise Tropiano, the individual leader and eventual winner, two Colby and two Tufts runners ahead of her. Bradshaw and Monks were together at 25th and 26th position with one more Colby runner in front of them and another Tufts and Amherst runner behind them. Holt Gosselin and Janice O'Brien were in 44th and 45th places respectively, giving MIT a pretty solid group. However, two more Colby and Amherst runners were close behind and Doyle was in 64th place still and not looking very strong. At the three mile mark Wentz was still in 20th, and while she looked strong, she did not seem to have the attitude that she belonged among the elite and go catch either the two Colby or two Tufts runners. Bradshaw had moved up to 22nd, just passing the third Colby runner and second Amherst runner. Monks had fallen back to 35th, possibly losing a little focus in the third mile. Doyle finally began to move, passing runners to get into 51st place as Holt-Gosselin was fading, finding herself back in 57th position. In the final 3/4 of a mile, to assist Wentz, Bradshaw and Monks, Doyle moved up to 37th place while Holt-Gosselin "slowed the bleeding", willing herself to 56th place to give MIT a nine point lead over Colby, 13 over Amherst and 36 ahead of Tufts.
    
    
      
    
    The men were supposed to follow Williams College out from the start, and while they were following, with the exception of Jake Ruzevick in 10th place, they were 11 second off of the lead Williams trio and four seconds behind the sixth and seventh runners from Williams, back in 55th to 65th place. By mile two, Ruzevick had fallen back to 31st place, but Trevor Rundell moved up to 38th place and Hemu Arumugam and Yermie Cohen had moved to 42nd and 43rd places respectively. Gihan Amarasiriwardena was in 50th place but MIT was well behind team wise with Williams having six runners ahead of Ruzevick, Amherst putting five in front of Arumugam and Trinity with four in the top 20 and Brandeis closing in. There was still time to get the job done but a net forward movement through the pack did not continue. After four miles, Cohen had moved up to 32nd place and Arumugam to 34th but Rundell and Ruzevick had fallen back to 44th and 46th place respectively. Amarasiriwardena was now in 57th place while Williams, Amherst and Trinity were holding to their positions and Brandeis and Bowdoin Colleges were continuing to move up. These trends continued with Cohen finishing in 29th place while Arumugam placed 46th and Ruzevick holding onto 49th place. Amarasiriwardena moved up to 51st place and Richard Prevost moved up well to claim 52nd place to give MIT a total of 227 points.
    
    
      
    
    This will be the lady Engineer's first trip to nationals as a team and they hope to place among the first half of the 32 teams fighting it out for the NCAA title.

    MEN AND WOMEN SET MANY PERSONAL BESTS 
                      IN NEIAAA CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
                    
    
    October 11, 2008
    
    
                    
    
     On a sunny, 65 degree, beautiful fall day, MIT's 
                      men's and women's cross country teams set many individual personal 
                      bests on their home course at Franklin Park (FP), but still 
                      have to be a little less than satisfied, as neither team competed 
                      as well as they know they were capable of running. On the women's 
                      side, Jacqui Wentz '10, once again led the team with a new personal 
                      best at FP of 18:30 as she placed 29th overall in the NEICAAA 
                      Championship (all divisions in New England) out of 301 varsity 
                      runners to lead MIT to a 15th place finish out of the 45 teams 
                      and 6th among the division III teams. In the men's race, Hemu 
                      Arumugam '10, continued his team leading ways with a remarkable 
                      25:19. Arumugam, along with the return of a healthy Jake Ruzevick 
                      '09, (25:31), led the Engineers to a 12th place finish, and 
                      third among division III teams with 384 points.
    
    
                    
    
     The women ran first at 12:45. After being ranked 
                      in the top 12 in the country for the past three weeks, the Engineers 
                      had pretty high hopes despite missing two of their top seven. 
                      The unusually fast pace got to MIT as all of the Tech runners 
                      went from a strong first mile to a much slower second mile, 
                      anywhere from five to 25 seconds too slow. Wentz maintained 
                      a strong position up front while Andrea Bradshaw '09, moved 
                      from sixth position on the team up to fourth. Freshman, Janice 
                      O'Brien also moved up well. However, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, 
                      fell back, as did Elizabeth Finn '09, Alicia Kaestli '12, and 
                      Adrienne Bolger '09. By the end of the third mile the women 
                      were much more competitive. Wentz through in a 5:55 final mile 
                      and had an outstanding kick to hold onto her position. All but 
                      Bolger came back strong, but the second mile did them in as 
                      they were only four points away from 13th place, which would 
                      have placed them ahead of two more division III teams.
    
    
                    
    
    Wentz's time made her the second fastest MIT runner 
                      all-time at Franklin Park. Bradshaw's time of 19:19 was the 
                      10th fastest all-time on the MIT list with O'Brien being the 
                      12th fastest at 19:25 and Holt-Gosselin the 13th fastest runner 
                      in MIT history with her time of 19:28. Running well in the women's 
                      sub-varsity race were Katherine Eve '12, in 19:43 and Tania 
                      Morimoto '12, in 19:50, giving MIT nine women under 20:00 while 
                      missing three others who have also broken 20:00 in the past.
    
    
                    
    
    In the men's race, Ruzevick took things out for 
                      MIT, coming through the first mile in 4:50 with Yermie Cohen 
                      '09, right behind him. Uncharacteristically, Arumugam went out 
                      strong in 4:56 along with Paul Welle '11. Just behind them between 
                      4:58 and 5:00 were Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, and Dan Harper 
                      '12. In the second mile, Arumugam moved up quite a lot as did 
                      Ruzevick, Welle and Cohen. During the third mile Cohen fell 
                      off the pace but Arumugam through in a 5:08 mile, which brought 
                      him within seven seconds of Ruzevick while Welle held strong 
                      with a 5:15 for a 15:34 split at three miles. In the fourth 
                      mile Welle fell off just a little but still looked strong. Arumugam 
                      caught Ruzevick right at the four mile mark at 20:35. The final 
                      mile saw Arumugam move up 10 places as he hammered home a 4:33 
                      on the slightly short last segment of the race. Ruzevick finished 
                      strong with a 4:56, which cost him about seven places. All but 
                      Cohen finished strong, which moved MIT up a couple of places 
                      in the team standings.
    
    
                    
    
    Welle finished in 26:05, Amarasiriwardena in 26:18, 
                      Cohen in 26:29 and Harper at 26:30. Chris Wong 'G, also in the 
                      varsity race, started the race somewhat conservatively and was 
                      unable to move up significantly, finishing at 26:46. Racing 
                      well in the sub-varsity race were Trevor Rundell '09, ran 26:22 
                      and Richard Prevost '11, finished in 26:23. Both would have 
                      finished ahead of Cohen in the varsity race.
    
    
                    
    
     Next week MIT heads west to Williamstown for 
                      the Plansky Invitational, their final race before the NEWMAC

    MIT SWEEPS MEN'S AND WOMEN'S NEWMAC CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
      
    
    Wentz and Ruzevick Earn Runner of the Year Honors
    
    
        
    
    November 1, 2008
    
    
        
    
    The weather was a perfect 55 degrees and sunny and the Engineers took advantage by defending their NEWMAC Cross Country Championship at their home course at Franklin Park. The men raced first, defending their title successfully for the 10th consecutive time, winning their 11th championship in the 11 years the conference has been in existence. By the time the women ran the temperatures had risen near 60 degrees but it did not seem to heat up as much as the course due to the women's quick pace. The lady Engineers defended their title successfully, their fourth in 11 years.
    
    
        
    
    Coast Guard's men's team had defeated MIT soundly at the UMass Dartmouth Invitational early in the season and the Engineers knew the three seniors leading Coast Guard; Mike Haas, Mike Persun and Zach Hennighausen would be formidable opponents. What was not clear was how much support their teammates might be. For their part, MIT knew they had more depth, and if the pace was fast enough at the beginning, then the Tech runners would be able to take advantage and pack in the runners as the other teams fatigued.
    
    
        
    
    The pace was relatively quick with the first mile a crisp 4:56. Leading the way was Kevin Jillson, a senior from WPI. Following close behind were Coast Guard's three seniors, Mike Griffin from Springfield along with a teammate of his and the top three from MIT, Jake Ruzevick, Hemu Arumugam and Yermie Cohen. About three seconds back were six more Coast Guard runners, eight MIT harriers, one Babson College runner and two of Griffin's teammates.
    
    
        
    
    By mile two, MIT had made a big move and taken over the top three places with Haas and Persun right with them. Jillson had fallen back just behind Griffin. MIT put three more runners; Paul Welle, Trevor Rundell and Richard Prevost ahead of two Coast Guard runners and then the next eight of nine runners were from either MIT or Coast Guard, still making it either team's meet. By mile three the top six did not change but Griffin had begun to close on Cohen from MIT. Rundell and Welle moved up behind Griffin, and although Prevost had faded, freshman Andrew Erickson was coming on strong and had moved into 10th place. At the end of mile four it became obvious that Ruzevick was going to have a battle with Haas and Persun if he wanted to defend his individual title as all three came through at 20:38. Griffin had caught Cohen and was moving up on Arumugam. Rundell was still running strong, moving up on Cohen but Hennighausen was showing some fight as he went past Welle right at the four mile mark. Erickson fell back to 15th but Jack Bourbonnais moved up to 13th for Tech. The final mile, actually a little short of a mile, proved to be a good one for Ruzevick as he took the Coast Guard runners coming down Bear Cage Hill and sprinted to a three second victory in 25:25, defeating the other 117 runners. The places did not change much in the final mile with the exception of a strong move by Erickson moving back to 10th to earn Rookie of the Year honors, Bourbonnais moving up to 11th and Gihan Amarasiriwardena placing 13th to give MIT eight All Conference runners as they scored 28 points to 41 for Coast Guard.
    
    
        
    
    The women's race played out in very similar fashion as the men's. The pace however was a bit faster, relatively speaking. Amanda DiPaulo from Springfield, one of the individual favorites to win the race, took the pace out, coming through the mile in 5:49. MIT's Jacqui Wentz had just taken the lead although there was quite a pack with her. Nora Youngs from Smith, the defending champion was there as well as Amanda Rawson and Lauren Reddy from Wheaton, last year's second and third place finishers. In addition to a couple more Smith and Springfield runners, MIT's Janice O'Brien, Tania Morimoto, Alicia Kaestli and Anna Holt-Gosselin were also at 5:49 and only a couple of seconds back were Maria Monks, Andrea Bradshaw, Elizabeth Finn and Jennifer Doyle. It was nice to see the Engineers out so fast but there was also some concern with regard to them holding the pace.
    
    
        
    
    At the two mile mark, Wentz had put the hammer down and opened up a 10 second lead. Monks, running her first race of the season after recovering from a stress fracture that developed over the summer, made an aggressive move and passed DiPaulo with Reddy and Youngs closely behind. However, O'Brien, Bradshaw, Morimoto and Holt-Gosselin were in a line to solidify MIT's effort. In the third mile, en route to the 5K finish, Reddy caught DiPaulo and Monks, with Youngs passing Monks as well. However, Wentz now had a 13 second lead and Bradshaw, Katherine Eve, a freshman who moved up significantly in the third mile, Monks and O'Brien claimed fifth through eighth to close out the scoring before any other team was able to get their second runner across the line.
    
    
        
    
    Wentz won with a time of 18:28 to win Runner of the Year, defeating 111 other runners, with both Bradshaw and Eve breaking 19 minutes. Eve won Rookie of the Year honors. All 15 of MIT's runners finished before any other team's fifth runner to demonstrate how strong of a race the Engineers ran. Also earning All Conference were Holt-Gosselin in 10th, Doyle in 11th and Finn in 14th. 
    
    
        
    
    Both the men's and women's teams will head to Williams College in two weeks for the NCAA Division III New England Regional Championship and the opportunity to represent MIT and the region at the national championships the following weekend.

    ENGINEERS SWEEP PLANSKY INVITATIONAL 
                      VICTORIES
    
    
                    
    
     October 18, 2008
    
    
                    
    
     MIT traveled to Williams College for the Plansky 
                      Invitational, which is actually run at Mt. Greylock High School, 
                      to run the course on which the NCAA Division III Regional qualifying 
                      race will be run and to race the competition from the region 
                      as well as a few colleges from outside the region such as College 
                      of New Jersey. The weather provided a perfect 55 degree, sunny 
                      day, which MIT gladly took advantage of as both women and men 
                      claimed victories in the 6K and 8K races respectively.
    
    
                    
    
     The women ran first, and even though Adrienne 
                      Bolger and Katy Gordon were not running, Jennifer Doyle rejoined 
                      those racing after a bout with an IT band inflammation. Jacqui 
                      Wentz went out conservatively in the first mile but steadily 
                      moved up in that first mile to sixth and eventually finishing 
                      fourth with a fine time of 23:06 on the hilly course. Finishing 
                      second for MIT was Anna Holt-Gosselin, who moved up to seventh 
                      place by the end of the first mile and maintained that position 
                      throughout the rest of the race, finishing with a time of 23:26. 
                      Jennifer Doyle, running her typical come from behind race, was 
                      only in 17th position at the mile mark, but finished in ninth 
                      in 23:32. Andrea Bradshaw, a converted 800 runner, participating 
                      in her first cross country season held onto 11th place from 
                      the first mile on, finishing one second behind Doyle in 23:33. 
                      Completing the scoring for the Engineers was freshman Janice 
                      O'Brien, who ran a very tough race, running in step with Bradshaw 
                      throughout the first three miles. O'Brien faded a little in 
                      final three quarters of a mile to finish in 13th place with 
                      a time of 23:39. Fellow freshman, Alicia Kaestli was sixth for 
                      MIT in 23:56 and Elizabeth Finn, a national qualifier last year, 
                      completed the top seven with a 24:00 performance.
    
    
                    
    
     MIT's 44 points, outscored The College of New 
                      Jersey by 10 points even though MIT put seven runners ahead 
                      of C of NJ's seventh runner. Tufts was in third with 56 points, 
                      led by individual winner, Stephanie McNamara in 22:17. All together 
                      eight teams competed in the race.
    
    
                    
    
     The men's race started very conservatively for 
                      the main pack, although Williams College alum, Neil Holtschulte 
                      and College of New Jersey's Christopher Guerriero took the pace 
                      out very hard. In the early going, the College of NJ had three 
                      runners considerably ahead of MIT's quartet of Jake Ruzevick, 
                      Paul Welle, Yermie Cohen and Hemu Arumugam. By the three mile 
                      mark the quartet had passed a Williams runner but were still 
                      five seconds behind the second and third C of NJ runners. At 
                      the four mile mark, Cohen tried to catch the two and partially 
                      succeeded, but eventually only caught one of them as he also 
                      was caught by Ruzevick and Welle, finishing fifth overall in 
                      26:41. Ruzevick made a dash at the end to claim third overall 
                      in 26:32. Welle was less than a second behind in 26:33. Arumugam 
                      fell off on the final big hill but managed to come back a little 
                      at the end and finish in eighth in 26:52. Trevor Rundell fell 
                      off the pace after the first mile but came back strong in the 
                      fifth mile to claim 11th overall and fifth for MIT. Richard 
                      Prevost finished in 12th, one second behind Rundell in 27:02 
                      to add support.  
    
                      MIT claimed the team title with 31 points to 45 for the College 
                      of New Jersey and 62 for Tufts in the nine team field. MIT held 
                      out Dan Harper, Gihan Amarasiriwardena, Chris Wong and Bill 
                      Phipps, all who have been in the team's top seven.
    
    
                    
    
     Next for MIT is the NEWMAC Conference Championship 
                      on November 1 at Franklin Park. The men will be trying to upset 
                      a strong Coast Guard team to earn their 11th consecutive conference 
                      title. The women are trying to defend their title from 2007. 
                      The challenge will be a difficult one, but both teams are healthy 
                      and seem up to the task.

    **WOMEN WIN PRE-NATS DESPITE INJURIES 
                      AND ILLNESS**
    
    
                    
    
    October 4, 2008
    
    
                    
    
    The MIT Women's Cross Country team took their 
                      undefeated record to Hanover College, the site of the pre-nationals 
                      for Division III and left the site with their undefeated record 
                      still intact. Minus their number four and five runners due to 
                      an IT band injury and a severe cold, the Engineers persevered 
                      over nationally ranked Bethel College and DePauw University 
                      by a mere two and 15 points respectively and the rest of the 
                      16 team field. 
    
    
                    
    
    On the hot and dry day with the sun blistering, 
                      the runners raced their first 6K of the season and were determined 
                      to win the race. Jacqui Wentz '10, led the way for Tech with 
                      an eighth place finish in 22:47. Following close behind were 
                      a trio of MIT runners, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11 in 13th in 23:05, 
                      Andrea Bradshaw '09, in 14th in 23:08 and Janice O'Brien '12, 
                      in 15th in 23:10. The fifth runner was freshman Tania Morimoto 
                      in 29th in 23:58. O'Brien and Morimoto were the second and third 
                      best freshmen in the entire field of 172 runners. 
    
    
                    
    
    Wentz and Holt-Gosselin pushed the pace from the 
                      beginning, coming through the first mile in 5:53. At the second 
                      mile, which Wentz and Holt-Gosselin came through in 11:59, O'Brien 
                      moved up to the duo with a great second mile to come through 
                      in 12:06. Fellow freshman, Alicia Kaestli also ran a great second 
                      mile, coming through in 12:12. Bradshaw and Morimoto were close 
                      behind in 12:18 and 12:23 respectively. The third mile took 
                      its toll on Kaestli and Morimoto, who fell back, but was great 
                      for Bradshaw, who moved up to fourth on the team. A strong finish 
                      by Wentz and Bradshaw was the difference in the race for first 
                      place. Katy Gordon, Tech's seventh runner two weeks ago while 
                      at full strength, battled injured calves for much of the race 
                      before having to back off in the final 800 meters. Adrienne 
                      Bolger, MIT's second runner two weeks ago, went out much too 
                      fast in the first 400 meters and paid dearly on the long course 
                      on such a hot day. 
    
    
                    
    
    The women who had a good race were able to run 
                      between six to nine seconds per mile slower than their best 
                      5K time on a flat course. Others allowed the heat, fast pace 
                      and extra distance get to them mentally. Despite some not having 
                      a good race and others being out, the Engineers found a way 
                      to win. 
    
    
                    
    
    On the men's side of the ledger, the desire to 
                      win the race was overcome by the need to survive for most on 
                      the team, ending in a disappointing sixth place finish with 
                      180 points in the 20 team field. Those who ran within a minute 
                      of their performance from the very flat UMass Dartmouth course 
                      competed reasonably well, but many on the team were near or 
                      over 1:30 slower than two weeks ago, a clear indication that 
                      they may have run hard, but never competed for the win. The 
                      lack of aggressiveness took them out of the race at the beginning.
    
    
                    
    
    Hemu Arumugam '10, led the Engineers with a 12th 
                      place finish in 26:08. Arumugam started way back but had a mere 
                      :12 deviation between his fastest and slowest mile that moved 
                      him through the field. Jake Ruzevick '09, ran his first race 
                      of the year and competed well as he dusted off the competitive 
                      cobwebs. Ruzevick put himself in good position in the first 
                      and second mile, but grew cautious in the third and fourth mile 
                      before finishing strong to place 15th in 26:10. Freshman Dan 
                      Harper was the third freshman finisher in the race at 26:42 
                      in 38th place, but also lost a lot in the third and fourth miles. 
                      Yermie Cohen '09, competed very well in the first two miles, 
                      then backed off a little and got a side stitch, which caused 
                      him to lose a lot of ground. Grad. student, Chris Wong, ran 
                      his best race of the season as he came through as MIT's fifth 
                      man in 59th place in 27:01. Paul Welle '11, and Gihan Amarasiriwardena 
                      '11, let a series of negative thoughts prevent them from being 
                      aggressive at the early parts of the race and were unable to 
                      find it later as both suffered poor races.
    
    
                    
    
    At this point, a very talented men's team needs 
                      to find their focus if they hope to reach their goal of defending 
                      their conference title in four weeks over a favored Coast Guard 
                      Academy and having a chance at making the NCAA Championship 
                      out of a very competitive region in six weeks. The women need 
                      to focus on continuing to get better as there is plenty of improvement 
                      to be had by the country's 10th ranked team. Next week, both 
                      teams get the opportunity to improve when they race in the All 
                      Division New England Championship at Franklin Park.

    September 20, 2008
    
    
                      
    
    MIT entered the UMass 
                        Dartmouth Invitational intending to compete for the honors 
                        in each of the races, women's varsity and sub-varsity and 
                        men's varsity and sub-varsity. Not only did the Engineers 
                        compete for the victories, but they walked away, make that 
                        ran away, with three of the four races, totally dominating 
                        both sub-varsity races and the varsity women sneaking in ahead 
                        of NCAA Division III number one ranked, and defending national 
                        champion, Amherst for the victory. Only the varsity men were 
                        unable to gain the victory, settling for third behind Keene 
                        State and Coast Guard.
    
    
                      
    
    Race time temperatures were hovering in the 
                        low 70's but the sun was intense. The first race on the docket 
                        was the men's sub varsity race. The start of the race had 
                        Keene State up front with MIT mixed in and a little behind 
                        as they came through the mile mark in a fairly quick 5:06. 
                        At the two mile mark, freshmen John LaColla and Andrew Erickson 
                        had taken over the lead and appeared on their way to victory. 
                        Perhaps the pace was a little quick for the rookies for the 
                        slight uphill grade in mile three took its toll on the freshmen. 
                        Senior co-captain, Chris Wong, moved up to fourth position 
                        at the four mile mark, followed closely by LaColla and Trevor 
                        Rundell '09. MIT continued to move up spots as Keene State 
                        continued to fade. At the finish Wong maintained his fourth 
                        place in 26:11 while LaColla moved up to seventh in 26:15. 
                        Rundell held onto ninth in 26:19 while Erickson came back 
                        to claim 10th in 26:26. Sophomore Richard Prevost finished 
                        in 11th at 26:28 to give MIT a commanding victory among the 
                        20 teams with 41 points.
    
    
                      
    
    In the men's varsity race, MIT was running without 
                        number one runner, Jake Ruzevick '09, but was nevertheless 
                        ready to do battle with some of the top New England Division 
                        III teams. There were 38 teams competing in the race with 
                        two division I teams and two division II teams. The pace was 
                        relatively slow on the flat course, coming through the mile 
                        in 5:04. MIT was in good shape with Paul Welle '11 in fourth 
                        and Yermie Cohen '09 in 5th as well as Gihan Amarasiriwardena 
                        '11in 23rd, Dan Harper '12 in 27th, Bill Phipps '10 in 35th, 
                        Kevin Kleinguetl '11 in 45th and Hemu Arumugam '10 in 56th 
                        position. By the two mile mark the leaders came through in 
                        10:14 and MIT runners were bunched between sixth and thirty 
                        fifth place, but Coast Guard was bunched up in front of MIT 
                        and Keene State was uncharacteristically moving up from behind. 
                        The third and fourth miles were not good to MIT as Cohen and 
                        Welle faded a bit. Arumugam moved up well and eventually captured 
                        13th place in 25:25. Welle held on to 19th in 25:32, Cohen 
                        continued to lose ground but finished in 25th place in 25:34, 
                        Amarasiriwardena was right behind in 27th place in 25:36 and 
                        Dan Harper came back after losing focus in the previous two 
                        miles to claim 34th in 25:49. The 118 points placed MIT three 
                        points behind conference rival Coast Guard in third place. 
                        Winner Keene State easily won with 85 points.
    
    
                      
    
    Next, the varsity women took to the starting 
                        line. 41 teams toed the line with defending national champion 
                        the headliner. At the mile mark, Jacqui Wentz '10 led the 
                        way for MIT in seventh place in 5:48 with Adrienne Bolger 
                        '09 in 16th position, Katy Gordon '11 in 20th, Anna Holt-Gosselin 
                        in 25th and Jennifer Doyle '09 in 36th. Amherst College runners 
                        were bunched between 45th and 55th place, appearing to just 
                        cruise the early part of the race. By mile two MIT had moved 
                        up to third, 10th, 11th 14th, 25th, 27th and 29th place. Amherst's 
                        entire group was right behind in 30th-36th place. At the finish 
                        MIT held on for the victory despite the fast closing Amherst 
                        runners. Wentz finished fourth overall in 18:30. She was followed 
                        by Bolger in 12th in 18:44, Holt-Gosselin in 15th in 18:51, 
                        Jennifer Doyle in 18th in 18:54 and Andrea Bradshaw '09, a 
                        rookie to cross country, in 18:57 for 23rd place. Amherst 
                        moved up significantly, claiming second, ninth, 10th and 19th 
                        but their number five runner faded to 53rd. 
    
    
                      
    
    The final race of the day was the women's sub-varsity 
                        race. This race held no surprises as MIT went out into the 
                        lead and kept it. Alicia Kaestli '12 led until the two mile 
                        mark with a fine split of 12:10. She was followed by fellow 
                        freshman, Tania Morimoto in fourth place, another freshman, 
                        Katherine Eve in seventh and Liz Labuz '09 in eighth. Amherst 
                        College was coming on strong to challenge MIT but was unsuccessful. 
                        At the finish, Kaestli fell back to third in 19:19, while 
                        Morimoto got nipped at the line to finish in fourth in 19:26. 
                        Eve was right behind in fifth in 19:29 and Labuz holding on 
                        for 12th in 19:47 and freshman Maggie Lloyd finishing strong 
                        for 13th place in 19:49. The final score was MIT 35 to 50 
                        for Amherst in the 18 team field.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT will travel to Williams College 
                        to see the course that will be host to the NCAA Regional Qualifier. 
                        The pre-national meet will be in two weeks and those making 
                        that trip will not race at Williams, giving them a much needed 
                        break from racing.
