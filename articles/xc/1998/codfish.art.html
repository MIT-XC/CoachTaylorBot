CODFISH BOWL VICTORY</B></FONT>

<P>&nbsp;</P></CENTER>

<P>SEPTEMBER 26, 1998</P>

<P>The Men's Cross Country Team took their undefeated record to
Franklin Park this weekend to run the 31st Annual Codfish Bowl.
Running a solid race from front to back, MIT ran past 15 teams with a
low score of 55 points to take the victory and remain undefeated.</P>

<P>The first invitational of the year proved to have a much faster
start than any of MIT's previous meets. The lead group ran through
the mile mark in 4:52. Bates and UMass/Lowell seemed to be the front
runners with both teams having 7 runners ahead of MIT's 4th man,
although MIT did have 3 runners in the front group (Mark Strauss '01,
Mike Parkins '99, and Dan Feldman '02).</P>

<P>Things did not change much during the more difficult 2nd mile. The
leaders pack was down to 5 as they came through the 2 mile mark in
10:11, with Feldman giving close chase. However, MIT, while running
in nice groups, had not closed much on Bates.</P>

<P>The third mile was more in Tech's favor. Strauss and Parkins
maintained close contact with the leaders as they came through in
15:20. Feldman fell back by 10 seconds, but no one was catching him.
A pack of MIT runners (Ed Keehr '01, Phil Loiselle '01, and Frank
Johnston '00) had broken up Bates main pack and was only 26 seconds
behind Feldman.</P>

<P>In the 4th mile, Robert Mitchell of Amherst broke away from the
lead pack and Gary Mello of Bentley was close behind. Strauss and
Parkins were giving chase but not making much headway. Feldman had
fallen back by 10 more seconds and Keehr, Loiselle, and Johnston had
maintained their distance while continuing to catch those opponents
who were fading.</P>

<P>Little changed in the final mile except for the amazing charge of
Sean Montgomery '01. Sean, a half-miler with a great sense of pace,
and little desire to go out too fast, ran a 4:46 final mile (faster
than everyone except Strauss) and caught 15 runners. Sean ended up as
the 7th man in 32nd place with a 26:46. Feldman finished in 10th,
Keehr in 16th, and Loiselle in 22nd to give MIT the winning score.
Overall, 21 of 22 runners ran season bests.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT travel to Babson to test the National Qualifying
course in the Babson Invitational. Last year's number 2 man, Chris
McGuire hopes to run his first race this week as he continues to
rehabilitate from a knee injury.</P>
