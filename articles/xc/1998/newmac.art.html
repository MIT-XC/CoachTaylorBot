<P>October 31, 1998</P>

<P>The Men's Cross Country Team made an early morning trip to the
Coast Guard Academy for the inaugural NEWMAC Cross Country
Championship today. Going into the meet as favorites, MIT, the 12th
ranked team in NCAA Division III, did not disappoint as they swept to
a perfect score of 15 points on the very hilly course.</P>

<P>The course, starting out on the athletic fields, and looping
around 1 1/2 times can give the uninitiated a false sense of what the
course is really like--flat it isn't. Knowing this, the Coast Guard
runners nevertheless took it out hard as they led the way to a first
mile of 5:00. Mark Strauss '01, Mike Parkins '99, and Dan Feldman
'02, were right on the two Coast Guard runners by the mile and half
mark. Right behind them were three more Coast Guard harriers again
followed by three MIT runners (Chris McGuire '00, Sean Montgomery
'01, and Phil Loiselle '01).</P>

<P>After some grueling hills in the narrow woods, MIT crossed the
three mile mark in total command of the race with Parkins well in
front, followed by Strauss and Feldman. McGuire, Montgomery, and
Loiselle were right behind the lone remaining Coastie in sight. After
a little more woods, the course returned to pavement and a very long
uphill route back to campus. The Tech runners were prepared for this
and thus the reason for the cautious first two miles.</P>

<P>Once back up on campus the course then turned downhill or the
final half mile. Parkins was led astray by a supposed course monitor
but realized his error in time to get back into second place. The
course finished around the cinder track and into the chute at the end
of the straightway. Strauss held onto the lead to earn NEWMAC runner
of the year and set a course record of 26:01. The previous record had
been held by MIT's own David Moyle '92, in 26:15. Parkins was :10
behind. Eleven seconds back in fourth was the NEWMAC rookie of the
year, Dan Feldman, with a 26:20. McGuire is nearly back to his old
form as he finished third, just :09 behind Parkins. Montgomery
completed the sweep by outkicking Michael Sharp of Coast Guard 26:26
to 26:28. Loiselle followed for 7th overall. Ed Keehr '01, was 10th
overall to put 7 MIT runners in the top 10, who all made
All-Conference.</P>
