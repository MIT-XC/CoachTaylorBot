</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>WITH VICTORY OVER TUFTS</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>October 24, 1998</P>

<P>MIT traveled to Grafton, MA for the last regular season contest
versus Tufts and UMass Boston. MIT came from behind to pull ahead in
the 4th mile and hold on for a 4 point victory, 26-30, over 12th
ranked Tufts. UMass Boston was overmatched, scoring 82 points.</P>

<P>Tufts had avenged an early season loss to MIT just last week with
a great effort in the all division New England Championships. In that
race, MIT had been taken out of their race plan with much too fast
early pace. This week Tech stuck to their plan and ran a well paced
race.</P>

<P>Tufts almost ran away with the race when Tufts' top runner, Matt
Lyons, ran hard to a sizable 1st mile lead as he came through in 5:03
on the challenging course, and was followed closely by two of his
teammates. Mike Parkins '99 was not far behind, along with Mark
Strauss '01, and Dan Feldman '02. Sean Montgomery '01, Phil Loiselle
'01, and Chris McGuire '00 trailed Tufts' 4-6 runners, and were far
enough behind to cause concern.</P>

<P>During the 2nd mile, the 2nd and 3rd Tufts' runners started fading
badly. Parkins had moved into 2nd place and Strauss and Feldman were
moving into position to catch Tufts' 2nd runner. Montgomery,
Loiselle, and McGuire had moved up to the 5th Tufts runner, who was
not letting them pass easily.</P>

<P>The 3rd mile, the slowest in the race, still had Parkins in 2nd
with Strauss and Feldman running just ahead of the Tuft's 2nd and 3rd
runners. Montgomery, Loiselle, and McGuire were closing on the 4th
Tufts runner and had put some distance between them and the Tufts 5th
man.</P>

<P>During the 4th mile, Montgomery made a big move going up the big
hill, moving past the Tufts 4th runner and began making his move on
Strauss and Feldman, who were still 16 seconds ahead at the 4 mile
mark. The Tufts runners who had gone out hard were obviously paying
for it, while those who had held back were coming on pretty strong.
It began to look like if MIT could hold on it would be because of the
plan to run even throughout the race.</P>

<P>In the last mile, Parkins held his position and eventually
finished 12 seconds behind Lyons for 2nd place. Montgomery caught
Feldman and Strauss but none of them could catch the 2nd Tufts
runner, who showed a very strong finish. Feldman kicked past
Montgomery for 4th and 5th with Strauss in 6th. Loiselle and McGuire
held on 9th and 10th, 8 seconds ahead of Tufts' 5th man to secure the
victory.</P>

<P>This victory gave MIT a 6-0 record in non-invitational meets, and
a near perfect invitational record, winning two and losing only to
Williams College in the third. Next week, MIT travels to Coast Guard
for the inaugural NEWMAC (New England Women's and Men's Athletic
Conference) Cross Country Championship.</P>
