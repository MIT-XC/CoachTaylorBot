INVITATIONAL WIN</B></FONT>

<P>&nbsp;</P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Oct. 3, 1998</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">MIT's Men's Cross Country Team ran in and won the
Babson Invitational on Saturday with a low score of 58 points. Led by
Captain Mike Parkins '99, and Mark Strauss '01, who finished 1st and
2nd, the Tech runners beat 26 other teams, including nationally
ranked Brandeis on this near perfect weather day.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Racing on a course other than Franklin Park for
the first time this season, MIT went out harder than usual so as not
to get caught on some of the narrow paths throughout the course.
However, Brandeis was out in front, with Coast Guard also among the
leaders. By the second mile, the lead group which include Parkins,
Strauss, and freshman Dan Feldman, had separated from the rest of the
pack and MIT's second group by 20 seconds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The third mile had the first real hill, a 150
meter, winding, low grade incline that did little to slow anyone
down. The lead group was only 6 by the end of the third mile with 1
Brandeis, 3 MIT, 1 Coast Guard, and 1 Bates runner. MIT was still
trailing Brandeis but not by much. The fourth mile again had the same
hill, and again the lead group did not slow down their pace over the
dusty, winding course. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">MIT's 4th runner, Phil Loiselle '01, had moved
ahead of Brandeis's 4th runner and Ed Keehr '01, was even with their
5th runner. The strength of Tech's lead group wrapped up the victory
as Feldman finished in 6th to support Parkins and Strauss. Loiselle
ended up in 20th with Keehr placing 31st.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">For the first time this season, the team was
broken up into Varsity and Sub-varsity sections. MIT was looking
forward to this opportunity because of their tremendous
depth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The inexperience at leading a race showed, but the
results were not affected as MIT finished in 1st with 21 points. Sean
Montgomery '01, led the way with his 1st place finish. Liyan Guo '01,
mirrored Parkins and Strauss's 1-2 finish by finishing 2nd in his
race. Supporting Montgomery and Guo were Jose Esparza '02, in 4th,
Jeff Billing '01, in 5th, and Ray Molnar '00, in 9th.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Overall, MIT had their top 9 runners within 1:50
of each other. Coach Halston Taylor thinks they can 14 runners within
2:00, and close the top 5 to within 1:00. MIT's next opportunity to
work toward this goal will be on October 10th at Dickinson College in
Pennsylvania to test out the National Championship course in the 2nd
of two National Preview Invitationals.</FONT></P>
