              <p style="font-size: 12px"><strong><span style="">TECH OPENS INTERCOLLEGIATE SEASON WITH DOMINANT VICTORY</span></strong></p>
              <p align="left">January 14, 2012 </p>
              <p align="left">Both the Men's and Women's teams representing MIT dominated their opponents from <a href="mittri.res.php">Bates and Colby Colleges</a> in the first intercollegiate meet of the 2012 indoor season for the Engineers. The men won five of six field events and 11 of 18 events overall to score 199 points to 116 for Bates and 64 for Colby. The women also won five of six field events and 11 of 18 events overall to earn the victory with 210 points to 88 for Bates and 80 for Colby.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT opened the meet with a dominant victory in the women's Mile Run. Louise van den Heuvel '14 took control of the race in the second half and blasted the last 400 in 76 seconds to win in 5:12.44. Marie Burkland '13 claimed second in 5:15.17, Elaine McVay '15 took third in 5:15.81 and Stephanie Marzen '15 placed fourth in 5:20.35. Claiming the first four of the six scoring places gave MIT a quick 19 points to two for Colby and one for Bates in the 7-5-4-3-2-1 scoring format.</p>
              <p align="left">Things did not get easier on the track for the visitors as Portia Jones '12 claimed the 55HH in a fine early season time of 8.40. She was supported by Jackie Brew '14 in third at 8.59 and Jackie Konopka '14 in fifth at 9.07. </p>
              <p align="left">A brief reprieve occurred in the 400, when due to the absence of Martha Gross '12 due to a minor knee irritation, Madeleine Bairey '15 was the lone representative for the Engineers. Bairey ran well, placing second in 63.92, but MIT only took five of the 22 available points.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT turned the heat back on in the 600 as Jamie Simmons '12 led start to finish, clocking a great early season time of 1:38.07. Freshman Cindy Huang ran a very respectable 1:42.74 for second place and Alexandra Taylor '14 returned to competition after a lower back injury, taking third place in 1:44.22.</p>
              <p align="left">Tech did not win the next event, the 55 Meter Dash, but they did take 2-3-4  by Jones, Brew and Veronica Szklarzewski '15, clocking 7.51, 7.52 and 7.75 respectively.</p>
              <p align="left">In the field, despite a core of experienced throwers, the Engineers still claimed the Shot Put victory as Kristine Bunker '14 exercised her pentathlon skills to throw a PR of 33-2. Fellow multi-eventer, Konopka took third in 30-9 and Ashley Wheeler '15 earned sixth with a put of 29-2 1/2.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT took another 1-2-3-4 sweep, when Preethi Vaidyanathan claimed both the freshman and varsity high jump records with a fine leap of 5-3 3/4. Earning second, and losing her varsity record of 5-3 1/4, which she held for one week, Bunker cleared 5-1 3/4. Szklarzewski took third at 4-11 3/4 and Konopka claimed fourth at 4-9 3/4.</p>
              <p align="left">In the Long Jump, Brew jumped 17-0 3/4 for first place and Konopka took second at 16-1 1/2. Michelle Johnson '15 added a fourth place at 15-10 1/2 and Stephanie Birkhimer '14 contributed with a sixth place at 14-9 1/4. Johnson returned in the Triple Jump to lead the Engineers to perhaps their best event of the day. Johnson jumped a personal best of 35-1 and Szklarzewski added a PR of her own for second place at 34-11 1/4. Brew was just behind in third at 34-11 and Birkhimer contributed with a fifth place 33-3 3/4.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT's signature event, the Pole Vault, was once again strong with Lauren Kuntz '13, leading the way. Kuntz claimed first place at 11-5 3/4 and was supported by Joanna Chen '15 at 10-6 for third, Marissa Engle '15 at 10-0 for fourth and Becca Greene '14 at 10-0 for fifth.</p>
              <p align="left">In the one field event the Engineers lost, the Weight Throw, Freshmen Ashley Wheeler and Ellen Liverpool, threw personal bests of 37-1 and 34-4 respectively for fourth and fifth place.</p>
              <p align="left">Back on the track, the domination continued. Margaret Coad '15 earned second place in the 800 with a 2:24.49 and Marzen returned from the Mile to take third in 2:29.88. In the 1000, van den Heuvel took second in 3:05.09. Teammates, Burkland and Milly Helmick supported with fourth and fifth place finishes in 3:07.90 and 3:12.55.</p>
              <p align="left">In the next to last individual event, the 200, Jones and Simmons returned to the track to claim first and third in 26.39 and 27.21 respectively.</p>
              <p align="left">The 3000 saw a very impressive performance from freshman Dacie Manion as she never looked tired, dropping a 37 second final 200 to win in 10:19.89. McVay, coming back after the Mile, finished in third at 10:24.95 after leading for the majority of the race. Martina de Geus '14, lent a fourth place 10:33.06 to the scoring.</p>
              <p align="left">The men had an equally dominant team performance, but it did not start out that way. In the Mile Run, MIT's considerable talent did not translate into good performances, nor significant points. Justin Bullock '14, performed well, taking charge of the race early and taking the victory in 4:21.01. Rick Paez '15, also ran a strong race, never letting up, and taking third in 4:27.61. Pat Marx '13, making his debut in the Mile, did not engage in the race until it was too late. He did manage to move up to fourth in 4:27.90. Jay McKenna '14, added a sixth in 4:32.11.</p>
              <p align="left">Missing Josh Duncavage '13, due to too many absences to illness, took away significant talent and depth from the sprint and hurdle groups, but Tech managed to step up regardless. In the hurdles, Brian Djaja '13 slowed in the middle of the race, but regrouped to finish second in 8.20. John Thomas '15 ran a personal best of 7.61 to claim fourth. Jordan Mizerak '14 sharpened his Heptathlon skills with a fifth place. In the sprints, the 55 and 200 Meter Dashes, even Duncavage could not have taken down Colby sprinter, Dominique Kone, who won with excellent times of 6.41 and 22.46 respectively. Nevertheless, MIT held their own. Michael DuPlessis '14 had a great day by claiming second in the 55 with a personal best of 6.58 and then took third in the 200 in 23.51. Tyler Singer-Clark, complimented DuPlessis by taking fourth in the 55 in 6.78 and second in the 200 in 23.13.</p>
              <p align="left">In the oval events, Tech dominated by outscoring their opponents with 88 points plus winning both relays while Bates and Colby together earned 66 points. Mac Gager '14 took the 400 title with a 52.38 time on the tight turn track. Nick Diamantoni '15 provided a second place in 53.03 and Jake Jurewicz '14 added a third in 53.06 out of the slow section.</p>
              <p align="left">Chadd Kiggins '15 demonstrated what gave him a 1:53 800 last year in high school, as he took the 600 in an excellently paced race in 1:23.86. David Way '13 was close behind in third at 1:24.79. Dominique Hoskin '15 added a sixth in 1:30.07.</p>
              <p align="left">Bullock returned to the track in the 800, but was never really competitive despite his third place finish in 1:59.54. Jared Forman '13 gave his all, but could not hold onto the leaders, dropping off to fourth in 2:01.35. Paez, also doubling back from the mile, earned fifth in 2:01.68.</p>
              <p align="left">The 1000 results gave MIT 13 points, but not the victory. Bates, James LePage ran an outstanding 2:31.24 to run away from everyone. However, Gil O'Neil ran a solid early season time of 2:36.00 to take second place. Logan Trimble '13 made the effort to go with LePage, but paid dearly as he finished fourth after running a 69 final 400. Kyle Hannon '13, who continued his challenges with competitive situations, did pull out a fourth in 2:41.01 and McKenna returned from the Mile to add a sixth in 2:42.54.</p>
              <p align="left">Allen Leung '15 established an early pace in the 3000 of 71 second 400's through 1200 meters when the pace should have been 69's. When he slowed, the trio of Dan Harper '12, Roy Wedge '14 and Benji Xie '15 stayed behind, instead of moving up to continue or speed up the race. This casual pace set the quartet up for a vicious kick from Noah Graboys of Bates as he stole the race in the final 400. Harper earned second in 8:50.95, Xie third in 8:52.29, Leung  fourth in 8:52.50 and Wedge was fifth in 8:52.86.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 5K, Stephen Serene '12 led wire to wire to win in 15:37.05. His goal was to run sub 15:30 and was well on his way with a first mile in 4:53, but then added miles of 5:02 and 5:08 to fall too far behind pace to hit the New England Division III qualifying time. Kris Frey '15 supported Serene's victory with a fourth place 16:12.21 and Matt Weaver '12 returned to competition after dealing with an IT band injury, to take sixth in 16:44.32.</p>
              <p align="left">In the field events, the Weight Throw was probably the top event from a performance perspective. CK Umachi '12 took the victory with a fine toss of 60-8 3/4. Jeremy Sharpe '13 added a personal best of 49-7 1/4, good for third place. Freshman Cameron Wagar threw 41-7 to add a point for sixth place.</p>
              <p align="left">Sheldon Trotman '15 put together two victories, taking first place honors in both the Long Jump and the Triple Jump with marks of 20-4 1/2 and 41-7 1/4 as he learns to correct his approach. In both events Mizerak added points, earning fifth in the Triple Jump with a 39-6 and a sixth in the Long Jump.</p>
              <p align="left">In the vertical jumps, MIT took both events. Matt Falk '12 claimed first in the High Jump at 6-4. Trotman and Thomas tied for third at 6-0. Nathan Peterson '12 won the Pole Vault in 14-5 1/4 while Ben Schreck '15 took second at 13-11 1/4. Colin Hong '15 and Cory Monroe '13 tied for fourth in 12-5 1/2.</p>
              <p align="left">The Shot Put, the only field event the Engineers did not win, was still a solid effort for Tech. Umachi threw a personal best of 46-0 3/4 to take third and Sharpe threw 42-7 1/2, good for fifth place.</p>
              <p align="left">Next week, MIT will need an even better team performance when they visit Springfield College. There will be outstanding competition from Coast Guard, Keene State, Mount Holyoke, Ramapo, Smith, Tufts, UMass/Dartmouth, Westfield and Wheaton Colleges.</p>
