              <p style="font-size: 12px"><strong><span style="">MEN LOSE DUNCAVAGE, FAIL TO THREE-PETE</span></strong> <span style="font-weight: bold">IN NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP</span></p>
              <p align="left">February 18, 2012</p>
              <p align="left">The Men's Indoor Track and Field team represented MIT this weekend at the <a href="ned3men.res.php">New England Division III Championship</a>, hosted by Springfield College. The Engineers had won the previous two indoor championships and were hoping for a third. However, Bates College, winning their first ever New England Division III Track and Field title, proved to be too strong, while MIT had an injury to their top sprinter/hurdler and had some poor performances and an unfortunate handoff to make the comeback too much for the Engineers as they finished second among the 40+ teams with 95 points to 103 for Bates.</p>
              <p align="left">The men&#8217;s field events started off with the Weight Throw.  CK Umachi '12 entered the competition with the top seed and Jeremy Sharpe '13 was seeded 15th out of 19, and not expected to score. In order for Sharpe to make finals he would need to win his flight and beat two throwers from the second flight. On his third throw he delivered a big personal best of 51-10, clinching the flight win and a spot in finals where he finished eighth overall for one point. CK&acute;s dominance in the Weight Throw was challenged from the start from David Pless from Bates, throwing 2 cm farther and the top spot going into finals. On CK&acute;s first throw in finals he demonstrated his ability with a throw of 63-7.5 and a facility record. Pless from Bates then had a 3&acute; PR throwing 62-10, but was not able to match CK&acute;s throw, giving MIT 11 points.<br />
                <br />
                The next event was the High Jump. MIT had two jumpers competing, Matthew Falk '12 and John Thomas '15. &nbsp;Falk was not having a good  day, but Thomas was able to make the first three heights on his first attempt, clearing 6-2.25. The bar moved to 6-4.25 and only two of the remaining eleven jumpers cleared the height, giving Thomas an unexpected third place tie and five points.<br />
                <br />
                In the Pole Vault competition MIT entered three vaulters, Benjamin Schreck '15, Cory Monroe '13 and Nathan Peterson '12. Monroe had a gallant effort, vaulting 13-11.25 and season best on his first meet back after recovering from a severe ankle sprain, but placed 11th. Peterson made his first two vaults over 14-11 and 15-5 on his first attempts, clearing the bar easily. &nbsp;The bar moved to 15-11 and three jumpers remained. Peterson was unable to find his rhythm and finished second overall. <br />
                <br />
                The Triple Jump was represented by Jackson Wirekoh '13. In only his second meet of the indoor season, Wirekoh jumped 44-3.25 and a tie for eighth place going into finals. He was unable to improve in the finals, but won the tie for eighth place. His next best jump was better then the other jumper giving MIT one needed point.  </p>
              <p align="left">In the running events, Josh Duncavage '13 had a busy start to his day advancing to the finals of all three sprint races, running 8.65 for the 60m hurdles, 7.06 in the 60m and 22.70 in the 200m, although in the 200 he backed off significantly as he felt his hamstring tug a little, though he kept this news to himself.  Tyler Singer-Clark '14 gave Tech a 2nd runner in the 200 meter finals with a superb 22.64 trial.</p>
              <p align="left"> The first final race of the day was the mile. With the unseeded section won in 4:14 the fast section could not afford to hesitate.  Justin Bullock '13 got right to the front of the pack and made a strong move into the lead with 500m to go. Bowdoin soph Coby Horowitz passed Bullock with 120 meters to go, but Bullock hung on strong for second place and a PR of 4:14.39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left">Duncavage's first final of the day was the 60m hurdles, in which he placed 7th in 8.64. Not his best performance, but he is still working on his mechanics on top of the hurdle, particularly his trail leg.</p>
              <p align="left">Next up was the 400 meters and MIT was not seeded to score any points with Singer-Clark entering the meet as the 10th seed. He got out faster than he has all season and placed second in his section in 50.35 behind event winner Ben Scheetz of Amherst. Singer-Clark and his teammates anxiously watched the fast section to see how many would beat his time.  Fortunately only two of the six runners in the seeded section were able to beat his time to give him a fourth place finish.</p>
              <p align="left"> In the 600 MIT was only seeded to score a couple of points but  were confident they would move up several spots.  Mac Gager '13 placed second in his heat in a PR of 1:23.94 to earn eighth place overall. Junior Pat Marx dove across the line in the seeded heat to place second in a PR of 1:21.99.</p>
              <p align="left"> Tech was hoping for big points from Duncavage in the 60m finals but his hamstring did not hold. Early in the race it looked as though he might win, but with the injury he finished in sixth place  in 7.50. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left">In the 800 the Engineers sent out a couple of freshmen in Chadd Kiggins and Sam Parker. Both got out well in a tightly packed race. Both remained in  contention with 150 to go when Kiggins made a move to the lead. Only Bates junior James LePage was able to go with Kiggins and was able to out lean Kiggins by .09. Kiggins took second in 1:55.86. Parker hung on for eighth in 1:57.57.</p>
              <p align="left"> MIT was seeded to place well in the 1000 with five of the top 10 seeds in the event but when NCAA 800 meter champ and 4:03 miler Ben Scheetz of Amherst took the race out quickly none of our guys responded well. With several runners in the unseeded section running fast times the late race kicks of Bullock 2:32.63 and senior Stephen Serene 2:32.99 only moved them up to seventh and eithth place overall. For the second year in succession, the 1000 runners failed to take advantage of the opportunity, losing 20 points in seeds.</p>
              <p align="left"> MIT should have been looking to score big points in the 200 final but with a hamstring pull in his previous event Duncavage was only able to walk the finals to pick up what we hoped would be a valuable eighth place point. Singer-Clark continued his strong day by placing third in his heat and fourth overall in 22.73. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left">In the 3K frosh Benji Xie had a smart run in an odd race in which a Springfield runner ran 30 seconds for the 1st 200m &amp; held a big lead early. Xie went through the 1600 in an even paced 4:35 and was in position to contend for a top 3 place with 600 to go. However he just did not have another gear, finishing 12th in 8:44.00 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left">The Engineers knew that they needed big points in the 5k.  Dan Harper '12,  Allen Leung '15, and Roy Wedge '13 certainly gave it their best effort. All three ran as a pack and were in the top five with 1200 to go. Harper pulled away from the rest of the field and gained on the early leader to place second in 15:01.62. Leung hung on for 10th in 15:11 but Wedge's legs gave out over the last couple of laps to place 15th in 15:27 after being in top three contention for most of the race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left">In the Distance Medley Relay, Logan Trimble '13 stayed close to the leaders with his 3:09 leg, putting MIT in fifth place.  David Way '13 moved  up a bit with his 52.5 leg and Serene ran a strong 1:59 leg to move Tech up to the lead.  Ben Mattocks '12 gave his team a shot at the win until the very end with his strong 4:23 leg but he was being chased by the first and third place finishers in the mile and was unable to hold them off, taking third place in a solid 10:24.37.</p>
              <p align="left">The 4x400 team came in seeded second but they were not about to get beat in a race this important to the team standings. Singer-Clark continued his strong day by taking a solid lead with his 50.1 leg. Gager followed with a 51.0 and  Nick Diamantoni '15 ran a 51.9 leg to give anchor Pat Marx a lead to work with. Runners from Williams and Tufts attempted to move up on Marx but he kicked away coming off the final turn for a 50.6 leg and a 3:24.89 relay win. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left">Tech went into the 4x800 relay trailing Bates by 3 points, knowing they had a team that could get the job done but some unfortunate circumstances spoiled the big duel. After Kiggins 1:58 leg it was just MIT and Westfield State in the lead but after running into the Westfield runner who had just handed off,  Jared Forman '13 fell and dropped the baton. He jumped up pretty quickly but by then MIT was in last place with a lot of ground to make up. Forman ended up with a 2:05 leg. Parker got out strong, running splits of 27 and 56, but faded to 1:58. Gil O'Neil fed off  the MIT chants, moving up to as high as third place  with 70 meters to go before ending up sixth in their section and eighth overall in 8:02.01. Bates finished third to ice the victory.</p>
