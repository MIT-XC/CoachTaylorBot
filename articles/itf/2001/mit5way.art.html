POINTS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>January 27, 2001</P>

<P>The MIT Engineers and Williams College Ephmen once again did
battle on the track and the field to see who the best Division III
men's team was in New England. The two schools have won all but 5 of
the New England Division III Indoor Championships since the inception
of the league in 1980. This battle was won by Williams by the close
score of 204.5 to 201. RPI was third with 118, Westfield State was
fourth with 43.5, and Colby fifth with 36.</P>

<P>Once the coaches had submitted their entries, Williams was the
clear favorite with a 33 point edge. The MIT team they would have to
make up those points in the 55HH and Long Jump where they had not
performed very well this season. In addition, the 400-1000 meter
events where Williams was so deep, would have to be countered if
success was to come to the Engineers.</P>

<P>MIT took the lead in the first event and did not relinquish that
lead for 13 events. Williams finally took the lead with an excellent
showing in the 200. MIT, without their top 200 runner who missed the
meet for academic reasons, only scored 1 point in the event when
Yuval Mazor came back from his second place finish in the 400 to run
a fine 23.72 season best. However, Williams scored 13 points to take
a 160.5 to 154 lead.</P>

<P>MIT came right back to deliver a solid thrashing in the 3000, led
by Dan Feldman's 8:45.48 first place finish. Dan's run was
particularly impressive since he had run a 4:04.56 1500 a little over
an hour earlier. Tech's 21 points outscored Williams 12 points and
retook the lead 177 to 172.5.</P>

<P>Tech Coach Halston Taylor, figuring his team had to win both
relays to win the meet, balanced them by moving 1600 relay anchor man
Sean Montgomery to the anchor leg of the DMR. Williams took the 1600
Relay with an excellent 50 flat anchor to lead their team to a
3:26.80 to 3:28.79 victory and spoil MIT's hopes of sweeping the
relays. The 9 to 7 point victory brought the Ephs to within 2.5
points. The DMR, led by freshman Brian Anderson's 3:09 leadoff 1200
(after his 4:05 1500 and 2:00 800 in the non-relay events), and Mark
Jeunnette's 2:00 800 leg to make up for his fall in the 600 when he
tried to pass on the inside, pulled out a 10:36.81 to 10:39.01
victory to extend the lead back to 4.5 points.</P>

<P>The meet would once again come down to the final event. This time
it was the triple jump that was extending the length of the meet.
With both teams crowding the infield, inspiring their jumpers to do
their best, Williams was able to secure 2nd and 3rd places with NCAA
provisionally qualifying performances of 46-2 and 46-1. They also
placed 6th, which was more than enough to defeat MIT, who were only
able to place 4th and 5th in the event. The 16 points Williams
garnered compared to MIT's 9, gave the men from Williamstown the
204.5 to 201 hard fought victory.</P>

<P>Highlights for the Engineers were many. Sean Montgomery won both
his events with easy victories in the 1500 (4:03.12) and 1000
(2:34.71). Brian Hoying has quickly become a multi event threat by
tieing for first place in the High Jump (6-4), placing third in the
Long Jump (21-1 1/4), and third in the 400 with a 51.72 performance.
Brian also ran a 51 leg in the 1600 Relay. Rick Rajter won the 55HH
with another 7.87 time, placed 7th in his first ever 55 dash, running
6.87, placed 3rd in the High Jump with a PR of 6-4, and jumped to a
5th place in the Triple Jump. Other victories by MIT were earned by
Brian Wong in the 35lb. Weight Throw (51-01), Craig Mielcarz in the
High Jump (6-4), and Dan Opila with a PR of 14-0 in the Pole
Vault.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT takes their 5-1 record on the road to Tufts to do
battle with 7 other schools. The meet should be a close meet between
MIT, College of New Jersey, Tufts, and Springfield College. Others in
the meet are Amherst College, Ithaca and Wesleyan.</P>
