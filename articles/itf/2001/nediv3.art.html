Battle</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>February 17, 2001</P>

<P>MIT, seeded 46 points behind Williams going into the New England
Division III Indoor Track and Field Championships, lost by 10 points
to the powerful Ephmen, 121-111. Fifteen personal bests, 5 victories,
3 NCAA qualifying performances, one varsity record, one freshman
record and one meet record summarizes the damage done by the
Engineers.</P>

<P>As they are accustomed to doing, MIT led the meet off with a
superb showing in the Pentathlon. Craig Mielcarz not only won the
event for the 2nd consecutive year, he set the record by 125 points
and qualified automatically in the High Jump for the NCAA
Championship. Nursing a bad hamstring caused by a near collision in
practice, Rick Rajter was unable to perform at the highest level.
Nevertheless, he managed a personal record of 3380 points while
securing 3rd place. The surprise of the event was turned in by Tony
Pelosi. Tony, who was seeded 5th, scored over 180 points than ever
before, setting personal bests in three of the five events and
placing 4th to give MIT 20 points in the first event. Freshman,
Adrian Townsend did not score, but he did finish only one place out
of scoring and improved his total by nearly 400 points. Williams
scored 8 points with a gutsy 2nd place finish.</P>

<P>On Saturday, Tech went to work on trying to take one event at a
time but focusing on making up the points they were not seeded to
get. In the Weight Throw, Brian Wong made a huge personal best throw
of 52-04 1/2 in the first flight to lead the event briefly. The
second flight had two throwers pass that mark, and one more passed
him in the finals. Brian's mark qualified him provisionally for the
NCAA Championships.</P>

<P>Brian Hoying was not able to quite get on the board with his best
jump in the long jump. He was only able to leap 20-10, missing
placing by 2 centimeters. However, what Brian could not accomplish in
the LJ, he made up for in the High Jump by winning the event and
automatically qualifying for nationals with a jump of 6-9 3/4.
Brian's jump broke the varsity record held by Tom Washington '92, and
teammate Craig Mielcarz. Not able to get his mind or legs into the
game after winning the pentathlon the day before, Mielcarz was only
able to garner 5th in the HJ with a leap of 6-3 1/4.</P>

<P>The Tech vaulters did not vault very high, but they did their job
by scoring 12 points with 3rd, 4th, and 5th places. Sam Thibault
could not find his 14-6 form from a week ago, but would have needed
14-8 to improve his place. Dan Kwon jumped to a PR with his 13-8 1/4
mark for 4th place.</P>

<P>Kalpak Kothari, expecting to score in the Triple Jump, seemed flat
the entire competition. His best jump of the day was not even enough
to make the finals in an event which Williams was able to win. </P>

<P>On the track, MIT was entered in every event except the 200
meters, that is until they had to scratch both Junius Ho and Rick
Rajter from the 55 High Hurdles due to hamstring problems. Tech's
attitude could not be altered as they continued to set personal bests
in spite of the odds.</P>

<P>Freshman Andrew Francis started his peak at the right time with a
.13 PR of 6.52 in the 55 dash to set a freshman record and get 2nd
place. Also in the event was Marc Washington. Marc has been running
6.70 for the last month but can't seem to run any faster. Once again
he produced a 6.70, missing finals by .01 second.</P>

<P>Yuval Mazor went out a bit too fast in the 400 trials and missed
the finals by .04 seconds even though he ran a personal best of
51.34. Mark Jeunnette made up for Yuval's error by placing third in
the 600 with a fine 1:23.72. Matt Lehman, also in the 600, had a
great opportunity in the trials but got himself stuck on the rail,
getting boxed in and unable to move on the final straight.</P>

<P>Brian Anderson continued the success story for the MIT freshmen
with a strong performance in the 800. A bit anxious, Brian went out
in 26 seconds for the first 200 when he had planned a 28. This early
pace was probably enough to keep him from winning the event as he was
unable to respond when passed in the final 300 meters, finishing 4th,
but only 1.3 seconds out of 1st.</P>

<P>Sean Montgomery continued to struggle after a late season bout
with the flu, dying in the final 500 meters of the 1500 and barely
holding on for 6th place with a 4:01. However, he seemed to remember
what it was like to run fast in the 1000. Sean was passed in the
final 400 meters, gave up for a few seconds and then responded to
place 3rd with a 2:32.51. John Biesiadecki ran 2:33. 81 for a big PR
and 5th place. Biesiadecki had convinced Coach Halston Taylor to
enter him in the 1000, saying he would score and be able to come back
in the 3200 relay. Coach Taylor had been reluctant to do so because
Biesiadecki's time had only been 2:35 going into the meet and winning
the 3200 relay seemed more realistic.</P>

<P>In the 3000, Dan Feldman never considered anything but winning.
Dan had a 10 meter lead after 400 meters and only expanded it as he
went, winning by nearly 5 seconds in 8:32.97. Sean Nolan placed 5th
in the 5000 with a PR of 15:09.82. Ed Keehr and Albert Liu also made
the 5000 field but were unable to score.</P>

<P>Going into the 5000 and Triple Jump, the final events before the
relays, MIT was ahead of Williams by 8 points. However the Ephmen
were able to score 12 in the Triple and 6 in the 5K. MIT hoped to
score 20 points in the relays but so did Williams. All MIT could do
was hope for a miracle.</P>

<P>The DMR was first. MIT was hoping to put some points on the board
but did not load up this event, preferring the 1600 and 3200 relays.
The strategy seemed sound as Tech was able to actually give the baton
to anchor Liyan Guo in the lead. Matt Yarosz had run a 3:14 1200,
followed by a solid 51 by Todd Rosenfield. Phil Loiselle was the one
who put Tech in the lead with a 2:00 800 leg. Liyan was a bit nervous
and went out in 29 seconds for the first 200 of the 1600. This pretty
much cooked the goose was Tech as Liyan struggle home in 4th place
with a 4:38, 10 seconds out of first, which was won by Williams. This
gave Williams a 16 point lead.</P>

<P>In the 1600 Relay, MIT never saw an opposing runner after Brian
Hoying took the break on the opening leg. Brian brought the baton
home in 50.3, a very sound opening 400. Matt Lehman followed with a
50.4 leg to expand the lead. Yuval Mazor made up for his open 400
with a 50.3 leg. Finally, Sean Montgomery was able to coax his tired
legs to the finish in 51.4 to give MIT it's 3rd consecutive 4x400 New
England Division III title with a 3:22.64 time. Unfortunately,
Williams was able to place 2nd to secure the Championship.</P>

<P>The final event, the 3200 relay was one the Engineers had hoped to
win. John Biesiadecki led off and while he did not bring the baton
home in first, he did run well enough with a 2:02 to keep his team in
the race. Mark Jeunnette shook off the fatigue from his two 600s and
blasted a 1:57.6 to secure a solid lead for MIT. George Hanson, the
only fresh Tech runner, ran a personal best of 1:59.9 leg to all but
secure the victory. The victory was secure because Brian Anderson was
not about to let anyone walk him down. Brian matched his open time
with a fine 1:55 split, bringing the baton in 1st with a 9 second
victory in 7:55.55.</P>

<P>Next weekend, MIT will compete in the All Division New England
Championship hosted by BU. </P>
