CHAMPIONSHIP</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>January 13, 2001</P>

<P>After a three and a half week break, the Engineers came back to
Cambridge in better shape than expected as they qualified seven more
individuals for the New England Division III Championships on
February 16 and 17. The Beaver Relays, an annual competition hosted
by MIT, is a non-scoring invitational with a full schedule of events
including a pentathlon, shuttle hurdle relay and the field events
competed in relay fashion where the top three competitors from a team
combine their distances or heights to produce a team total. In
addition to MIT, other teams were Fitchburg State College, the
University of Southern Maine and the United States Coast Guard
Academy.</P>

<P>To start things off , the pentathlon was dominated by MIT
athletes. Rick Rajter '03, and Craig Mielcarz '03, the defending New
England Div. III champion and runner-up, in reverse order, combined
once again to go 1-2 in this meet. Rick, finishing first this time,
scored 3299 to easily make the 2900 point qualifying mark for this
year's championship. Craig was close behind with 3244 points and Tony
Pelosi '01, also qualified with 2941 points.</P>

<P>In the Weight Throw, Brian Wong 'G, improved his qualifying mark
with a 49-3 3/4 personal best to finish second. Also with a personal
best in the event was David Saylor '04, with a throw of 36-9. </P>

<P>The pole vaulters had a good day. Sam Thibault 'G, finished second
with a jump of 13-6. Dan Opila '03, improved his season best with a
vault of 13-6 as well. Opila's vault joined Thibault and Dan Kwon as
New England Division III qualifiers.</P>

<P>Mark Washington '03, ran 6.70 to finish second in the 55 meter
dash and qualify for the<FONT SIZE="+2"><B> </B></FONT>NE Div. III
Championships. Freshman Andrew Francis ran a personal best of 6.71 to
miss qualifying by .01 seconds. Mark and Andrew also ran personal
bests in the 200 with 23.45 and 23.86 respectively, but the
performances were short of the 22.94 necessary to qualify for the
championship. </P>

<P>Yuval Mazor '02, was back from an early season injury to win the
400 with a 52.31. Another winner was Brian Hoying '03, in the High
Jump. Brian jumped 6-6 for the second time this year. Sean Montgomery
won the Mile run, but his time of 4:30.20 was less than
spectacular.</P>

<P>The Engineers dominated the distance events, winning both the 3000
and 5000 meter runs. In the 3000, Dan Feldman '02, ran a championship
qualifying time of 8:44.80 despite a head cold. Liyan Guo, '01, led a
1-2-3 sweep in the 5000 with a 15:47.72 performance. Albert Liu '03,
and Ed Keehr '01, finished with times of 15:58.30 and 16:04.79
respectively.</P>

<P>Freshman Brian Anderson had a spectacular day, winning the 800
with a qualifying time of 1:57.76, and then coming back to lead the
3200 Relay team to victory with a 1:58 effort. The quartet of
Anderson, Montomery, George Hanson '03, and John Biesiadecki '01, ran
a 8:07.77, which will surely get the unit into the fast section of
the Division III Championship.</P>

<P>In all, Tech won every running event above the 200 meters,
including all relays and the pentathlon. The field events were not
quite as successful with only 1 victory out of six events. However,
much of the strength in the field events was held out of individual
competition since they had competed in the pentathlon earlier.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT travels to Bates to face the Bobcats as well as the
Coast Guard Academy in a scoring meet.</P>
