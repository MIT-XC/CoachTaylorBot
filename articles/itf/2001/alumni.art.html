83-39</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">December 16, 2000</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Twenty MIT track and field alumni came through the
door to the Johnson Athletic Center on Saturday to compete against
the young Varsity squad in the annual Alumni-Varsity track meet.
Twenty experienced, but slightly older bodies, were no match for a
greater number of somewhat younger and fresher undergraduates. The
Varsity won all but three events en route to a 83-39
victory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The scoring was set at the traditional, but no
longer used by the NCAA, 5 points for 1st, 3 for 2nd, and 1 for 3rd.
Generally, the Alumni have been able to win the meet or keep it close
by gaining first place thus winning the event. Bill Singhose '90,
Ravi Sastry '99 and company were not enough this year. Just two years
ago, Singhose scored 30 points in winning 6 events, and his
supporting cast did the rest. This year, the combination of Marc
Washington, winner in the 55 and 200, Sean Montgomery, winner in the
1500 and 800 and Rick Rajter, winner in the Triple Jump and 55HH led
the Varsity to an unprecedented sweep of first places in all the
running events.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">On the high end of performances for the Varsity,
Craig Mielcarz made good his one event by clearing 6-8 in the High
Jump. He had a couple of near misses at 6-9, but still made the
provisional qualifying mark for Nationals. Qualifying for the New
England Division III Championships were Mielcarz and Brian Hoying in
the High Jump, Rick Rajter in the 55HH and Triple Jump, Kalpak
Kothari, also in the Triple Jump, Sam Thibault and Dan Kwon in the
Pole Vault, Brian Wong in the Weight Throw and Dan Feldman in the
5000 meters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">There is no question the MIT varsity is far
removed from Championship form. However, they appear to be will ahead
of last year's pace, which netted them the New England Division III
title. As good as they appear for this time of year, eight
championship scorers, and two key freshmen missed the competition due
to injury, illness and other reasons. All of these athletes hope to
be competing in January, which will definitely make the Engineers a
team to be respected, if not feared.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">MIT's team is in exams next week. They are not
back for practice until January 8th when they prepare for the Beaver
Relays on 1/13.</FONT></P>
