            <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 16px">Team Has Mixed Results as Some Events Perform Well While Others Do Not</span></p>
            <p align="left">February 6, 2016</p>
            <p align="left">The potential problem with having such an amazing weekend of performances as MIT did last weekend, and having the New England Division III Championship three weeks later, is that the two weekends in between could set the teams up for a let down if they are not properly prepared mentally and physically.&nbsp; That problem came to fruition for MIT as some event&nbsp;areas in the <a href="cupid.res.php">Tufts University Cupid Challenge</a> performed average at best, while others were focused and locked in for the most part.</p>
            <p align="left">The meet was non-scoring, which added to taking the pressure off to perform well.&nbsp;Nevertheless, some event&nbsp;groups were fired up for the opportunity to compete against top competition.&nbsp; In addition to host Tufts, competing teams included Williams College, Amherst College, Conn. College, Bridgewater State College, Middlebury College, SUNY Geneseo, Brandeis University and Wellesley College.</p>
            <p align="left">The best performing event area was the 5K.&nbsp; The women were up first, sans Maryann Gong '17.&nbsp; The pace was pretty brisk with 83-84 second 400's.&nbsp; Nicole Zeinstra '16, Mary Eccles '18 and Bailee Margolis '19 were in the lead group representing MIT.&nbsp; In fact, Margolis, not too wisely, initially led the field and set the pace.&nbsp; The lead group stayed intact through 2000 meters, as they hit the 1600 in 5:33.&nbsp; As the leaders continued at that pace for a while longer, Margolis pulled her parachute after 2400 meters, going from 84 to 90 second quarters.&nbsp; Zeinstra and Eccles also fell off the leaders, but continued to fight as they came through 3200 in 11:14 while Margolis was at 11:25.&nbsp;The final 1600 was a 5:50 for both Zeinstra&nbsp;and Eccles as they crossed the 4800 line in 17:05.&nbsp; Zeinstra had a lot more left than she thought, running a 39 final 200 for a 17:44.87 fifth place finish.&nbsp; Eccles finished in 17:49.17 for a new personal best.&nbsp; Ciera Gordon '18 ran a personal best of 18:47.27.&nbsp; Others running personal bests for Tech were Darby LaPlant&nbsp;'19 running 18:51.28 and Camila Thanos '19 running 18:53.62.&nbsp; All, including Margolis qualified for the New England Division III Championship</p>
            <p align="left">The men also launched into a very quick pace as the leader took the pace out in 67 seconds&nbsp;for the opening 400.&nbsp; The Engineers were looking for 70's initially and hoped to race from there.&nbsp; Dennis Maloney '19, Josh Rosenkranz '19, Rory Beyer '17, Daniel Weiss '19, Matt Deyo '16 and Brian Gilligan '17 were all in the ballpark, coming through the 1600 anywhere from 4:39 to 4:42.&nbsp; Gilligan fell off shortly after and Deyo was playing it a little safe as he has only been running a little for two weeks since coming back from a foot fracture keeping him out for two months.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maloney and Beyer came through 3200 meters in 9:25.&nbsp; Rosenkranz was back at 9:27.&nbsp; Deyo was four seconds back at 9:31 and Weiss at 9:34.&nbsp; The group slowed at this point to 74-75 pace, allowing Deyo to get back in it.&nbsp; At 4800 Maloney was still leading the MIT contingent at 14:23 with Deyo and Rosenkranz just behind at 14:24.&nbsp; Deyo dropped a 32 to run 14:56.46, just nipping Rosenkranz at 14:56.63.&nbsp; Maloney was just behind at 14:57.05.</p>
            <p align="left">While Maryann Gong took advantage of a rabbit situation in the Mile, the men wasted a&nbsp;great opportunity.&nbsp; Louise van den Heuvel '14 agreed to set a pace of 3:00 through 1000 meters to lead Gong to a fast time.&nbsp; The pace was just off at 3:01, but certainly close enough.&nbsp; Gong closed out with a 74 final 400 to run a 4:52.57, the fastest time in the country for DIII, particularly on a flat 200 meter track.&nbsp; This is the third week in a row that Gong has run the fastest time in the country in her respective event; 3000 on 1/23, 5000 on 1/29 and the Mile today.&nbsp; On the men's side of things, the rabbit was set to take the pace out in 3:06-3:07 for 1200 meters.&nbsp; Colin Godwin '17 was unable to run due to a&nbsp;potential injury.&nbsp;That left Aidan Gilson '19 to take advantage&nbsp;of the opportunity.&nbsp; After a slow, but negative split 63 first 400 with the pace picking up, Gilson panicked and backed off.&nbsp; While he ran a respectable 4:17 he did not compete and missed an excellent chance to qualify for Nationals.&nbsp; David Walter '18 ran a personal best of 4:24.39 and has a lot more potential in the tank.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 800, Bailey Tregoning '19 was hoping for a competitive race, but no&nbsp;one seemed to want to run fast&nbsp;after an initial 200 in 33 seconds.&nbsp; The pace slowed to a 72 middle 400 until Tregoning kicked a final 200 in 33 to win going away in 2:18.72.&nbsp; Jarod Wilson '19, fresh off his 1:52.74 last weekend, had Mitchell Black of Tufts, the defending national&nbsp;champion rabbiting the 800 for his teammate, but just like Gilson, after a 26 first 200 he panicked and gave up, finishing in 2:00.25.&nbsp; Nathan Munet '19, in another section, ran a personal indoor best 1:58.73.</p>
            <p align="left">As usual, the men totally dominated the long sprints.&nbsp; In the 200, largely a lane dependent race, Tre Albritten '18 won in 22.38.&nbsp; Michael Kaba '16, running out of lane three, was second in 22.74, Danny Newman third in 22.75 and States Lee '16 fourth in 22.98.&nbsp; Earlier in the 400, Lee won in 49.84, Newman was second in 50.13 and Derek Barnes was third in 50.32.&nbsp; Tom&nbsp;Frejowski '19 has come around nicely, running 52.76 to place seventh.</p>
            <p align="left">Kunal Tangri '19 ran a&nbsp;nice 1000, running even 30 second laps&nbsp;to a 2:30.81 third place finish.&nbsp; Later he, Munet, Gilson and Wilson ran an all freshman 4x800 relay, winning in 7:52.42.&nbsp; Munet led off with a 1:58.4, Tangri was second in 1:58.7, followed by Gilson at 1:58.5.&nbsp; Wilson first expanded, then lost a 10 meter lead before closing hard to run 1:56.6 for the victory.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 4x400, MIT put together mostly B team runners, who ran extraordinarily well to win in 3:27.64.&nbsp; Luca Cacopardo '18 led off in a poor and non-competitive 53.8, but then Barnes, Henry Tareque '17 and Frejowski all ran 51.2 splits to get the job done.&nbsp; The women also ran a 4x400 Relay and just missed the victory.&nbsp; Hannah Chen '18 ran an excellent 59.1 lead-off leg to give Tech the lead.&nbsp; Gong, coming back from a 3:01.22 1000 after her Mile Run victory, was only able to run a 64.3 split, but maintained the lead.&nbsp; Natalie Alper '17 ran a very strong 60.9 to give Tregoning&nbsp;the lead.&nbsp; Although she opened with a 28.7 first lap, Tregoning was losing the lead little by little to a strong Tufts University anchor leg.&nbsp; Stumbling in the final 50, Tregoning gave up the lead despite a 60.9 anchor for a 4:05.50 performance.</p>
            <p align="left">In the field events the throwers led the way with best performances.&nbsp; Jackie Vahey '17 won the Weight Throw with a new personal best of 52-8 3/4 and Audrey Pillsbury '19 threw nearly a meter further than before with her 35-2 in the Shot Put.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alper once again tied her PR of 5-3 3/4 to win the High Jump and Isabella Stuopis '16 won the Shot Put with a throw of 40-9.&nbsp;Cimmy Virdi '16 did not compete at this meet as she competed the night before at the <a href="Harvard Crimson Elite.res.webarchive">Crimson Elite meet at Harvard</a> where she won the Pole Vault in a new indoor personal best of 13-3 1/2, the leading vault in the country for Division III.&nbsp; Virdi was the only athlete at the meet representing MIT.</p>
            <p align="left">For the men&nbsp;Alex Noakes '16 threw a best of 46-5 1/2 in the Weight Throw for fourth place and Jon Fakkema '19 threw a personal best of 44-11 1/2 for third place in the Shot Put.&nbsp;Arinze Okeke '17 won the Long Jump with&nbsp;a leap of 22-0 3/4 and Billy Ruschel '18 won the Trip Jump with a jump of 46-3 1/2.</p>
            <p align="left">Next week MIT will again split their squad, sending many oval runners to BU for the David Hemery Valentines Invitational while keeping the field event personnel and short sprinters&nbsp;at MIT.&nbsp; The Engineers will also rest many of their qualified athletes as they head into the championships the following weekend.&nbsp; Both teams know they are capable of better overall performances, and will need the entire team to deliver if they hope to defend their New England Division III titles.</p>
