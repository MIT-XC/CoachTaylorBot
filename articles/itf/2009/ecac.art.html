              <p><strong><span class="style5">Women and Men Continue to Set NCAA Qualifying Marks</span></strong></p>
              <p> March 6-7, 2009 </p>
              <p align="left">MIT's Women's and Men's Indoor Track and Field teams continued their record setting ways. The women led the way with two new varsity records and four new or improved NCAA Division III qualifying performances. The men added one new PR and improved NCAA qualifying mark. </p>
              <p align="left">Although this is a scored championship, MIT only sends those who have a chance of qualifying for nationals, preferring to have the others begin to work on their outdoor track skills since it is such a short season. </p>
              <p align="left">On day one of the <a href="ecac.res.html">ECAC Division III Championship</a>, hosted by Tufts University, Amy Magnuson '10 and Portia Jones '12, got things started with the 55HH trials. Jones led off, winning her heat with a 8.47 and then Magnuson hurdled her way to a season best 8.30 to win her heat.</p>
              <p align="left">The men's triple jump was going on at the same time, which Stephen Morton '10, was hoping to win and improve his season best mark and third best jump in the country for Division III. However, he was not consistent in his approach and was only able to manage a 46' effort for fourth place.</p>
              <p align="left">Emily Hwang '09 and Karin Fisher '12 were both in the pole vault. Fisher jumped an indoor personal best of 11-1 3/4 to finish ninth while Hwang cleared 12-1 1/2 to finish third and remain the fourth ranked vaulter for nationals. The men's vault followed and MIT's Greg Tao '10, was one of four individuals to clear 15-11. At 16-5, Tao looked the best, but none of the vaulters cleared. Tao finished fourth on misses and is now tied for 10th in the country for Division III. Cyrus Vafadari '12, started well, clearing 13-5 1/4 but then was unable to clear the next height.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 5000, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, was going for a national qualifying time. Her best going into the meet was 17:50. Planning on holding 5:33 mile pace, the opening mile was near perfect at 5:32. Mile two was 11:08, so she was still on pace. Taking the lead just as it began to slow she put together two 83 second quarters. However, at that point she faltered running a 88 and then a 91, losing the lead. She regained focus, finishing with a 86 and then a 38 second final 200 to finish second in 17:34.39. That time currently has her ranked 18th in the country, but will not likely be good enough to get into the NCAA Championships as they only tend to take around 11 athletes per event.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event of the night was the women distance medley relay. The women were seeded 13th nationally with a banked track time of 12:03, which converts to a 12:06 for flat tracks according to the NCAA, and needed to move up significantly in the rankings to gain selection. Jennifer Doyle '09, a distance runner, led off with the 1200. Doing her best to keep up with the leaders, Doyle went out a bit too fast, coming through the first 400 in 69 and the 800 in 2:23. The final 400 was extremely painful but she held on to some degree to finish in 3:47. Jones took the baton and moved up quickly, although she too went out too fast with a 26.9 first 200, trying to make up the ground. Finishing in 58.3, Jones handed off to Andrea Bradshaw '09, for the 800 leg. Bradshaw also went out too fast, running the first 200 in 31 and the 400 in 65, but again, trying to make up the ground made it difficult to hold back. Nevertheless, Bradshaw was able to finish in 2:15.8 to get MIT close to the front. Jacqui Wentz anchored the relay and did an outstanding job getting the team to third place with a 12:01.56 with her anchor 4:59.9 1600, leading MIT to a new record. Due to other teams moving up in the country, MIT is still ranked 13th, probably just outside those that will gain selection.</p>
              <p align="left">On Saturday, again the 55HH led things off. Any Magnuson, placed second with yet another season best with a time of 8.24 to reach the auto standard for qualifying for the NCAA Championship, currently holding onto fifth position. Jones did not fair so well, finishing sixth in 8.62.</p>
              <p align="left">In the long jump, Morton did not jump quite as well as he was accustomed to, but did jump 22-8 1/2 for second place. Morton has at least one minor foul at 23-6 or so. He is seeded third in the triple jump and fourth in the long jump for next week's NCAA Championship. </p>
              <p align="left">The final event of the meet was the 4x400 relay. MIT had not been close to qualifying thus far in the season but there was belief on the team that they could run the mark needed. The problem was that MIT was placed in the third fastest section due to their 4:02 previous best time. Nevertheless, the quartet of Jones, Bradshaw, Martha Gross '12 and Hazel Briner '11 were ready to go. Jones led off with an excellent 58.2 leg taking the lead on the backstretch of the final lap. Bradshaw ran a perfect 400, nearly even splitting a 59.6 leg for her best 400 ever. Gross also ran an excellent 400, although she may have run the first 200 a little fast, going out in 27.8. Her final split of 59.6 put MIT in a great position. Briner, whose best previous 400 was a 61.9, ran an excellent leg, splitting a 61.0 to give MIT a 3:58.40, putting the team 11th on the national list at that time and setting a new MIT record.</p>
              <p align="left">Over on the other side of Boston, at Boston University, the IC4A Championship was being held. Yermie Cohen '09 and Matt Bieniosek '09, were competing for MIT in the mile and 800 respectively. The IC4A is primarily a Division I conference including states from North Carolina up to Maine and west to Indiana. Cohen was in a heat where they were content to go out slow, coming through the 800 in 2:07 and the 1200 in 3:11. Cohen was not able to go with the leaders on the final 400 but did finish in 62 to run 4:13.53. Bieniosek was in a great heat but was just not able to mix it up with the leaders in the final 400 as he finished with a 1:54.79. Cohen is currently seeded 11th for next weekend's NCAA Championship. </p>
              <p align="left">The only thing left for the Engineer's to do is wait to see who gets in on Monday morning. Those provisionally qualified but not mentioned are Jones, seeded third in the 400, Wentz seeded second in the 5000 and Doyle seeded 23rd in the 5000. The NCAA Division III Championship will be on Friday and Saturday, March 13-14 at Rose Hulman Institute in Terre Haute, Indiana.</p>
