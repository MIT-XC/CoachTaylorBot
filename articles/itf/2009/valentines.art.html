              <p> February 13-14, 2009 </p>
              <p align="left">The Lady Engineers had their best meet to date as they shattered six MIT varsity records at the <a href="valentines.res.html">Valentines Invitational</a> hosted by Boston University. Portia Jones '12, led the way with two of these records, running 59.02 in the 400 and 25.98 in the 200 to break her own freshman and varsity records. The most impressive single performance was run by Jacqui Wentz '10, who ran 5:00.33 in the mile to provisionally qualify for nationals and break the MIT record by over nine seconds.</p>
              <p align="left">Andrea Bradshaw '09, broke her own 800 record with a national provisional qualifying time of 2:15.83. Jennifer Doyle '09, broke the 3000 varsity record with an impressive 10:11.98, running all of her 400 splits between 82-84 seconds.</p>
              <p align="left">Even though they did not set any records, many MIT women ran outstanding races and season and personal bests. Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, ran over a 14 second PR in the mile, and breaking the old varsity record with a 5:08.53 winning effort. Also in the distance events, Tania Morimoto '12, ran a 10 second personal best of 10:34.46. </p>
              <p align="left">Kirsten Aarsvold '11, ran a two second personal best in the 500 with a 1:22.12 section victory. Amy Magnuson '10, continued her comeback from last springs hamstring tear with a national qualifying 8.40 in the 55HH.</p>
              <p align="left">Martha Gross ran an indoor personal best in the 400 with a 60.83. In the 200 Margaret Leibovic '10, ran a season best of 27.18. In the final event of the first day, the 1000 meters, Adrienne Bolger '09, returned to normal form with a 3:01.18 performance and Katherine Eve '12, ran a PR of 3:03.45.</p>
              <p align="left">To start day two, the women picked up where they left off, qualifying for nationals in the distance medley relay with yet another MIT record, running 12:03.55. Doyle led off in the 1200 leg with a 3:43.9. Jones did not get out well, but after the first 50 meters she was unbelievable, running 57.7 for the 400. Bradshaw took the baton in second place, made up the twenty meter difference just after the first 400, which she split in 67, but then slowed even as she continued to pull away, finishing in 2:19.1. Wentz anchored, pulled away even more, but with no one to race found it difficult to run as fast as she is capable, finishing in 5:02.8.</p>
              <p align="left">The men ran the distance medley relay the first day, hoping to just run fast enough to get a time that would guarantee the fast section at next week's New England Division III Championship. Richard Prevost '11, started everything off with a very well run 3:08 1200. Kahlil Dozier '12, ran his first of four races for the weekend and ran a personal best relays split of 52.3. Stephen Serene '12, went out a little fast and died coming into the final lap, posting a 2:03 leg. Paul Welle '11, ran a great anchor mile in 4:20 to give the Engineers a 10:24.70, accomplashing their goal.</p>
              <p align="left">On day two, the milers got things going and Yermie Cohen '09, led the way with a personal best 4:13.34. Welle came back for the open mile, running 4:22.53. Hemu Arumugam '10, also ran the mile, posting a 4:23.40.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 400, both MIT runners ran big personal bests. Nick Leonard '11, was up first, and toured the track twice in 50.13. Dozier continued his improvements with a 51.63 performance. Not long afterwards, Dozier returned to the track in the 200 and ran yet another personal best, this time a 22.70. Stephen Morton '10, ran a season best 22.43 despite being sick.</p>
              <p align="left">Continuing to return to his winning ways with his comeback from his injury during cross country season, Kevin Kleinguetl '11, ran 1:08.28 in the 500. </p>
              <p align="left">In the 800, Matt Bieniosek '09, continued to run well despite the distance. After splitting 57.0 at the 400, he brought it home in 1:55.51 for a personal best. Dave Reshef 'G, ran a season best of 1:59.53 even though he has been sick for a couple of weeks. Stephen Serene '12, ran a season best of 2:00.92. </p>
              <p align="left">Bill Phipps '10, led the way in the 1000, running a personal best of 2:31.28. Richard Prevost '11, also ran a personal best, finishing in 2:33.99. </p>
              <p align="left">Dozier came back to lead off the 4x400 relay and did well with a 51.8 opening leg. Bieniosek followed up with a 50.5 leg. Reshef ran a 50.9 with Leonard achoring in 50.7 for a cumulative 3:23.96 effort. </p>
              <p align="left">Late in the evening, in the 3000, Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, ran a 8:43.15 while teammate Dan Harper '12, ran 8:49.67.</p>
              <p align="left">In the final event of the night, the 5000, Jack Bourbonnais '10, recovered from a 32 first 200 to finish in an indoor best of 15:40.33. Freshman Ben Mattocks ran a personal best of 15:41.54. </p>
              <p align="left">Back at the <a href="coed.res.html">MIT Coed Invite</a>, where the field event competitors were going at it, Amy Magnuson showed she could still long jump even without much practice as she went 17-4 1/4. In the pole vault, Emily Hwang '09, jumped well again, clearing 11-5 1/4, while Karin Fisher '11, cleared an indoor best of 10-11 1/2. </p>
              <p align="left">On the men's side a few PRs were had. Brendan Ensor '12, hurdled his way to a 8.57. Greg Tao '10, not only won the pole vault in 14-8 3/4 he also long jumped 20-7 3/4. In the weight throw, CK Umachi '12, Jonathan Garrity '11, and Douglas Blake '12, all threw personal bests; 44-2 3/4, 38-1 1/4, 37-4 1/2 respectively.</p>
