              <p><strong><span class="style1" style="font-size: 14px">Men's Track &amp; Field Dominates New England Division III Championship</span></strong></p>
              <p align="left">February 21-22, 2014</p>
              <p align="left">MIT hosted the <a href="ned3men.res.pdf">New England Division III Indoor Track &amp; Field Championship</a> this weekend, and as defending champion, had every intention of defending the title and their home. Going into the meet as heavy favorites, the only concern for the Engineers was getting to comfortable with their position and not bringing their A game. The leadership on the team did not allow that to happen as from beginning to end there were almost no competitive situations for MIT that did not turn out well. In the end the Engineers won with 138 points to 94 for runner-up Tufts, with Bates in third with 59 points. </p>
              <p align="left">Tech track &amp; field only won two of the 20 events, although they scratched from the 4x400 relay due to how far ahead they were at the end of the meet, which they were favored to win. They also finished second in six others and had multiple place winners (top eight) in eight events. It was truly a dominating performance.</p>
              <p align="left">Things got started on Friday with the first four events of the Heptathlon. MIT was seeded to get nine points from Jordan Mizerak '14 and Adrian Samsel '16 using the eight place scoring system of 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1. Literally and figuratively, right out of the blocks, Samsel showed he came to play, running a personal best 7.42 for the 60 meter dash. Mizerak, missing a good bit of training the past few weeks due to a stress reaction, was nevertheless only .04 off his best, also running 7.42. In the second event, the Long Jump, both popped personal bests, with Samsel jumping 21-6 3/4 and Mizerak leaping 20-10 1/2. The magic continued for Samsel when he threw the shot 37-6 1/2 for yet another PR to move into the lead. Mizerak suffered a 28-11 1/4 toss to lose ground, falling to seventh place. In the final event of the day, Samsel just missed a PR, but did get a season best by jumping 6-0 3/4 in the High Jump while Mizerak held his own, clearing 5-10 1/2.</p>
              <p align="left">Saturday morning the 12 hepathletes were back at it, starting with the 60HH. Samsel started where he left off, running a PR of 8.78. Mizerak was quite a bit off his best, but did not lose any places overall with his 9.32. The Pole Vault was the next sub-event, something Mizerak had been waiting for. Mizerak could not miss and over two and half hours later, he finally ended it with a 14-11 successful vault, a huge personal best. Samsel, of course, vaulted a PR of 11-11 3/4. Mizerak moved up to fourth while Samsel had a solid hold on first. The final event, the 1000 meters saw solid performances from both athletes with Samsel running 2:48.18 and Mizerak crossing the line in 2:52.51. The 15 points gave MIT a nice start and a lead they would never relinquish. Samsel's total of 4796 is ranked 13th on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p align="left">Both the Long Jump and the Weight Throw started at the beginning of the meet. In the Weight Throw, Ken Cooper '15, ranked fifth in the country for Division III, and second in the meet, threw 60-11 1/2 to match his seed, earning eight points. Carrington Motley '16 and a fatigued Samsel added seven more points by placing fifth and sixth respectively with personal bests of 21-7 1/4 in the Long Jump, an event in which MIT was not seeded to score.</p>
              <p align="left">On the track, the trials of the 60HH and 200 were taking place. Michael Kaba '16, not seeded to make finals or to score in the hurdles, defied the odds, running 8.56 to make the finals. Later in the meet, after he also qualified in the 200 with a trials run of 22.94 on the tight-turn, flat 200 meter track, he placed fourth with a new personal best of 8.36. Also qualifying for the finals in the 200 were Tyler Singer-Clark '14, who ran 22.67 and States Lee '16, running 23.03.</p>
              <p align="left">After the hurdles, the 400 took place. This is certainly one of MIT's strong events, but Kaba was mentally fatigued after two hurdle races and his 200 trial, and two others were either sick or just coming off a sickness. Nevertheless, Singer-Clark and Lee came back from the 200 trial, placing second and third respectively, running amazing flat track times of 49.81 and 49.83. Derek Barnes '16 earned eighth place in 51.06.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 600, Mac Gager '14, who has suffered through being sick multiple times this season, pulled it together to finish fifth in a PR 1:23.47.</p>
              <p align="left">The 800 was a loaded field, but MIT's most versatile middle-distance runner, Sam Parker '15 was hoping to win. It did not appear he truly believed he could win, but the nationally ranked runner went out with the leaders in 57 at the 400. He did not seem to own the race and it showed as his opponents dictated the strategy. Parker held on for a very respectable fourth place in 1:56.37. Harrison Hunter '15 had difficulty staying focused on racing at the end, but hung pretty tough to earn eighth place in 1:57.48.</p>
              <p align="left">The 1000 meter race looked more like short track speed skating, as half-way through the fast section, the fourth place runner went down, knocking out four other runners as well as they all hit the track hard. Fortunately, MIT was in first and third at the time and that is where they stayed. Chadd Kiggins '15 defended his title, winning in 2:30.11 and Rick Paez '15, the team's candidate for most improved, ran 2:32.85 for third.</p>
              <p align="left">About this time the Triple Jump was wrapping up. Motley, ranked 12th in the country, earned his seed with a third place effort of 45-1 3/4. In one of the few events where MIT had a seeded athlete not score, Angle Echevarria '16, after fouling twice by the smallest of margins, had what looked like a clean jump and  then buckled on his final phase, not making the pit.</p>
              <p align="left">Cooper, also seeded second in the Shot Put, had his second best throw of the season to place second. The ninth ranked shot putter nationally threw 54-7 1/2.</p>
              <p align="left">In the Pole Vault, the final field event for MIT, Mizerak had little juice left, no-heighting. Both Ian Perry '17 and Marshall Wentworth '16 cleared PR's of 13-11 1/4 to tie for fifth and seventh respectively, earning MIT more unexpected points. Ben Schreck '15, seeded first and ranked sixth in NCAA Division III at 16-0 3/4, was not able to put it all together at 15-5, settling for second place at 14-11.</p>
              <p align="left">The 200 finals were next, and Singer-Clark, seeded second and coming back after the 400, earned that place with a 22.53 performance. Kaba came back and ran a determined 22.94 for fourth place. Lee, also returning after the 400, placed fifth in 22.98.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT was not seeded to score in the 3K, but Matt Deyo '16 came close. After moving up in the pack too early, Deyo, who is not the best at following race plans, fell back quite a bit, only to finish hard in ninth place in a PR of 8:44.92.</p>
              <p align="left">Tech was seeded to score over 20 points in the 5K, but the five MIT runners did not work well together, instead seeming to work very independently, which certainly cost them. The early pace was relatively fast, but not fast enough as they were hitting 4:52 per 1600 through the 3200 meter mark. Unfortunately, Roy Wedge '14 was doing almost all of this work. Benji Xie '15, the top seed, made his move with just under 800 meters to go after running 4:44 for the third metric mile. He was not able to hold it as four opponents passed him in the final straight, placing him fifth in 15:04.46. Wedge finished in sixth in 15:05.31 and Allen Leung '15, who had fallen early in the race, earned seventh place in 15:09.80.</p>
              <p align="left">At this point MIT had a large enough lead that they did not have to run any of the three relays.  Pulling the 4x400 due to the large volume of work already run by the members of the top relay, the decision was made to compete in the Distance Medley Relay and the 4x800 Relay. In the DMR, Kiggins, running tight, came back with a solid  3:11.9 leadoff 1200 leg to put MIT in a distant second place. Danny Newman '17 delivered a 53.1 split in the 400 to get MIT a little closer.  Andrew Mullen '17 ran a fine 1:58.2 to close the gap to about 10 meters. Nick Matthews '17 ran a very game anchor 1600 leg. Going for the win, he went out in 62.2, just staying close to the lead runner from Amherst College. He slowed to 2:08 at the 800, but was still 10-15 meters down. In the third quarter it looked like he might close up the gap even though the pace slowed to 3:15.  In the final 400 the early pace wiped Matthews out, slowing to 4:27, but maintaining second place in a cumulative time of 10:30.83.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event of the meet was the 4x800. MIT had a team that could win, but some of the members on the team were not the sort who usually doubled up well, so where there competitiveness was was yet to be seen. Hunter led off, looking very good through 400 meters in 58.5. However, that was the end of it as he began his trademark action of shaking his head when he loses competitiveness. His 2:03.8 put MIT in serious arrears.  Parker took the baton and made up a lot of ground, running a very smart race to split a 1:56.9 leg. Just as MIT was back in it, Gager lost it, running a 67 second 400 after a very competitive first 400 in 59. Totally out of it, Paez got the baton and did what many others would not in that situation, he raced. Catching people and moving up in the field, Paez ran 1:57.4 to get MIT one more point, placing eighth in 8:04.27.</p>
              <p align="left">The Engineers will now focus on the NCAA Division III Championship, March 14-15 at the University of Nebraska. In the meantime, the NEICAAA Championship, pitting all New England Division I, II and III colleges against one another at Boston University are this coming weekend and the following weekend will split between the ECAC Division III Championship at Reggie Lewis and a Last Chance Qualifier at Tufts University.</p>
