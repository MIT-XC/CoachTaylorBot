    MIT AT ALL NEW ENGLANDS</span></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Team Ties for 9th With 28 Points </strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 24, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">At the NEICAAA Championships, hosted by Boston University,
    the Ball and Orji show was again on and at its best.&nbsp; Nate Ball went
    first, jumping clean through 16-0 and clearing16-3 on his third attempt,
    but missing at 16-9, winning the pole vault in the process.&nbsp; Shortly
    after the vault, Uzoma Orji launched six throws over 61' with his second
    best ever and season best of 64-7 3/4 winning the event by nearly six feet.</p>
  <p align="left">Qualifying for semi-finals on day two, David Blau and Omari
    Stephens ran 6.69 in the 55 dash and 8.10 in the 55HH respectively on the
    soft and slow infield.</p>
  <p align="left">Running but not qualifying for the finals, Eric Khatchadourian
    ran 15:22.47 in the 5000, Fivos Constantinou and Jake Ruzevick running 4:18
    and 4:22 respectively in the mile, Dan Rodgers ran 1:06.61 in the 500 and
    Blau ran 22.44 in the 200.</p>
  <p align="left">On day two, James Oleinik and Orji started things off in the
    shot put.&nbsp; Oleinik, throwing the first flight, did better than the previous
    meet but still was far from his best, throwing 45-6 1/2.&nbsp; Orji, also
    throwing well off his best, nevertheless, was second best in the field, throwing
    55-11 to give MIT eight more points and a total of 28 points for a tie in
    ninth place. </p>
  <p align="left">While the web results showed that Blau and Stephens had qualified
    for the semi-finals in their respective events, both had been told when they
    finished the trials that they had not qualified for the next round.&nbsp; It
    turned out the web results were not accurate.&nbsp; However, due to the mixup,
    Blau was given the opportunity to race.&nbsp; Stephens was not able to be
    reached to tell him he was in the semis and showed up at the track to late
    to get into the race.&nbsp; Blau ended up running 6.72 in the semis.</p>
  <p align="left">Last to compete for MIT was Joe Roy-Mayhew in the 3000. &nbsp; Running
    a very determined and competitive race, Roy-Mayhew ran to a personal best
    of 8:45.18, moving into MIT's top 10 list for the 3000 meters.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT goes back to Boston University for the prestigious
    IC4A championship.&nbsp; Orji and Ball will be competing for the final time
    before nationals.</p>
