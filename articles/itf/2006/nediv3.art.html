  <p><strong><span class="style1">SENIORS LEAD WAY IN NEW ENGLAND
    DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 18, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">With the exception of the relays, the seniors and two sophomores
    scored all the points for MIT as the Engineers finished fourth out of 25
    teams in the <a href="nediv3.res.html">New England Division III Championship</a> hosted at MIT this weekend.&nbsp;Favored
    Williams College took care of business, scoring 153 points to runner-up Tufts
    University with 131 points.&nbsp; MIT battled Bates College the entire meet
    for third place, eventually bowing out when the relays failed to produce
    the necessary competitiveness Tech runners were capable of. </p>
  <p align="left">The freshman class has proven to be one of MIT's strongest
     classes ever, represented by the fact that the class of '09 scored only
    2 1/2 points less than the class of '06 and more than the classes of '07
    and '08 combined, but failed to score a single point in open events even
    though they were seeded to score 13 points.&nbsp; In addition, with a reasonable
    opportunity to win the distance medley relay, the all freshman team failed
    to do anything that represented a competitive effort, finishing sixth in
    the 12 team field.&nbsp; The time of 10:39.52 did set a new MIT freshman
    record but that was little consolation with third place on the line.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji used his broad shoulders and tried to carry the
    team on his back but only a few would follow.&nbsp; Orji won both the 35lb.
    weight throw and the shot put with meet record efforts of 62-9 1/4 and 57-10
    respectively.&nbsp; Once his competitions were concluded he was all over
    the track supporting his teammates.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">Team support, a trademark of the MIT track and field teams
    over the years, was sorely lacking in this meet.&nbsp; Instead, Tufts University
    showed the type of support, in MIT's house, that put the Engineers to shame.&nbsp; Beginning
    with the pentathlon held on Friday, Tufts had about 20 team members supporting
    their competitors where MIT had only an occasional team member showing up
    to offer support.&nbsp; This
    continued on Saturday as MIT seemed defeated from the start.</p>
  <p align="left">Senior tri-captain, David Blau stepped up in a big way, finishing
    third in both the 55 and 200 meter dashes.&nbsp; In the 55 dash, Blau began
    the day with a personal best in the trials with a 6.59 effort.&nbsp; He then
    lined up for the 200 trials and proceeded to run a flat track best of 22.88
    to win his heat easily.&nbsp; In the finals, he ran another personal best,
    this one a 6.56 performance that required a photo reading down to the 1000th
    of a second to break what appeared to be a tie for third.&nbsp; Finally,
    in the final of the 200, Blau, running out of lane 4, ran another flat track
    best, this one in 22.70.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT was counting on the pole vault in a big way because Nate
    Ball 'G, was favored by two feet over the rest of the competition and Omari
    Stephens '08, was seeded third.&nbsp; Stephens managed 13-6, six inches under
    his best, but the other competitors were not able to jump any higher either.&nbsp; However,
    Stephens took three tries to clear the height, tying him for fourth place.&nbsp;Ball,
    opening at 15', was unable to clear on his three attempts.&nbsp; What should
    have been 16 points turned into 4 1/2.</p>
  <p align="left">Eric Khatchadourian shook off what had been a sub-standard
    season for him thus far, and raced his best indoor effort ever.&nbsp; Khatchadourian,
    seeded 15 in the 20 man 5000 meter field, went with the leaders at the start
    and never backed off.&nbsp; Fading a little in the final mile, he delivered
    with all he had to secure fourth place and hold off a fast closing Wesleyan
    runner.</p>
  <p align="left">Senior Fivos Constantinou, seeded fifth in the mile, did not
    run his best race, but he did finish well to hold onto seventh place in 4:20.13.&nbsp; All
    seniors on the team stepped up to score in this meet, Thad Wozniak taking
    care of his end in the pentathlon on Friday in the pentathlon.&nbsp; Wozniak
    scored 2915 points for eighth place, performing personal bests in the 55HH
    with a time&nbsp; of 8.59 and in the 1000 with a performance of 2:56.17. </p>
  <p align="left">Stephens was the only Tech athlete in three events.&nbsp; In
    addition to scoring in the pole vault he earned a sixth in the 55HH, running
    two personal bests on the day, 8.08 in the trials and 8.07 in the finals.&nbsp; Stephens
    also competed in the triple jump, but was not favored to score and was unable
    to do anything to change that seed.</p>
  <p align="left">One of the strongest efforts of the day went to sophomore Joe
    Roy-Mayhew in the 3000 meter race.&nbsp; Roy-Mayhew was seeded fourth based
    on his 8:46 performance at Boston University's banked track from the week
    before.&nbsp; Roy-Mayhew went out with the leaders and held on as long as
    he could, running 70-71 seconds per 400 for the entire race before kicking
    it in for fifth place in 8:48.89.</p>
  <p align="left">The final points of the day came from the 4x800 relay.&nbsp; At
    this point, in order to defeat Bates, MIT needed to finish first while second
    place would tie with them.&nbsp; Constantinou was not competitive after the
    first 400, racing from the back and leaving the team in a severe deficit
    in seventh place with his 2:03 effort.&nbsp; Aron
    Walker '07, made a move in the final 400 but his 2:03 left MIT in only sixth
    place. David Reshef ran a courageous 2:01, moving MIT up to fifth place as
    he handed the baton off the Matt Bieniosek.&nbsp;Bieniosek ran a 2:00 despite
    a first 200 in 26 seconds, but actually lost a place to a fast anchor from
    Amherst College.</p>
  <p align="left">Despite the efforts of the senior class, MIT fell five points
    short of third place.&nbsp; Letting this opportunity slip away will hopefully
    make the freshman class stronger eventually and better prepared to scored
    in the meet in the future.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, a dozen or so competitors with go over to Boston
    University for the NEICAAA Championship, an all division New England Championship
    in which MIT finished 9th last year.&nbsp; Most of the trials and a few finals
    will compete on Friday with the shot put and finals of most running events
    being held on Saturday.</p>
