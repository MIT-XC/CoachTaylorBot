    IC4A WEIGHT THROW VICTORY</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">March 4-5, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">With only two <a href="http://www.lancertiming.com/results/winter06/ic4a.htm">IC4A</a> qualifiers,
    MIT was previewing what it would be like at next week's NCAA Division III
    Championship at this weekend's IC4A championship being held at Boston University.&nbsp; Nate
    Ball, seeded third at the IC4A championship is tied for third seed at the
    NCAA championship.&nbsp; Uzoma Orji, seeded third in the weight throw and
    fourth in the shot put at the IC4A championship is seeded second and first
    respectively at the NCAA championship.&nbsp; The opportunity to score a record
    number of points in the modern era was at hand.</p>
  <p align="left">Ball led off in the vault.&nbsp; Looking good in warmups, Ball
    was unable to make it work.&nbsp; Unable to clear a height, Ball has to settle
    for waiting until next week to put it all together.&nbsp; Orji started slow
    in the 35lb. weight throw, finishing fourth after the trials.&nbsp; On his
    first throw of the finals, Orji threw 63' to move into third place.&nbsp; On
    his second throw he took over the lead with a 64' 9 effort.&nbsp; On his
    final throw he put the event away with a new MIT record of 65' 1 1/2 to become
    Tech's first ever IC4A weight throw winner and the first champion in any
    event in the modern era (since 1960).</p>
  <p align="left">In the shot put, Orji could not find the position in the front
    of the circle to be able to really put everything into the throw.&nbsp; After
    the trials he was in fourth position with a throw of 55-2 1/4.&nbsp; In the
    finals Orji could not improve his mark and was passed by one thrower.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
    his 14 points was certainly pretty incredible at this very prestigious meet. </p>
  <p align="left">Next week, Orji and Ball head to St. Olaf College in Northfield,
    Minnesota for the NCAA Division III.&nbsp; The pole vault and weight throw
    will be contested on Friday and the shot put on Saturday.&nbsp; Schedule
    and results can be found at http://www.stolaf.edu/athletics/ncaatr/schedule.htm</p>
