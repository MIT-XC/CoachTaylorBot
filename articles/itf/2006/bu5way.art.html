    I COMPETITION</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 6, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">MIT took a break from their traditional Division III competition,
    moving over to the very nice Boston University indoor track and field facility
    to compete against Boston College, Boston University, Northeastern University
    and Providence College in a non-scoring meet.&nbsp; Having defeated these
    same teams last year in this meet, the Engineers were looking forward to
    the opportunity of a scoring meet.&nbsp; However, with Jake Ruzevick out
    sick and Fivos Constantinou nursing a groin injury, the result may not have
    been as favorable for Tech.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT pulled out four victories, all in the field events.&nbsp; Nate
    Ball led the way with a new personal indoor best and new MIT indoor record
    of 16-6 in the pole vault.&nbsp; Ball's jump made the automatic standard
    for the NCAA Division III Championship next month.&nbsp; Uzoma Orji continued
    his undefeated ways, winning both the weight throw and the shot put.&nbsp; The
    unexpected victory came from Omari Stephens in the triple jump.&nbsp; Stephens
    set a personal best en route to his 42-02 1/2 victory.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT garnered few top places in the meet, but David Blau managed
    to get two of them.&nbsp; Blau ran 6.73 on the slow sprint surface to claim
    second in the 55 dash and 22.62 in the 200 to claim third.&nbsp; In two events
    MIT claimed a 1-2 victory.&nbsp; Anthony Teixeira supported Stephens' triple
    jump effort with a second place finish and James Oleinik finished second
    to Orji in the shot put with yet another personal best of 48-01 1/2.</p>
  <p align="left">In addition, there were some remarkable performances turned
    in by Tech.&nbsp;Constantinou turned in a courageous effort in the mile despite
    his groin problems.&nbsp; Coming off a slow third quarter, Constantinou ran
    a 61 final 400 to record a 4:16.52 fourth place finish.&nbsp; In the one
    distance event of the evening, Joe Roy-Mayhew ran a consistent pace and set
    a huge personal best in the 3000 of 8:46.53.</p>
  <p align="left">Other strong performances were accomplished by Matt Bieniosek
    in the 800 (1:58.98), Thad Wozniak in the 200 (23.01), Ryan King in the 3000
    (9:07.50), Aron Walker in the 500 (1:08.65) and Stephen Oney in the 55 (6.81).</p>
  <p align="left">This coming Saturday, MIT will split their squad, sending some
    to the Boston University Valentine's Meet while keeping others at home for
    the MIT Coed Invitational.</p>
