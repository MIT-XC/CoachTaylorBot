  NATIONAL FIELD ATHLETE OF THE YEAR </span></strong></p>
</div>
<p><br>
  March 10-11, 2006<br>
  <a href="ncaa.res.html">NCAA Championships</a></p>
<p><br>
  Uzoma Orji has been carrying the MIT team the entire season and nothing changed
    at the NCAA Division III Championship, hosted by St. Olaf College in Northfield,
    Minnesota.&nbsp; Uzoma matched his seeds, earning second place in the weight
    throw and first in the shot put to score 18 points by himself, leading the
    team to an eighth place finish and first among New England colleges. </p>
<p>The men's weight throw competition started slow but finished as one of the
    most competitive events ever in this meet.&nbsp; Uzoma got in a relaxed mark
    on his first throw of 58' .75" which was certainly
    not going to win anything but relaxed the nerves. Kevin Becker from UW La
    Crosse immediately following was able to get a mark of 58' 7.5" to the applause
    of the crowd. Probably under the assumption that if he got one in the sector
  he would be able to win after fouling-out last year as the heavy favorite and
    fouling out last weekend at the WIAC Championships. After that round only
    Brandon Houle from UW Oshkosh had a respectable throw at 60' 5.25".<br>
  <br>
  On the second round Uzoma let loose with a 63' 11" throw which seemed to rattle
  everyone else. Becker fouled his second attempt and needed a farther
  mark to ensure a spot in finals. On Uzoma's third attempt he unleashed a huge
  throw but unfortunately was not able to stay in the circle. Becker stepped
  up and threw a new NCAA record of 66' 9.5" to take the lead. Brandon Houle
  improved his throw to 61' 11.75" thus ending the first
  flight.<br>
  <br>
  The second flight featured three throwers over 60'. Dan Austin from Williams
  was able to throw 60' 6.5" on his first attempt. Jim Uppena from UW Platteville
  improved upon his seed by throwing 63' 5.5" on his third attempt after Anderson
  College's Dwayne Lockridge was able to tie Uzoma with a 63' 11" second attempt
  throwing a near two meter personal best.<br>
  <br>
  Due to Lockridge's second-best throw beating Uzoma's second-best throw Uzoma
  entered finals in third. Finals started with a fury as three of the first five
  throwers improved their marks. Dan Austin actually went from 6th to 8th before
  he even got his first attempt. Brandon Houle threw 63' 4.75" on his first attempt
  as Uppena, and Lockridge were unable to improve.&nbsp; Uzoma managed another
  better throw but was unable to stay in the circle on an extremely close call
  on the front rim.&nbsp; Becker stepped up and improved his throw to 68' 3.75" which
  would be his best on the day.<br>
  <br>
  The second round of finals was relatively quiet except for Uzoma's huge sector
  foul. On his last turn he was again heavy on his right and had a flight phase
  on his left which appeared to force his throw out the left side. While several
  feet out of the sector it appeared that this throw was farther than Becker's
  record. He knew he had the distance for at least a big personal best but he
  also knew he only had one chance left.<br>
  <br>
  In the last round Brandon Houle improved his mark to 63' 11" becoming the third
  thrower to be at that mark.&nbsp; Due to his second-best throw he moved up
  from fifth to second place. Uzoma stepped up on his last attempt to change
  that. While his attempt certainly wasn't the best looking throw of the day
  it got the job done with 63' 6.5" beating Houle's second mark moving Uzoma
  from fourth to second.</p>
<p>In the pole vault, Nate Ball came in at 15-1 3/4, clearing it on his first
  attempt.&nbsp; At
  15-7 3/4, Nate needed two attempts to clear but felt as though he was jumping
  well.&nbsp; At 16-1 3/4 Nate was well over the bar on his attempts but could
  not get the standards set in a position so that he would not come down on them.&nbsp; Finishing
  in a tie for 9th was very frustrating for the two time All America winner as
  he ends his collegiate career. </p>
<p>In the shot put Uzoma was favored to win by a large margin but coming into
  the meet was shaky with some mediocre meets over the last three weeks. In the
  first flight everyone seemed to be flat as the best throw was Uzoma's at 55'
  3.5&quot;. In the second flight Alex Kampersol from Springfield College threw
  a big personal best to tie Uzoma. With his better second throw Kampersol was
first going into finals.</p>
<p>Uzoma knew he had to hit a throw and put this away. With a loud yell Uzoma
  threw 57' 11.25&quot; essentially putting first place out of reach. Some other
  throwers would move up but when Uzoma stepped into the circle and delivered
  a 58' 3.75&quot; he knew it was his and let out a yell that caught everyone's
  attention. Going into his last throw the entire crowd started to clap for him
  and he called them out while in the circle to get louder. He wasn't able to
  improve on his final throw but added a solid 57' 7 in winning the national
  title by nearly two feet.</p>
<p>Uzoma was named Field Performer of the NCAA Championship for the third time
  indoors and was awarded Regional Field Athlete of the Year as well as National
  Field Athlete of the Year, a first for a MIT track and field athlete.&nbsp; With
  one season to go in his remarkable career, Uzoma has won three national titles
  and 10 all america honors.</p>
