The Varsity had too many bodies and a little too much quality for the Alumni. The Varsity men won <a href="alumnil.res.php">the meet</a> 77 to 45 and the women won 78-40.</p>              <p align="left">While there were no national qualifying marks for the men, there were 22 New England Division III qualifying marks. For the women, there was one NCAA Division III provisional mark and 26 New England Division III qualifying marks.</p>              <p align="left">Hazel Briner '11, won the pentathlon, qualifying provisionally for the NCAAs in the only intercollegiate event of the day, and one that did not score in the alumni meet. Briner's 3122 easily eclipsed the provisional standard of 3000 points. Briner's best performance came in the high jump where she cleared a personal best of 5-1. Within the pentathlon, Briner qualified individually in the 55HH, high jump and shot put for the NE Division III Championship. Freshmen, Holly Chamberlain and Diana Zhu also qualified for the New England Division III pentathlon, scoring 2288 and 2217 points respectively.</p>              <p align="left">With no throwers entered in the meet for the varsity, the alumnae took advantage, placing first and second in both with non-throwers (Emily Hwang '09, Meredith Silberstein '05, and Julia Zimmerman '09) earning the 16 points. Likewise, the alumnae were unable to field entries in the 55HH and the 400, allowing the varsity to earn 17 unchallenged points with Portia Jones '12, and Amy Magnuson '10, going 1-2 in the 55HH and Jamie Simmons '12, leading Martha Gross '12, and Kirsten Aarsvold '11 to the finish line. The remaining events were quite competitive.</p>              <p align="left">The primary women's event for pure qualifying marks  was the pole vault. Six of the varsity participants earned New England Division III qualifying marks. Led by Briner's 10-11 1/2, who came back after the pentathlon to compete in her favorite event, the varsity earned first and third, earned by Karin Fisher '11. Also qualifying were Lynn Jepsen '11, Becky Stavely '12, Caroline Figgatt '11 and Lauren Kuntz '13.</p>              <p align="left">The only other victories earned by the alumnae were in the long jump by Silberstein with a 15-10 1/4 leap and Andrea Bradshaw '09, winning the 800 with a 2:22.10.</p>              <p align="left">Other Varsity victories were earned by Jones in the high jump (4-10 1/4) and 200 (26.30), Magnuson in the triple jump (33-2), Brooke Johnson '13, in the mile (5:18.69), Tania Morimoto in the 5000 (18:10.43) and the quartet of Margaret Leibovic '10, Simmons, Gross and Jones in the 4x200 (1:49.21).</p>              <p align="left">The other alumnae competing were Karen Davie '08, Chi-Fong Wang '07, Allison Houghton '08, Adrienne Bolger '08, Erika Erickson '09, Adeline Kuo '02, and Elizabeth Finn '09.</p>              <p align="left">Stephen Morton '10, led the way for the Varsity men, earning three victories and qualifying for the New England Division III Championships in each event. Morton sprinted away from teammates Rene Peters '13 (6.73) and Josh Duncavage '13 (6.74) with a 6.62 effort in the 55 dash. In the long jump he leaped 21-7 1/2 to outdistance teammates Mattias Flander '11 (20-3 1/2), and Peters (19-1 1/2) for an MIT sweep despite all doing a short approach. Morton led another Varsity sweep in the triple jump with a 44-11 3/4 jump to lead Flander (44-1 1/2) and Wirekoh '13 (41-8 1/2).</p>              <p align="left">Similar to the women, the pole vault was the event that produced the most New England Division III qualifiers with five surpassing the 12-9 standard. Nathan Peterson '12, led Greg Tao '10, Justin Schmidt '10, Yida Gao '13, and Ian Fischer '12 in qualifying despite a short approach.</p>              <p align="left">The throwers were a big plus for the Varsity. While Uzoma Orji '06, won both the weight throw (54-00 1/2) and shot put (50-08 1/4), MIT had three New England Division III qualifiers in both events. In the weight throw Adam Mustafa '11, CK Umachi '12, and Tony McDonald '10 all qualified, while in the shot put, James Oleinik 'G, Mitch Kelley '11, and McDonald surpassed the qualifying mark.</p>              <p align="left">Other winners for the &quot;Has-Beens were Nate Ball '05, in the pole vault (15-4 1/2), Craig Mielcarz '03, in the high jump (6-0), Zach Traina '05, in the 200 (23.30), Ben Schmeckpeper '05, in the 5000 (15:28.00) and Yermie Cohen '09, earning victories in both the very strategic Mile (4:26.63) and the 800 (1:56.69). Despite winning eight of the 14 events, the alumni were not able to stay close as they only scored five non-winning points, with Patrick Barragan '08, earning third in the vault, Andy Ugarov '95, placing third in the high jump and Traina placing second in the 55.</p>              <p align="left">Varsity victories that were earned by someone other than Morton were DJ Ronde '13, taking the 400 with a fine time of 51.88, Brian Djaja '13, taking the 55HH with a 8.28 and the quartet of Nick Leonard '11, Pat Marx '13, John Granata '11, and Ronde sprinting to the 4x200 victory.</p>              <p align="left">Others representing the Alumni were Kevin Scannell '91, Hung Hoang '96, Bill Singhose '90, Dan Kwon '04, Omari Stephens '08, Dave Reshef '09, Matt Lehman '04, Ulzie Rea '09, David Blau '06, Eric Khatchadourian '06, Peter Mulligan '08, Matt Bieniosek '09, Joe Roy-Mayhew '08 and Terry McNatt '87.</p>              <p align="left">Next Saturday, MIT plays host to Bates College and Colby College with events beginning at 12:00 noon.</p>              <p align="center"><a href="../itfsched.php">RETURN TO INDOOR</a> </p>          </div>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>      </table></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
