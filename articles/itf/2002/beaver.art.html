Championship Qualifying Marks</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>January 12, 2001</P>

<P>The MIT Men's Track team led the way in the Beaver Relays with 13
New England Division III qualifying performances and 2 NCAA Division
III qualifying marks. In addition, a new freshman record was
established in the 200 and another nearly made in the pole vault.
Zach Traina, ran 23.16 to smash the record in the 1 lapper by .15
seconds. Nate Ball, after making 14-6 in the vault, attempted 14-9 in
an effort to get the 14-8 record. After a poor plant on his second
attempt, which almost led to an injury, Nate did not seem to have the
same aggressiveness on his final effort. It is just a matter of time
before the record falls this season.</P>

<P>MIT hosts this annual invitational meet, which is non-scoring,
features a pentathlon in the morning and gets the cobwebs out after a
long holiday break. The meets results showed what you would expect,
some worked hard over the holiday and some did not.</P>

<P>The goal for the Division III pentathletes was to score at least
2900 points so they could qualify for the New England Division III
Championships in February. Rick Rajter, returning just this week from
a 7 week layoff due to back problems, led the way for the Engineers
with 3344 points. Rick lost at least 200 points in the 1000 meters
due to his lack of endurance, but should have that back in a few
weeks. En route to his score, Rick also qualified in two other events
with a hurdle time of 7.95 and a high jump of 6-4.</P>

<P>Craig Mielcarz did pretty well himself in the pentathlon with a
score of 3267, jumping 6-8 3/4 during the high jump portion to
qualify provisionally for the NCAA Division III Championship. Rookie,
Victor Williamson, participating in his first pentathlon scored 2916
to squeak into the Championship. Missing the mark by 1 point was
freshman Tom Hoover, and Adrian Townsend missed the magic total by 24
points. Two time Div. III Championship scorer, Peter Bluvas, missed
the competition due to a sore hamstring.</P>

<P>In the 35 pound weight throw, Chris Khan threw 52-1 to
provisionally qualify for the NCAA meet. After missing last year due
to injury, Chris is making the most of his freshman year of
eligibility. He also threw 44-7 in the shot put as he won both
events. Also throwing well was sophomore David Saylor who threw 46-0
1/4 with the weight to qualify for the NE Div. III meet. Transfer
Dale Cotton, threw 41-4 1/2 in the shot after not throwing in over 20
months.</P>

<P>In the vault, In additional to Ball jumping 14-6, Dan Kwon cleared
14-0 to qualify for both the NE Div. III meet and the All New
Englands. </P>

<P>The Techmen showed a lot of depth in the dash with 5 sprinters
breaking 7.00 in the 55 meter event. Zach Traina led the way with a
6.72 PR and was followed by Marc Washington with a 6.87 after missing
6 weeks due to an ankle sprain. Robbie Gray ran 6.91, Brandon Hohm
6.99 and Dave Kloster 6.99. </P>

<P>Yuval Mazor and Matt Lehman both broke 51 seconds for the first
time indoors, running 50.79 and 50.89 respectively. Freshman Gabe
Sanchez ran 52.41 to show his hard work is starting to pay off. The
three combined with freshman Jesse Alejandro to run a very
respectable 3:26.11 in the 1600 Relay.</P>

<P>Junius Ho won the 55HH event with a technically sound race, that
was not quite as fast as it looked, as he ran away from the field
with a 8.26 clocking.</P>

<P>Brian Anderson took the lead in the 800 and never looked back,
running 1:55.36 to win by over 4 seconds. Alan Raphael finished
second in 1:59.60. Mark Jeunnette ran 2:00.46 for third and George
Hanson ran a very competitive 2:01.13 for fourth.</P>

<P>Sean Montgomery was in great control of the mile, running 63
second splits threw the first three quarters, but then fell off at
the end, running 4:18.30 for an easy victory.</P>

<P>The distance runners did their job, winning both the 3000 and 5000
meter runs. Dan Feldman won the 5000 with a 15:13.75 and Sean Nolan
ran a 8:42.27 in a comeback kick to catch Ian Bartonicek from the
Coast Guard Academy at the line by .02.</P>

<P>Next week, the team is again at home as they play host to Bates
College and the Coast Guard Academy. This will be the first
intercollegiate scoring meet of the season.</P>
