BOSTON MEET</B></FONT>

Score</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>February 2, 2002</P>

<P>In 1992, the Greater Boston Championship (GBC) was disbanded. What
used to be a very exciting track and field meet, pitting the area
colleges against one another is back. Boston University hosted the
renewed championship. Northeastern University took control of the
meet early on with a combination of strength in the field events,
sprints and hurdles to total a score of 133.5 points. MIT, powered by
the 800-5000 events, in which they scored 40 of their 81.5 points,
placed 2nd, just ahead of Harvard with 79 points, BU with 51, Bentley
with 12 and Brandeis with 2 points.</P>

<P>After the all out effort last week against Williams College, MIT
was careful to rest any athletes who were ill or even a little
injured. Without a few of their top performers, Tech did not expect
to have such success against Harvard and BU. In addition, MIT,
uncharacteristically gave up some easy points, particularly in the
long jump due to poor performances.</P>

<P>What did go well were the middle distance and distance events.
Sean Montgomery and Brian Anderson started things off in the mile
run. After a slow pace at the half way mark, coming through in 2:08,
Montgomery and Jochen Dieckfoss from BU went at it for the next 800
meters. The two came through the three quarter mark in 3:10 and kept
picking the pace up. Montgomery was never able to close the final 5
meters as Dieckfoss won in 4:10.31. Montgomery finished in 4:11.65 to
automatically qualify for the NCAA Championships next month. Anderson
fell off the pace with a quarter to go but still managed to even
split a 4:15.98 for 4th place, which provisionally qualified him for
nationals.</P>

<P>Forty minutes later, the two were back at it in the 800 meter run.
This time Anderson took the pace out, coming through splits of 27, 55
and 1:24. Montgomery was the only one to go out with Anderson, slowly
working his way up to him with 250 meters to go. Montgomery took the
lead a ran a personal indoor best of 1:53.47 for the victory. Again,
the time qualified him provisionally for nationals, which handicaps
the performances on banked tracks. Anderson finished 2nd in 1:54.72,
just missing provisional qualification.</P>

<P>The distance runners decided to go one up on the middle distance
runners, with both Sean Nolan and Dan Feldman smashing the varsity
record with times of 14:32.68 and 14:33.80 respectively for 1st and
2nd place. Both performances made the automatic standard for the NCAA
Championship. Not to be overlooked, freshman Ben Schmeckpeper found
his groove and just missed provisional qualification with a 4th place
time of 14:56.66.</P>

<P>Second place performances were also achieved by Craig Mielcarz in
the High Jump (6'6"), Dan Opila in the Pole Vault (13'9") and Chris
Khan in the Weight Throw (54'4"), who improved his provisional
qualifying mark for nationals.</P>

<P>Freshman Nathan Ball placed third in the Pole Vault, also clearing
13'9". The two relay teams, DMR and 1600 Relay, both placed third. On
the DMR, Jesse Alejandro showed he is getting back to his 800 form
with a 1:56 split. In the 1600 Relay, the quartet of Yuval Mazor,
Matt Lehman, Gabe Sanchez and Montgomery ran a provisionally
qualifying time of 3:20.45 for their fastest effort of the
season.</P>

<P>Additional scores and personal bests were achieved by; Mazor and
Lehman in the 400 with respective times of 50.18 and 50.52 for 4th
and 6th place, Marios Michalakis earning a 6th in the Weight Throw
with a 46-11 effort, Francisco Cruz with a 42-8 3/4 heave in the Shot
Put for 6th place, Austin Neudecker and Victor Williamson combining
for 4th and 5th in the Triple Jump with respective leaps of 43-0 1/2
and 42-10 1/4, Dan Kwon with a 6th place leap of 12-3 1/2 in the
Vault and a tie for 6th by Rick Rajter in the High Jump with a 6-2
effort.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT will split their squad, sending a loaded DMR, Craig
Mielcarz in the High Jump and Zach Traina in the 200, to BU for the
annual Valentines Meet, and hosting the MIT Coed Invitational for
Coast Guard, University of Rochester, Colby College, Connecticut
College and WPI.</P>
