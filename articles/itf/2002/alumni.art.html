TRIUMPH OVER THE ALUMNI</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>December 15, 2001</P>

<P>Sean Montgomery (10), Craig Mielcarz (11) and Zach Traina (11 1/4)
led the way in scoring to a 91-31 victory over the Alumni in this
annual meet. However, Sean Nolan, determined to exorcise the demons
that plagued him at the NCAA Division III National Cross Country
Championship, led the way in performances with an outstanding
14:53.43 5000 meter victory to provisionally qualify for
nationals.</P>

<P>A much leaner John Wallberg, started things off right for the
Alumni when he won the 35 lb. weight throw with a 49-0 1/2 effort.
John also captured the shot put with a 44-8 3/4 throw to become the
only double winner for the "has-beens". Akin Aina also performed well
for the Alumni as he secured second place in both the 55 and 200
meter dashes. Not the same Bill Singhose of old, he nevertheless came
through for two big second place efforts in the pole vault and long
jump. The only other first place winner for the old guys was Morio
Alexander in the triple jump with a huge 42-11 1/2 leap. Other
scorers for the Alumni were first time has-been, Kalpak Kothari (2nd
in the triple jump) and Todd Chamoy (3rd in the weight throw). Others
competing, but not placing, were; Keith Bevans and Patrick Dannen in
the shot put, Sam Sidiqi and Steve Lefkowitz in the pole vault, Jared
Miller in the long and triple jumps, Josh Feldman, Liyan Guo and
Steven Linder in the 5000, Bob Collins in the 1500 and Todd
Rosenfield in the 400.</P>

<P>Using the old 5-3-1 scoring format, the Alumni kept things close
in the early field events, but were outmanned in the running events
longer than the 200. Sweeps in the 400, 800, 1500, 5000 and 55HH were
too much for the Alumni.</P>

<P>The Varsity represented itself well with outstanding performances
in the 800 and 5000 meter races. Sean Montgomery, recovered from his
4:02.6 1500 victory, led the attack in the 800 with a 1:55.83 and was
closely followed by Brian Anderson (1:57.27), Alan Raphael (1:57.41)
and Mark Jeunnette (1:57.81). In the 5000, trailing Nolan were Dan
Feldman in 15:00.50, Albert Liu (15:36.33) and Ben Schmeckpeper
(15:52.83).</P>

<P>Zach Traina not only won both the 55 and 200 meter races, he tied
the 200 meter freshman record in the 200 with a 23.31 effort. Craig
Mielcarz did not set any records but he did win the high jump in 6-6
and the high hurdles in 8.19 while placing 3rd in the long jump at
20-9 1/4.</P>

<P>Other New England Division III qualifying performances were turned
in by Dan Kwon in the pole vault (13-6) and Marios Michalakis in the
weight throw (46-4 1/4).</P>

<P>The MIT trackmen are off for exams next week and then leave for
their holiday break. The next meet will be a home contest on January
12 versus Coast Guard, Fitchburg State and Southern Maine in the
Beaver Relays.</P>
