<P>February 9, 2002</P>

<P>This weekend's meets were supposed to serve three purposes for the
MIT Engineers. One, the Distance Medley Relay team was going to try
and qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship in March. Two, the
goal of qualifying a total of seven pentathletes for the New England
Division III Championship was sought in order to continue the
domination of that event for Tech. Three, since both meets were
non-scoring, the opportunity to rest, sharpen and in some cases
qualify for next weekend's championship, was a high priority.</P>

<P>Sean Montgomery made the first goal reality by running a 4:03 mile
to anchor a record breaking, national qualifying Distance Medley
Relay in 9:53.16 at the Valentine's Classic at Boston University.
Sophomore, Brian Anderson led the relay off with a 3:00.47 1200 leg,
certainly worthy of headlines by itself. Brian ran within 1 second of
the varsity 1000 record en route to his 1200 split. Yuval Mazor
followed up with a 49.96 400 and handed off to freshman Jesse
Alejandro with a healthy lead over the Syracuse Chargers. Jesse, very
nervous and thinking a bit too much, did not respond well to the
Syracuse runners 1:49 leg, falling off to 1:59 and well off the pace,
but good for a freshman in such a big race. Sean Montgomery took
over, running a 57.7 first quarter to make up half the distance.
After coming through splits of 1:59 and 3:02, Sean caught the
Syracuse team. Making two valid attempts to pass in the final 300
meters, Sean was unable to do so, but did manage to close with a 61
quarter for a 4:03.74 anchor.</P>

<P>Back at MIT, the pentathletes took care of the second goal by
stealing the show in the morning session , placing 1-2-3-4, all
scoring over 2900 points. On the way, all four reached season or
personal bests in the long jump and three of the four had bests in
the shot put. MIT has three pentathletes who had already qualified
for the New England Division III Championship this coming weekend and
they did not compete on this day. Of the four competing today, Peter
Bluvas had been injured in January when the others qualified. Adrian
Townsend (4th) and Tom Hoover (3rd) had just missed the 2900 mark in
their previous outing. Junius Ho (2nd) was participating in his first
pentathlon ever and showed he has a lot of potential. MIT now has
seven qualifiers in this event for this weekend's Championship.</P>

<P>Continuing to show the jumpers were back where they were supposed
be, Robbie Gray regained his form just in time for the Championships
with a 21-6 1/2 victory. Freshman Austin Neudecker was not to be
outdone, as he took the victory in his specialty the Triple Jump.
Austin got better each jump as he closed out the competition with a
45-1 3/4 performance. Overall, fouls were virtually nonexistent for
the first time this season for the Engineers. Freshman vaulters Nate
Ball, Nestor Hernandez and Dan Walker all showed their best at the
right time. Nate cleared 14-6 and just missed clearing 15-1. Nestor
improved to 13-3 to qualify for next weekend's Division III
Championship. Dan cleared 12-6 for a big PR in his final meet this
season.</P>

<P>Francisco Cruz found what he has been looking for for nearly two
years when he threw 44-2 1/4 in the Shot Put to place second. Chris
Khan won the Weight Throw with a 1 turn 52-11 throw, but could not
put together a good two turn effort. Marios Michalakis did not have
that problem as he improved nearly three feet with a 49-6 1/2 PR for
second place. Obviously, the third goal was accomplished as well.</P>

<P>On the track, numerous PRs were also being attained. Dave Kloster
and Brandon Hohm ran personal bests in the 55 dash with times of 6.88
and 6.98 respectively. Kloster came back in the 200 with another
indoor personal best of 24.39. Taku Iida ran a season best in the 800
with a 2:07.24. Sean Nolan took a weekend off from the distance wars
to try his speed at the 1500. The pace was slow through 1200 meters
with a split time of 3:16 but Sean still managed a PR of 4:04.57.
Jeff Billing ran a strong 3000 in 9:16.92 to show his ability to race
effectively from the 800-5000 distances. Craig Wildman broke 16:00
for the first time in the 5000 and did it in a big way with a
15:48.65 for second place behind teammate Albert Liu.</P>

<P>Next weekend, the team will travel to Bates College, in Lewiston,
Maine for the New England Division III Championship. The team won the
meet in 2000, but finished a close 2nd last year. They hope to regain
the Championship as they send 33 qualified athletes to get the job
done.</P>
