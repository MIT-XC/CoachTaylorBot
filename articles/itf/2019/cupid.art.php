            <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold">Is This Version of  MIT Track &amp; Field  of Championship Caliber?</span></p>
            <p align="left">February 1-2, 2018</p>
            <p align="left">MIT Track &amp; Field has dominated New England Division III Track &amp; Field for much of the past 10 years, particularly over the past five years where the women have won three of the past five indoor titles and six consecutive outdoor titles while the men have also won three of the past five indoor titles as well as the past five outdoor titles.&nbsp; However, both the men and women finished second last year, the men losing to Tufts and the women to Williams in the Indoor Championship.&nbsp; While many of the stars from the past years are still performing at a championship caliber, some are not quite there as yet, mentally or physically.&nbsp; In addition to the injuries that have sidelined some national level student-athletes, there may not be the necessary depth to handle the relays and extra points that are part of any successful championship team unless some others show more consistency.</p>
            <p align="left">A few field athletes representing MIT competed at the <a href="neicaaa.res.php">New England Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association (NEICAAA) Championship</a> being held at the Reggie Lewis Center in Boston&nbsp;while most of the team who were not taking the weekend off from competing, competed at <a href="cupid.res.php">Tufts University in the Cupid Challenge</a>.&nbsp; At Reggie Lewis, Kari Stromhaug '19 led the way for Tech, placing second in the Pole Vault with&nbsp;a season best 12-5 1/2, placing her fourth on the NCAA D3 list.&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing fourth was freshman Anais Marenco '22, clearing a personal best of 12-1 1/2 to join MIT's indoor top-ten list.&nbsp; Jacqueline Ahrens '21, still trying to figure out what is missing, cleared 11-7 3/4.</p>
            <p align="left">The other athlete who placed at&nbsp;the NEICAAA Championship was Yorai Shaoul '21, who placed fifth in the Long Jump.&nbsp; Although he was credited with a 23-2 performance, the sophomore had a foul&nbsp;or two that were in the 24 foot range.</p>
            <p align="left">Over at Tufts, there were strong performances, as well as some that showed potential but were thwarted by&nbsp;inward thinking or poor strategy.&nbsp; Andrew Mah '22 got things going in the strong performances category for MIT in the 5K.&nbsp; The freshman had been down with a knee irritation for the past three weeks, but showed that his competitiveness could overcome a lack of fitness, at&nbsp;least for most of the race.&nbsp; Going out with&nbsp;the leaders, although at the back of the pack, Mah ran a very well paced first 1600 in 4:42.&nbsp; As those in front of him slowed, Mah moved up in the field&nbsp;with a second 1600 in 4:41.&nbsp; He continued this pace for the next 800 meters before the fatigue hit him and hit him big.&nbsp; He did not lose focus, so was able to hold onto 73-74 pace for the final 1000 to finish in fourth in 14:49.27.&nbsp; In the next section, Finn Jacobson-Schulte '21 had a big breakthrough and Alex Knoedler '18 made his season debut upon his return from injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacobson-Schulte not only put himself in a nice racing position with 5:00 pace the entire race, finishing in 15:36.28--a huge personal best.&nbsp; Knoedler was a second or two ahead of Jacobson-Schulte through 3600 meters, but tightened up in the final 1400, finishing a solid 15:41.42.&nbsp;&nbsp;Emily Skilling '21 ran a personal best in the 5K by being very aggressive and racing intelligently, but without concern for &quot;dying&quot; in the race.&nbsp; Similar to Mah, she established a solid pace and moved up as the field fell off, running 5:53 for the first 1600 and 5:51 for the second 1600.&nbsp; Also similar to Mah, she fell off a lot even though she never lost focus, racing the entire way.&nbsp; Her final 1600 was 5:59, closing with&nbsp;a very tired 47 for an 18:30.55.</p>
            <p align="left">Matthew Kearney '22 continued to show no fear when racing.&nbsp; In the fast section of the Mile, he, Aidan Gilson '19 and Kent&nbsp;Slaney '21 all were racing to make the fast section of the Mile in the New England Division III Championship in three weeks, and possibly the NCAA Division III Championship in five weeks.&nbsp; The pacer took the pack out fast, but Gilson had a poor start and got pushed back.&nbsp; Regardless, at the 200 mark he was in fourth place in a solid position.&nbsp; At the 400 Gilson was at 62.0, Kearney at 62.1 and Slaney at 62.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second 400 was status quo for all three although the pace slowed slightly with all three between 2:05.7 and 2:06.4.&nbsp; However, in the third quarter Kearney was aggressive, moving up to 3:11 while both Gilson and Slaney started thinking about themselves, losing the focus and falling back to 3:14.&nbsp; Kearney fell off from fatigue due to an overall lack of fitness and speed due to his time out with injury, but still ran 4:19.56.&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">Similarly, Margaret Trautner '20 an outstanding middle-distance runner, already qualified for the NCAA DIII Championship in the 800, wanted to race the Mile.&nbsp; Although she knows there is no pace that could be thrown at her by anyone in the meet that she could not handle, after a 72 first 400, she disengaged completely.&nbsp; She ran a solid 5:10.30 for second place, but did not take advantage of a great opportunity to run a national level time in the Mile.</p>
            <p align="left">In a series of poor strategic moves, or a total lack of strategy, a few MIT athletes took the lead from the start at an unrealistic pace, setting themselves up for failure.&nbsp; This certainly indicated poor coaching at the very least.&nbsp; Nick Duchatellier '22 was hoping for fast 600 so he could make the NED3 fast section, but going out in 24.8 pretty much ended that dream.&nbsp; The freshman still held on reasonably well, although his final 400 in 61.3 had to hurt.&nbsp; Then in the 800 Ellery Rajagopal '21 did the same thing, going out in 27.8, far into the lead of his section.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he finished in an indoor personal best of 1:59.06 for third place in his section, one has to wander what he could have run had he paced a little slower.&nbsp; Finally Simon Alford '20, a very experienced runner&nbsp;and defending NED3 champion in the 1000, was out too fast around the first turn when his coach hollered not to lead.&nbsp; Alford thought he was told to lead so continued the pace he was on, coming through the 200 in 29.3&nbsp;and the 400 in 58.9.&nbsp; As expected the pain hit early and the junior fell back to 2:36.40.</p>
            <p align="left">In positive races, Bailey Tregoning '19 and Marissa McPhillips '20 dominated their respective races. &nbsp;Tregoning paced out to a 31.6 first 200 of her 600 race, taking a sizable lead en route to a 1:38.22 victory.&nbsp; McPhillips paced out a 35.2 initial 200 for her 1000 meter race.&nbsp; She only deviated slightly as she came through the 800 in 2:21.4 on the way to her 2:58.15 victory.</p>
            <p align="left">Also on the track, Benton Wilson '21 blazed his way to a meet record in the 200 with a 22.21 gun to finish victory.&nbsp; This was a very fast time on a flat track, converting to a 21.82 banked track time, ranking him 10th in&nbsp;NCAA DIII.</p>
            <p align="left">In the field events, Will Woltmann '22 had a big day, throwing personal bests in both the Shot Put and Weight Throw.&nbsp; In the Shot, Woltmann won the event with a 49-5 1/2 throw, good for eighth on the all-time MIT list.&nbsp; Supporting him, his teammates placed third, fourth, fifth and seventh.&nbsp; In fourth, Albert Menio '20 threw an excellent PR of 44-0 1/2.&nbsp; In the women's Shot Put, Lily Papalia '22 threw a season best 35-8 3/4&nbsp;for fourth place.</p>
            <p align="left"> In the Weight Throw, Woltmann threw a best of 47-9 1/4, good for fifth place.&nbsp; Jon Fakkema '19 placed second with a throw of 55-2 3/4&nbsp;and Menio placed fourth.</p>
            <p align="left">Scott Cameron '19 was back to his winning ways, taking the Pole Vault in a season best 14-11.&nbsp; Emily Caragay '22 cleared a season best 10-11 3/4.</p>
            <p align="left">Lucy Lee '21 won the Triple Jump with a jump&nbsp;of 36-5 as the MIT women ruled the event, placing 1-2-3.</p>
            <p align="left">Next week, MIT will send their faster oval runners to the Boston University David Hemery Valentine's Classic, leave most of their field event athletes to their own Gordon Kelly Invitational, and give quite a few the weekend off from competing.&nbsp; The Engineers hope to put their act together in time to position themselves&nbsp;for a chance to win another NED3 title.            </p>
