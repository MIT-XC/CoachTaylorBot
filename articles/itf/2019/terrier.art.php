            <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold">Track &amp; Field Teams Step Up to the Level of Competition at BU Terrier Classic</span></p>
            <p align="left">January 25-26, 2019</p>
            <p align="left">For the first time this season, the Men's and Women's Track &amp; Field teams were in a non-scoring competition, so had the opportunity to focus on a single primary event with outstanding competition.&nbsp; Most did not waste this opportunity.</p>
            <p align="left">Most of the higher profile oval runners were competing at the <a href="terrier.res.php">Boston University John Thomas Terrier Classic</a>; the women on Friday and the men on Saturday.&nbsp; Those athletes performed very well.&nbsp; Most of the field event athletes and everyone else were competing at the <a href="smith-king.res.php">Tufts University Branwen Smith-King Invitational</a>&nbsp;where the results were not quite so solid.</p>
            <p align="left">At BU on Friday the women from MIT took advantage of what is arguably the fastest indoor track in the world.&nbsp; First up for MIT was the 800.&nbsp; Bailey Tregoning '19 had a great first lap until she slowed at the end of the second turn&nbsp;so she would be further in the back of the pack.&nbsp; This adjustment cost her a second or two as she had to make up that ground later.&nbsp; Regardless, the senior raced well, moving into second with&nbsp;200 to go. She was unable to hold that position, finishing sixth in 2:13.84, a time good for #6 in the country for DIII.&nbsp; Margaret Trautner '20 was in the next section.&nbsp; She also got out well, running 31.2 even though she was in the back of the field.&nbsp; After a 64.4 400 she moved up to the lead pack of four.&nbsp; As she prepared to go around them they kicked it in and one more passed her although she ran an indoor PR of 2:12.89, currently #4 in the country for DIII.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 1000, Kira Buttrey '22 had the misfortune of being in a section that did not go out fast&nbsp;- 71 at the 400.&nbsp; Buttrey took the lead at this point, but was unable to stay relaxed in doing so.&nbsp; The net result was she used a lot of energy unnecessarily and got passed at the end.&nbsp; Her final time of 2:59.22 was one tenth slower than she ran earlier this season on a flat track.</p>
            <p align="left">Marissa McPhillips '20 was up for her first serious Mile Run of the season.&nbsp; Her section went out fast, perhaps a little too fast for McPhillips this early in the season.&nbsp; Her first quarter of 73 and half at 2:26 were certainly quick even though she was in the middle of the pack.&nbsp; The junior continued to compete well, only slowing slightly as she finished in 4:57.64, good for #7 in the country.&nbsp; Tessa Weiss '20 hoped to capitalize on her excellent 3K from last week, but once the pack settled she put herself right in the back instead of seizing the opportunity to be up front.&nbsp; Her initial 400 of 75 was perfect, but she failed to move up with the pack, hitting the 880 in 2:34 and the 1320 in 3:54.&nbsp; Her finish of 5:13.16 is not reflective of her ability, but a step in the right direction.</p>
            <p align="left">The only two field event athletes representing MIT were both in the Pole Vault.&nbsp; Jacqueline Ahrens '21 is getting accustomed to moving up to bigger poles, and when she gets there the rest of Division III may be in trouble.&nbsp; She cleared 11-11 3/4 (#12 in the country) for a season best and teammate, Kari Stromhaug&nbsp;'19, who cleared 12-1 1/2 (#7 in the country) earlier this season, cleared 11-5 3/4, just missing 11-11 3/4.&nbsp; Both are All Americans from last year and should be there again this year.</p>
            <p align="left">At the end of the evening it was time for the distance events.&nbsp; First up for MIT in the 3K was Jenna Melanson '20.&nbsp; It would be the Steeplechase All American's first 3K of the season.&nbsp; Seeded in the back of the second fastest section (fastest section was won in 9:12), Melanson was hoping for 80 second 400's.&nbsp; Although she was in the back of the pack the first quarter pace was 78.&nbsp; Racing instead of focusing on splits, the junior moved up when necessary, hitting the 1600 in 5:16.&nbsp; Continuing to move up in the field as the only Division III runner in the race, she continued hitting 79's until the final 200.&nbsp; Her overall time was a huge personal best of 9:54.10, #6 in the country at this time.&nbsp; Einat Gavish '22 was in the next section.&nbsp; She got out a little too fast (79 for the 400, but ran very relaxed nonetheless.&nbsp; After 1200 meters something changed and the freshman disengaged a&nbsp;bit, slowing first to 85 pace and then 88 and finally 94, finishing at 10:41.60</p>
            <p align="left">Saving the best for last, the final competitor for MIT was Katie Collins '21 in the 5K.&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal was to run 5:30 pace and race.&nbsp; She could not have executed the plan much better.&nbsp; She clicked off 41 second laps to a 5:29 first 1600, moving up in the field with an amazing feel for timing.&nbsp; She slowed to 83 second 400's in the second mile despite taking the lead, coming through the 3200 in 11:02.&nbsp; Collins continued to pull away from the field until one runner closed hard and made an effort to steal the victory.&nbsp; Collins closed with&nbsp;a 40 final 200 for the victory and an impressive personal best of 17:19.41, currently ranked #8 in the country.</p>
            <p align="left">Day two at BU, the men's day, started with the 800 again for MIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon Alford '20, still getting his fitness back in his third week back after injury, ran a very smart race.&nbsp; He did not allow the early pace to pull him out, instead sitting in the back in 27.8 for the first 200.&nbsp; He gradually moved up in the field with splits of 56.2 and 1:24.8.&nbsp; On the final backstretch the junior waited a little late to start his kick, passing a few, but getting hung out in lane two or three on the final turn.&nbsp; He closed well anyway, finishing in 1:54.28, #12 in the country.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 400 Benton Wilson '21, also just returning from injury, was looking forward to his first 400 of the season.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilson did not disappoint, taking the lead going into the break with a high 22 first lap.&nbsp; He held it through the finish where the strong first lap hurt him a bit, but still finished in a personal best 49.16, #9 in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilson returned in the 200 a little later in the meet, running a season best 22.06, #14 in the country.</p>
            <p align="left">Nick Duchatellier '22&nbsp;raced the 500 for the first time.&nbsp; This is largely a Division I event, so never competed at any Division III meets in New England.&nbsp; Duchatellier got out really fast in 23.9, splitting the 400 in 51.&nbsp; His final 100 was a struggle, but a strong time of 1:06.41 for his first time running the event.</p>
            <p align="left">Kent Slaney '21 had a nice breakthrough in the Mile Run.&nbsp; The only mistake was that he went to the front of the field after the one turn break, bringing him through 30.3 for the 200.&nbsp; Once he settled in in third position, the pace slowed&nbsp;to 62 at the quarter and 2:08 at the half.&nbsp; A small group separated from the field and Slaney was with them at 3:12 for 1200 meters.&nbsp; Slaney took the lead and came very close to holding it, losing the race in the final 50 meters, but still running a personal best of 4:16.36.</p>
            <p align="left">The only field entry for MIT was national runner-up Yorai Shaoul '21 in the Triple Jump.&nbsp; Going against his first real competition of the year, Shaoul hoped to use the competition to his advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he competed well, Shaoul had trouble getting the feel of the flexible wooden runway.&nbsp; Although he made the finals&nbsp;and jumped a season best of 48-5 1/4, it was not what he wanted, but still the best mark in the country for DIII.</p>
            <p align="left">The final event for Tech was the men's 3K.&nbsp; Josh Rosenkranz '19 and Aidan Gilson '19 were in a section together.&nbsp; Rosenkranz was fresh off his amazing 14:38.70 (#5 in the country) flat track 5K from last week, and Gilson was getting over an upper respiratory illness - hardly the best scenario for a head to head match.&nbsp; The pace was pretty perfect as the pack hit a 66&nbsp;leadoff 400, slowed just&nbsp;a bit to come through the 1600 in 4:30.&nbsp; At this point Rosenkranz moved towards the front and Gilson started to fall back.&nbsp; Rosenkranz took the lead, running 66 pace for the final 1000 and finishing in 8:23.35, #8 in the country.&nbsp; Gilson briefly disengaged, but then responded and held on for an 8:35.33.&nbsp; In the next section was freshman Matthew Kearney.&nbsp; The rookie had a fever yesterday and had decided not to race.&nbsp; He felt much better this morning, had no fever, and wanted to race - miracles do happen.&nbsp; Not only did the freshman race, but he raced extremely well.&nbsp; He locked onto the chase pack and matched them step for step.&nbsp; The 1600 split was 4:31.&nbsp; After the 2K the pace picked up.&nbsp; Kearney fell off slightly but increased his pace to finish in an MIT freshman record 8:28.13, #18 in the country.</p>
            <p align="left">Over at Tufts, there&nbsp;were some outstanding performances, but not many.&nbsp; It seems most of the Engineers failed to compete at the expected level.</p>
            <p align="left">Perhaps the top performance was turned in by Alec Reduker '20 who won the High Jump at 6-9.&nbsp; Reduker actually won the event at 6-2 3/4, which took him three attempts.&nbsp; He then cleared the next two heights before missing at 6-9 1/2.</p>
            <p align="left">Ryan Nall&nbsp;'22 threw a personal best in the Weight Throw with a toss of 49-9 3/4 to finish behind teammate Jon Fakkema '19 at 55-4 1/4.&nbsp; Staying with the throws, Will Woltmann '22 threw 49-2 1/4 for a season best in the Shot Put.&nbsp; This is truly an impressive freshman throwing class for teh Engineers.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">The remaining positive performance for the men was Josh Derrick's 5K victory in 15:35.04.</p>
            <p align="left">The women performed better than the men as a whole.&nbsp; In the Pole Vault, Anais Marenco '22 made a breakthrough to clear 11-9 3/4, #15 in the country.&nbsp; Teammate Lila Wine '21 cleared 11-5 3/4 for a personal best.</p>
            <p align="left">Continuing with the jumps, Margaret Redfield '21 matched her personal best of 5-4 1/2 in the High Jump, good for 15th in the country.&nbsp; In the Triple Jump, Lucy Lee '21, who had earlier run a season best 9.68 in the 60HH, won with a personal best 36-8 1/2, #19 in the country.&nbsp; Elena Andree '22 also jumped a personal best of 36-1 1/2.&nbsp; Although none of the women jumped a PR&nbsp;in the Long Jump, they all jumped well.</p>
            <p align="left">Season bests were earned by Darby LaPlant '19 in the 5K with a 19:11.56, Skylar Brooks '20 in the 800 with a 2:23.22 and by Kristen Frombach '19, running 62.84 in the 400.</p>
            <p align="left">Next week MIT will send a few field event&nbsp;athletes to the NEICAAA Championship - a poorly attended New England Championship across all three divisions&nbsp;- at the Reggie Lewis Center, and the remainder of those competing will be at the Tufts Cupid Challenge.            </p>
