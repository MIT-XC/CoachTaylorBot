            <h2 style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 16px">Two More Elite 90 Winners, 15 All Americans Add to MIT Legacy</span></h2>
            <p style="font-size: 12px">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">March 8-9, 2019</p>
            <p align="left">This was not the best team MIT Track &amp; Field has ever sent to the <a href="ncaa.res.pdf">NCAA Division III Indoor Championship</a>, but it certainly was close, and among those that represented the program well with the number of events represented and the effort given at the championship.&nbsp; At the end of the two days, the men finished with 22 points, good for&nbsp;seventh&nbsp;place&nbsp;and seven All Americans.&nbsp; The women completed the championship with eight All Americans and 15 points, tying for 11th place overall.</p>
            <p align="left">The championship week began with the awards presented to the regional athletes of the season and the Elite 90 awards, which are given to the individual female and male at that championship with the highest GPA.&nbsp; If there is a tie it goes to the one with the most academic units.&nbsp; Despite the fact that MIT student-athletes do not receive the credits for their first semester in their freshman year due to the Pass/No Record status, the MIT Track &amp; Field / Cross Country program has&nbsp;had nine previous Elite 90 winners, by far more than any other program in the country.&nbsp; Margaret Trautner '20 and Josh Rosenkranz '19 added to that total, both winning the award for the first time, marking the third time the program had both the male and female winner at the same championship.&nbsp; Yorai Shaoul '21 was awarded the Male Field Athlete of the Year for his amazing performances in the horizontal jumps.</p>
            <p align="left">The championship itself began for MIT with the Men's Pole Vault.&nbsp; Liam Ackerman '21 entered the championship as the ninth seed.&nbsp; After struggling at 15-1, needing three attempts to clear the bar, Ackerman looked great.&nbsp; He cleared 15-7 on his first attempt and then 15-11 on his second attempt.&nbsp; At 16-0 3/4 and 16-2 3/4 he cleared on his first attempt, even though both were personal bests.&nbsp; He was unable to clear&nbsp;16-4 3/4, which earned him fourth place for MIT.</p>
            <p align="left">In the High Jump, Alec Reduker&nbsp;'20 cleared 6-6 3/4 on his first attempt, but just did not have it at 6-8, placing him 10th out of the 20 jumpers.</p>
            <p align="left">In the running events, Aidan Gilson '19 was attempting the difficult potential triple of Mile trials, DMR anchor, Mile finals if he made it that far.&nbsp; Day one had the Mile trials and the DMR.&nbsp; In the trials, often a strategic race, it was a solid pace up front as Gilson was in second place through splits of 64, 2:07 and 3:10.&nbsp; When the pace picked up, Gilson, running in the second heat, knew what he needed to run and managed that with a 4:11.22 to slide into the finals.</p>
            <p align="left">Benton Wilson&nbsp;'21 was the 15th seed entering the 200.&nbsp; This race is often decided by the lane received on a random basis.&nbsp; Only lanes 3,&nbsp;4, 5&nbsp;and 6 are used, because the further out a runner is the less curve and less forces the runner has to deal with.&nbsp; Blessed all year with receiving lanes five or six, Wilson was given lane three this time.&nbsp; Despite the lane, Wilson ran an excellent 22.03&nbsp;for 12th overall, missing finals by exactly 1/10th of a second.</p>
            <p align="left">Josh Rosenkranz '19, racing the 5K, had been struggling with an aggravated achilles for much of the season, limiting his mileage and workouts.&nbsp; Not able to do workouts the past two weeks, not much was expected of the senior, but he gave his best effort.&nbsp; Through 3200 meters at 9:24, Rosenkranz was with the leaders and looking solid, but then his achilles and lack of fitness both showed.&nbsp; To try and save his upcoming outdoor season he made the decision to not finish the race.</p>
            <p align="left">In the final race of the evening, the  DMR quartet was hoping for a great race.&nbsp; Simon Alford '20 led off with the 1200 leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alford started out great with&nbsp;excellent position in 30.2&nbsp;for the first 200.&nbsp; The pace slowed and Alford allowed many to pass him, putting him at 2:04.8 at the 800 mark.&nbsp; He then accelerated hard on the backstretch, taking the lead with 200 to go, but was unable to hold it, falling off considerably as he handed off at 3:06.7 in ninth place.&nbsp; Wilson took the baton and made up a lot of ground, moving the team up to sixth&nbsp;with his 49.3 400 leg.&nbsp; Aiden Foucault-Etheridge '22 ran a flawless race, moving up consistently with a 400 split of 55.5 and a final time of 1:53.9 to edge into third place.&nbsp; Gilson took the baton and despite a 61.5 first 400 he fell back.&nbsp; His 2:06.5 had him back to sixth place and his 3:15.2 put him back in ninth, one place out of All American status.&nbsp; The senior dug down and found a little something extra for his teammates, dropping a 59.3 to move his team to sixth place with a 4:14.9 and 10:04.82 overall time.</p>
            <p align="left">The women's first day began with Jenna Melanson '20 in the 3K.&nbsp; When the NCAA went to 20 athletes per event at the National Championship, this forced the 3K to go from a final only on Saturday to trials and finals on Friday/Saturday due to the rule that dictate how many runners can be in a one section final.&nbsp; This significantly changed the landscape of those who had raced the 5K/3K double in the past.&nbsp; Melanson, a solid seed, fell into the trap of taking the trials lightly, which means she had little to no adrenaline helping her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her heat ran a solid pace of 40 seconds per 200 throughout the race, which was faster than the first section.&nbsp; With the top four in each heat and the next four fastest times making the final, Melanson knew she would have to run faster than 10:00 and place among the top eight in her heat to make that happen.&nbsp; She finished well enough to advance with a 9:59.96, avoiding the trap of not being excited enough about the trials to race well.</p>
            <p align="left">Marissa McPhillips '20 was attempting the same triple as Gilson.&nbsp; Having done this same triple last year, McPhillips knew she was fully capable of handling the load.&nbsp; In the trials, she was in a section that was very strategic, running a pedestrian 2:39&nbsp;for the first half.&nbsp; Running much of her race in lanes two and three so she would be in position to respond&nbsp;to a strong breakaway move. The pace never picked up, so McPhillips knew she would have to place among the top three to make it into the final.&nbsp; The pace picked up right after the half but was still relatively slow overall.&nbsp; McPhillips ran the second half in 2:22 to advance with a time of 5:01.79.</p>
            <p align="left">MIT had two representatives in the 800, Bailey Tregoning '19 and Margaret Trautner '20.&nbsp; Trautner was up first.&nbsp;&nbsp;With three sections, the top two in each section and the next two fastest would advance to an eight person final.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a slow first 600 of 1:42.8, Trautner moved into the lead.&nbsp; With a 100 meters remaining she was passed, falling to third.&nbsp; With&nbsp;her heat being slow, she knew she would have to be one of the top two in her heat.&nbsp; She tried to move past, but interfered with another runner in her attempt, tripping herself and getting disqualified in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tregoning was up next&nbsp;in the second of three heats.&nbsp; Her heat went out hot as she came through solid splits of 31, 64 and 1:38.&nbsp; She fell off some as she closed, but held on enough for fourth in 2:13.54.&nbsp; Since the first section was slow, she could still get in as one of the two fastest if the third heat was also slow.&nbsp; Sure enough, despite knowing&nbsp;what it would take the heat was slow, allowing Tregoning to make to the final on Saturday.</p>
            <p align="left">The women's Pole Vault was next and MIT had three entrants in the event.&nbsp; Anais Marenco '22 was not able to clear the opening height of 11-3 3/4 despite having cleared 12-2 1/2 the previous week.&nbsp; Jacqueline Ahrens '21, having a 12-2 mark to her credit, cleared 11-3 3/4, but that was it.&nbsp; However, Kari Stromhaug '19 continued to make height after height, often clipping the bar, but not displacing it.&nbsp; Her best this season had been 12-5 1/2.&nbsp; She cleared that on her first attempt, needed two to clear 12-7 1/2 and then cleared 12-9 1/2 on her first attempt.&nbsp; This earned her third place as the top two cleared 12-11 1/2.</p>
            <p align="left">Back to the track for the 5K and Katie Collins '21, a sophomore with freshman eligibility.&nbsp; Collins has been on a mercurial line of improvement this year and was seeded fifth based on her 16:53 performance two weeks ago.&nbsp; However, with her relatively low mileage and the recovery needed from her 5K/3K double two weeks before, how she would respond would be of interest.&nbsp; The leaders went out ridiculously fast, coming through 1600 meters in 5:13.&nbsp; Collins went out in a reasonable 5:22 and was in 13th place.&nbsp; She started passing people in the second 1600, but was also slowing down more than she should have, running 5:29.&nbsp; She was now in 11th place, but was starting to fade.&nbsp; She passed two more and was passed by one to end up in 10th in 17:13.87, a very respectable time.</p>
            <p align="left">The final event for the women on day one was the DMR.&nbsp; McPhillips, Trautner and Tregoning were all coming back from hard races with Trautner suffering a pretty nasty fall when she tripped. Only 400 leg, Sarah Ishamuddin '21 was fresh.&nbsp; Trautner ran well early on, but steadily slowed as the 1200 leg went on.&nbsp; She came through the 1000 in 3:00, took the lead briefly with 150 to go, but then faded, significantly falling back to seventh at the handoff.&nbsp; Ishamuddin got out well with a leadoff 28.0, but was unable to capitalize, finishing in 61.2 as the team dropped to 10th.&nbsp; Tregoning ran the race of her life, running a smart, well paced race to move the team up to fourth with her 2:12.1 leg.&nbsp; McPhillips moved up quickly with a 71 first 400 to pull up with the leaders, who went out slow right from the start.&nbsp; After a 78 second 400, nearly the entire field had closed&nbsp;the gap.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace picked up a bit in the third 400 and then opened up big in the final 400.&nbsp; McPhillips closed well, finishing in 4:55.5, good for sixth place overall in 11:47.13.</p>
            <p align="left">Saturday began with the Triple Jump.&nbsp; Yorai Shaoul '21, national runner-up last year, both indoors and outdoors, was the number two seed coming into the championship.&nbsp; That was laid to rest on his first attempt, a 49-11 1/4 bomb, and season best, that no one ever came close to.&nbsp; Shaoul's 10 points moved MIT up to 18 points.</p>
            <p align="left">While the Triple Jump was in progress, the Mile final was taking place.&nbsp; The race could not have been more perfectly set up for Gilson.&nbsp; Very similar to the trials, the casual pace of 64, 2:08, 3:10, allowed Gilson to feel comfortable at the mid-point and be in position to unleash his lethal kick.&nbsp; He dropped a 59 to take fifth place in 4:09.69.&nbsp; The men's scoring was over, but 22 points was an impressive total.</p>
            <p align="left">McPhillips was up first for the women on day two.&nbsp; The Mile pace was quick&nbsp;up front, but McPhillips was in the back of the chase pack for the first quarter, but gradually moved up as the race progressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of the last quarter she was moving up on fifth place when they started kicking.&nbsp; McPhillips final 400 in 73 was not enough as two she had passed, passed her back, dropping her to eighth in 4:55.52, but giving her yet another All America honor and her team one more point.</p>
            <p align="left">The 800 was Tech's next event&nbsp;and Tregoning was MIT's representative.&nbsp; The senior was in her first individual NCAA final and was not going to let it go to waste.&nbsp; When she saw the first 200 in 32 she knew the pace was perfect for her even though she was in the back of the pack.&nbsp; After the 400 in 66.0, she moved into seventh place.&nbsp; In the&nbsp;final lap she moved into sixth with 150 to go and into fifth with 50 to go, finishing in 2:12.73 for fifth place and her first individual All America&nbsp;award.&nbsp; Tregoning's four points gave the Engineers 14 points.</p>
            <p align="left">The final event for MIT was the 3K starring Jenna Melanson.&nbsp;&nbsp;The junior raced with confidence despite her trials experience.&nbsp; The pace was casual, about 40 seconds per lap as Melanson positioned herself in fifth for much of the early part of the race.&nbsp; As she passed the 1600 in 5:21, Melanson picked up the pace as the top eight separated themselves from the rest of the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her move caused the entire lead group to speed up to a 78 and then 77 quarters as she moved up to fourth and came up to run beside third place.&nbsp; With three laps to go Melanson was not able to match the speed of the leaders&nbsp;as she began to slow.&nbsp;&nbsp;She fell to eighth with 300 meters to go, but held onto that place, still able to close with a 39 for a 9:54.83.&nbsp; Her single point gave her team 15.</p>
            <p align="left">It has been a very successful season for the Engineers.&nbsp; The next meet will see a few distance runners at the Bridgewater State Invitational&nbsp;if weather permits on March 21 and then March 28 for the technical athletes in California at the UCSD Collegiate Open.&nbsp; The first full team meet will be at home on April 6 versus Bates, RPI and Tufts.</p>
