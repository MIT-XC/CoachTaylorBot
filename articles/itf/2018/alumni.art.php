            <p align="left">December 16, 2017</p>
            <p align="left">62 MIT Track &amp; Field Alums (affectionately called Has-Beens) showed up to compete and support in an effort to take down as many of the current varsity team as possible in the annual <a href="alumni.res.pdf">Alumni/ae Track &amp; Field meet</a>.&nbsp; On the men's side the alumni had the entries necessary to pull off the upset, but that would require near perfection.&nbsp; For the alumnae&nbsp;there simply were not enough entries outside the throws, jumps, pole vault and the Mile.&nbsp; To aid the alums, the varsity were without all cross country runners who had participated at the Regional and National&nbsp;Championships&nbsp;as they needed some down&nbsp;time.</p>
            <p align="left">Moving the Alumni/ae Meet back to before the holidays, where it had been until 2004 when it was moved to the second weekend in January, seems to be better for Has-Been attendance.&nbsp; Of course the added caveat of not having to race the national level middle-distance and distance runners should make this date more attractive&nbsp;as well.</p>
            <p align="left">The alumni knew they would have to do some damage in the field events if they were going to have a chance at the upset.&nbsp; The Long Jump, High Jump and Weight Throw were the first events&nbsp;and would dictate how much of a shot the alumni might have.&nbsp; Arinze Okeke '17, competing in every field event, was the main source of point potential in the Long Jump.&nbsp; After round one, Okeke was in second place as only Yorai Shaoul '21 was ahead.&nbsp; After round two, Joa Kennedy '21 surpassed Okeke and in round three, Mac Gregg '21 moved ahead.&nbsp; Okeke improved his mark on his final jump to 20-3 3/4, but he finished out of the scoring&nbsp;in fourth place.&nbsp; Gregg jumped an impressive 22-10 and Shaoul was not far behind at 22-0 1/4.</p>
            <p align="left">Marios Michalakis '04, the freshman record holder in the Hammer Throw (175-3) was the best hope for points in the Weight Throw, but he had not thrown much since he graduated.&nbsp; Jon Fakkema '19 threw a personal best 53-0 1/2 to win the event.&nbsp; Cody Bratten '18, picking up the Weight again after not having thrown it for two years due to back problems, took second with Albert Menio '20 claiming third.&nbsp; Okeke again took fourth, edging out Michalakis.</p>
            <p align="left">The High Jump had the potential for the alumni, but age and gravity tend to take a toll on the Has-Beens.&nbsp; Jordan Mizerak '14 looked outstanding in clearing 6-0 but he had two misses at that height&nbsp;and was unable to clear 6-2.&nbsp; Alec Reduker '20 cleared 6-4 on his first attempt to win with Chris Washington '20 claiming second, also clearing 6-4, but needing two attempts to do so.&nbsp; Also competing for the alumni was Matt Falk '12.</p>
            <p align="left">With three sweeps by the Varsity, it was apparent the upset was not going to happen, but that did not stop the alumni from competing very well.</p>
            <p align="left">On the track, Matt Deyo '16 gave a lesson on how to spend as little energy as possible and still own the event.&nbsp; After hanging back in the early stages of the slow race (2:16 at the 800), Deyo moved up towards the front.&nbsp; He shot to the lead with 550 meters remaining with Kent Slaney '21 going with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a 64 third 400 by Deyo, Slaney took over with 150 meters to go.&nbsp; His mistake was that he thought he put Deyo away and did not give it everything he had.&nbsp; Deyo mounted a final attack with 50 to go and shot past Slaney for the win in 4:23.45 to 4:23.65.&nbsp; Logan Trimble '13 took advantage of early leader, Nate Foss '20, giving up and coasting at the end, passing him for third in 4:33.47.</p>
            <p align="left">In the next race, the 60HH, there had reportedly been a fair amount of trash talking by Michael Kaba&nbsp;'16 to Chris Sweeney '18 leading up to the race.&nbsp; Joining the fray for the Alumni were Adrian Samsel '16 and Mizerak.&nbsp; Sweeney let his race do the talking, winning in 8.54 to 8.83 for Kaba.&nbsp; Kennedy added another third to his long jump finish, running 8.86.</p>
            <p align="left">The 400 offered another really close finish.&nbsp; This time the Varsity won the event.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyndale Hannan '20 ran 52.87 to beat Nick Diamantoni '15 by .01 for the win.&nbsp; Diamantoni had come from behind to nearly pull out the victory.&nbsp; Ken Acquah '20 ran 53.05 take third over Derek Barnes '16.</p>
            <p align="left">The varsity continued to bring out the youth with freshmen Benton Wilson and Larry Qiu in the 60 Meter Dash.&nbsp; Wilson won in 7.21 and Qiu was close behind in 7.26.&nbsp; Tyler Singer-Clark '14 was third in 7.35.&nbsp; Also racing for the Alums was Kaba (7.56), Kyle Hannon '13 (7.66) and Bob Williamson '59 (10.11), the most elder competitor in the meet, and doing so at an extremely high level for his age.</p>
            <p align="left">The 800 brought another opportunity where the experience of the alumni was worth more than talent and youth of the varsity.&nbsp; Simon Alford '20 took the pace out hard, splitting 55 for the first 400.&nbsp; Sam Parker '15, who won this event last year, was biding his time back in 57.&nbsp; When your open 400 on a facility is at best a 52, going out in 55 on that same facility is probably not the best idea.&nbsp; A relaxed 56 would have made a huge difference.&nbsp; Nathan Munet '19 pulled into the lead going through the 600 mark, splitting 1:24 while Parker was still back in 1:26.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker passed Alford with 100 to go, and made up 15 meters on Munet in the final 100 to win going away in 1:56.14.&nbsp; Munet ran an outstanding time in 1:56.62 while Alford was third in 1:59.30.&nbsp; Also competing for the alums was Marc Light '88, running 2:31.28.</p>
            <p align="left">The Varsity returned to dominance in the 200, placing 1-2 with Sweeney taking first in 23.25 and Ryan Prinster&nbsp;'18 claiming second in 23.39.&nbsp; Danny Newman '17 took third for the Has-Beens in 23.67.&nbsp; Singer-Clarke ran 23.91, Hannon 24.69, Henry Tareque '17 24.91 and Williamson running an amazing 38.35.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 5K, the wiser, more experienced alumni again taught the Varsity runners a lesson in racing.&nbsp; Ben Freed '18 went out at a pace that would net him a New England Division III Championship qualifying performance of 15:30.&nbsp; Deyo&nbsp;and Justin Bullock '14 were more interested in the win than a time and sat back about three seconds letting Freed do all the work.&nbsp; Freed's teammates were not interested in helping him out either, running 5:01 at the 1600 to Freed's 4:56.&nbsp; At the 3200&nbsp;Freed was at 9:58, still on pace, but the alums were closing and about to take the lead.&nbsp; Once they moved into the lead Freed was unable to respond.&nbsp; Deyo pulled away for his second victory, winning in 15:23.42.&nbsp; Bullock took second in 15:25.84.&nbsp; Freed claimed third in 15:38.10.&nbsp; Others racing for the alums were Fivos Constantinou '06 in 15:56.24, Benji Xie '15 15:59.22, Roy Wedge '14 16:10.62, Matt Jordan '15 16:13.37, Rory Beyer '17 16:38.76 and Brian Gilligan '17 16:49.36.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 4x200 Relay, Wilson, Gregg, Qiu and Washington raced for the victory in 1:33.49.&nbsp; The alums, represented by Barnes, Parker, Samsel and Diamantoni ran 1:34.27.</p>
            <p align="left">Back to the field events, Billy Ruschel '18 won the Triple Jump with a leap of 48-0.&nbsp;&nbsp;His final jump was well over 49', but a foul nevertheless.&nbsp; Okeke pulled out a second with a 44-7 1/2 jump, edging out Prinster at 44-7.</p>
            <p align="left">The Shot Put was another sweep by the varsity, in the same order as the Weight Throw.&nbsp; Fakkema won in 42-11 1/4, Bratten was second in 40-4 1/2 and Menio third at 37-10 1/2.&nbsp; Okeke again claimed fourth with a throw of 37-0.</p>
            <p align="left">The final event, the Pole Vault, was an excellent competition.&nbsp; Eight alumni participated, but were not quite able to crack into the top three.&nbsp; Scott Cameron '19 won with an impressive vault of 15-5 from a short approach.&nbsp; Bobby Upton '20 was second at 13-11 1/4 and Raja Rajcic '20 was third with the same height.&nbsp; Dan Kwon '02 was impressive, clearing 13-5 1/4, as was Marshall Wentworth '16, also clearing 13-5 1/4.&nbsp; Nate Sharpe '09, a volunteer assistant for the varsity, cleared 12-11 1/2, as did&nbsp;Mizerak.&nbsp; Okeke, showing his versatility, cleared 10-11 3/4.&nbsp; Ben Schreck '15 and Patrick Barragan '08, the varsity Pole Vault coach, both no-heighted.</p>
            <p align="left">The final score was Varsity 92, Alumni 30.</p>
            <p align="left">The women's meet, predicted to be a runaway by the varsity, was much less so than the men with the final score varsity 78, alumnae 33.</p>
            <p align="left">One of meet highlights was the return of Cimmy Virdi '16 (also a volunteer assistant for the varsity) to Pole Vault competition.&nbsp; The four time national champion cleared 12-5 1/2 for an easy victory.&nbsp;  Jacqueline Ahrens '21 earned second place with a vault of 11-5 3/4.&nbsp; Makenzie Patarino '19 took third, also clearing 11-5 3/4.&nbsp; Demonstrating impressive depth, Kari Stromhaug '19, also cleared 11-5 3/4 but did not score.&nbsp; Jen Tylock '17 did not place, but cleared 10-11 3/4.&nbsp; Also competing for the alumnae were Leah Schmitz '16, Emily Cole '09, Joanna Chen '15 and Caroline Figgatt '11.</p>
            <p align="left">Natalie Alper '17, a volunteer assistant for the varsity, won the High Jump at 5-3 3/4 and had an impressive attempt at 5-5 3/4.&nbsp; Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 took second place honors, also clearing 5-3 3/4.&nbsp; Also competing for the alumnae were Veronica Szklarzewski '15 and Julia Sharpe '09. Kailyn Bryk '21 took third for the varsity at 4-7 3/4.</p>
            <p align="left">Alper also scored in the Long Jump, taking third&nbsp;in 15-10 1/2, pulling out third place on her sixth and final jump.&nbsp; Haley Strouf '18 won easily in 17-8 and Jasmine Jin '20 took second in 16-10 1/2.</p>
            <p align="left">The alums scored big points in the throws.&nbsp; Ariela Slutsky '18 won both the Weight Throw and the Shot Put, taking the Weight with a throw of 55-1 3/4 and the Shot Put with a toss of 38-6 1/2 as she converts from the glide to the spin.&nbsp; Jackie Vahey '17 earned second in both events for the Has-Beens, throwing 46-2 1/2 and 38-1 respectively.&nbsp; Ellen Liverpool '15 placed third in the Weight Throw at 45-0 1/2 and Ashley Wheeler '15 took third in the Shot Put at 30-9 1/4.</p>
            <p align="left">The varsity swept the final field event, the Triple Jump.&nbsp; Jin claimed first place honors at 37-3 3/4. Elizabeth Weeks '21 took second at 35-3 1/4 and Lucy Lee '21 was third with&nbsp;a jump of 35-0 1/2.</p>
            <p align="left">On the track, Louise van den Heuvel '14 and Christina Wicker '17 schooled the varsity with&nbsp;a 1-2 finish, running smart races, but very different strategies.&nbsp; Katie Williams '21, somewhat inexperienced at the distance did not have the confidence to go with van den Heuvel, who went right out running 5:00 pace.&nbsp; Williams preferred running slightly behind Wicker&nbsp;about three seconds back at the 400 (78).&nbsp; Wicker was even giving Williams the advantage of being on the inside as Wicker set up in the outside of lane one.&nbsp; After a rather pedestrian lap of 80, Wicker picked up the pace and Williams never challenged.&nbsp;van den Heuvel won in 5:02.29 and Wicker was second in 5:09.59.&nbsp; Williams took third in 5:11.93.</p>
            <p align="left">There were no alumnae entries in the 60HH as Hannah Chen '18, Lee&nbsp;and Shea Landeene '20 went 1-2-3 in 9.52, 9.64 and 9.79 respectively.</p>
            <p align="left">Alexandra Taylor '14 gave it a go in the 400 and nearly got the victory.&nbsp; Instead she took second in 63.99, losing to Kristen Frombach '19 who won in 63.27.&nbsp;&nbsp;Skylar Brooks '20 was third in 64.82.</p>
            <p align="left">No alums entered the 60 Meter Dash, which was won by Michelle Menkiti '20 in 8.23.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen was a very close second in 8.24 and Strouf was equally close in third in 8.25.&nbsp; Menkiti and Chen returned a little while later in the 200 to place 1-2 in 26.65 and 26.78 respectively.</p>
            <p align="left">The 5K was also uncontested by the alumnae, which was won by Ciera Gordon '18 in 19:23.38.</p>
            <p align="left">The final event, the 4x200 was very competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooks, Jin, Frombach and Williams won by .41 seconds in 1:53.96 to Tylock, Alper, Taylor and Wicker&nbsp;in 1:54.37.</p>
            <p align="left">Those in attendance&nbsp;giving their support were Matt Barron '13, Marissa Engle '15, Maryann Gong '17, George Hansen '03, Harrison Hunter '15, Michelle Johnson '15, Eric Khatchadourian '06, Abby Klein '14, Carrington Motley '16, Uzoma Orji '06, Sarah Quinn '16, Don Shobrys '75, Omari Stephens '08, John Thomas '15, Sherry Wan '16 and Nicole Zeinstra '16.</p>
            <p align="left">The MIT team now enters their exam week before their holiday break, returning on January 8 to tune-up&nbsp;for a tri-meet at Bates College with Bates and Colby on January 13.</p>
