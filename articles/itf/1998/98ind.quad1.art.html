<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="5">For Second Year in Succession, Williams Wins Meet in

Last Event<br>

</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Last Year, the first Quad Meet of the season, Williams College hosted

MIT, Middlebury, and Norwich. The meet came down to the Pole Vault which had been delayed.

There were two vaulters remaining, one for MIT and one for Williams. Whoever won the event

would also win the meet. Williams won that meet by 1 point.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">This year, MIT is definitely in a rebuilding year. However, Williams may

still be the best team in the region but they also lost a lot to graduation and transfer.

MIT again brought the meet down to the last event with a chance to win. Williams again

proved to have the competitive and talent edge as they defeated Tech 230 to 222.

UMass/Dartmouth was a distant third with 67 points, followed by WPI with 65.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Quad Cup meets permit a school to enter up to 4 entries per event.

Similarly to the way dual meets were scored, 50% of the competitors or 8 places are scored

with the scoring being 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Therefore each event has a total of 37 points with

any one team having the possibility of scoring 27 points if they sweep the first four

places.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT began the meet by getting 18 points in the Weight Throw to Williams

nine. Mike Butville '98 led the way with a 49-0 1/2 effort for second place. Jason Dailey

'99 had a personal best of 47-11 for 4th, George Torres '99 followed with a personal best

46-1 1/2 throw for 5th, and Brian Wong '99 also threw a personal best of 41-11 for 7th

place.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The Long Jump was going on at the same time but not with the same

results. Ravi Sastry '98 won with a personal best jump of 21-11 1/2 but the only other

place earned by MIT was an 8th place by Tyson Lawrence '01 with a leap of 18-10 1/2.

Williams scored 16 points to keep the meet within 3 points.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 55 Meter High Hurdles were the next finals to finish and Sastry

continued his day of personal bests with an effort of 7.94 to win easily. Also scoring for

Tech was Jeff Daniels '01 with a huge PR of 8.74. Williams scored 17 points to pull ahead

by 1 point 42-41.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 1500, typically MIT's best event, was hindered by a last minute

injury by Leif Seed '99. This prompted Tech to switch Joel Ford from the 600. Mike Parkins

'99 continued his dominance this young season by winning in a personal best of 4:04.09.

Ford followed in fifth, with freshman Phil Loiselle taking 6th in a personal best of

4:13.13, and Sohail Husain '98 garnering 7th in 4:15.48. Nevertheless, Williams outscored

MIT by 1 point and lengthened their lead to 2.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 400 was won by MIT freshman Todd Rosenfield in 53.08. Neal Karchem

followed in third, running 53.93. Kamal Mokeddem placed 6th overall, running a personal

best of 55.03 out of the slow section. The Engineers outscored Williams 18-7 in this event

and retook the lead 77-68.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The High Jump was not a good event for either team as Williams cut the

lead in half by outscoring Tech 11-7.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Williams star sophomore thrower, Dave Stuhlsatz, won the Shot Put with a

toss of 52-11 1/2, but MIT outscored the Ephmen 16-15. Patrick Dannen '98 led the way with

a personal best of 43-7 for 2nd place. Also with a personal best was Torres with a throw

of 42-0 for 5th. Butville followed in 6th and freshman Brian Rogers placed 7th.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 600 was supposed to be a big event for Tech but an injury to Sean

Montgomery '01 and switching Ford to the 1500 left the Engineers with untested ability in

the event. Ed Tolson '01 was able to secure 4th with a 1:30.82. Other MIT runners who

placed were Gus Blomquist in 5th, Ashley Clayborne '99 in 6th, and Tony Pelosi in 8th.

Despite the slow times, MIT only lost 2 points to Williams and still led overall by 4.</font>

</p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT's only sprinter is hurdler/jumper Ravi Sastry. Ravi ran 6.88 to get

5th place for Tech's only points. Williams scored 16 to take an 8 point overall lead.</font>

</p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Williams College Decathlon All-American, Derek Sasaki-Scanlon won the

Pole Vault, but MIT took 2nd - 5th places to outscore Williams 22-15, and pull within 1

point. Matt Potts '00 led the way with a personal best of 13-0. Following were Sam

Thibault '00 in 3rd, Sam Sidiqi '99 in 4th, and Steve Lefkowitz '00 in 5th.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Ford came back in the 800 and won with a time of 2:01.77. Freshman Ken

Walker ran a great race and garnered 2nd place with a 2:02.23 personal best. Chuck Van

Buren '98 secured 4th place, and Jeff Billing '01 ran to 7th place. This turned out to be

the Engineers best event as they scored 23 points to Williams 13, thus giving MIT a 9

point lead.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Parkins followed Ford's effort with a win of his own in the 1000,

running a personal best of 2:37.22. Husain doubled back from the 1500 and earned 4th

place, and Ray Molnar '00 faded in the last lap but held on to 6th. MIT lost 2 points to

Williams but maintained a 7 point lead.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT's weakness in the sprints showed up again in the 200. Although all

of Tech's runners ran season bests, they were only able to score 6th, 7th, and 8th places.

Sastry led the way with 24.18. He was followed by Karchem and Rosenfield. Williams now had

a 3 point lead with only 4 events to go.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT needed some points and Parkins was asked if he could run sub 16:00

after his already busy day, without getting hurt. He said he could and indeed he did,

running 15:44.08 for 4th. Chris McGuire '00 returned from the injured list to run his

first race of the season and get 2nd place with a 15:33.09. Running personal bests were

freshmen Mark Strauss, 15:51.63 for 5th, and Ed Keehr 16:19.21 for 7th. The strategy

worked and MIT now had a 5 point lead.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The Triple Jump did not work out the MIT's advantage as Williams

outscored Tech 14-7. Leading the way for MIT was freshman Kalpak Kothari with a personal

best of 41-2 1/2 for 5th place. Sastry was 7th with 38-3 1/2, and Lawrence was 8th.

Williams now led by 2 with only the relays to go.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Because only 3 of the 4 teams declared for the two relays, the scoring

was to be 9-6-0. This of course meant that MIT would have to either beat Williams in both

relays or win one and have Williams finish 3rd (which was very unlikely). The stage was

set and the Johnson Athletic Center was rocking. One could hardly hear anything as the

Williams and MIT athletes were spread around the track.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Tech decided to load the 1600 Relay with their remaining resources. Not

having Seed and Montgomery certainly limited the strategy. Tech remained right on Williams

back until 150 meters to go when Sasaki-Scanlon pulled away from Karchem. The team of

Rosenfield, Martin Suresh '99, Ford, and Karchem ran 3:34.02.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">With only the 3200 Relay, MIT had to win and hope that Williams finish

3rd. It was not to be. Tech fell behind at the beginning and never recovered. The quartet

of Husain, Walker, Van Buren, and Loiselle finished in 2nd with a 8:24.77.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Next week, the 2-1 Engineers travel to Bates to face Bowdoin, Colby, and

Southern Maine. </font></p>
