<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="5">Tech Takes Advantage of Depleted Tufts' Squad to

Finish Season 12-1<br>

</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The MIT Track and Field Team entertained Tufts, Coast Guard, and

Middlebury College on the final weekend of the Quad Cup Season, and came away with a

resounding victory; 258 to 186 to 110 to 28 respectively.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The long time rivalry between MIT and Tufts had been intensifying as the

meet approached. The two evenly matched teams were vying for second place in the Quad Cup,

as well as bragging rights in this latest installment of the rivalry that has spanned at

least two decades. In nearly every event, except for the Pole Vault, whichever team had

the better day would walk away with the event. Based on seeds alone, MIT had the edge by 5

points.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">At the coaches' meeting prior to the meet it became clear that for at

least this meet, the rivalry would have to take a leave of absence. Tufts scratched

athlete after athlete due to illness or injury, all but assuring a victory for the

Engineers.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT never trailed in this meet, outscoring Tufts in the first 3 events

(Long Jump, Pole Vault, and Weight Throw) by a score of 66-19. Leading this initial

onslaught was a sweep of the first 4 places in the Pole Vault by Sam Thibault '00, Matt

Potts '00, Sam Sidiqi '99, and Sam Towell '00. Jason Dailey '99 had a big breakthrough in

the Weight Throw with a 3 foot PR of 50-08 3/4 for 2nd place. Following in 3rd and 4th

were Mike Butville '98 (47-04), and George Torres '99 (46-08) respectively. Ravi Sastry

'98, scored the first of his 42 points with a victory in the Long Jump (21-04).</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Tech never looked back. Mike Parkins '99 led the typically strong middle

distance-distance runners with a strategic victory in the Mile (4:23.85). Mike was

followed with strong efforts from Chris McGuire '00 (5th), Phil Loiselle '01 (6th), and

Ken Walker '01 (7th).</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT outscored Tufts in the short events as well. Sastry won the 55,

55HH, and 200 Meter races to lead Tech to a 57-28 advantage in those events.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 400 runners were led by Todd Rosenfield '01, who claimed 2nd place

with a 52.44, missing out on 1st place by .05 seconds. Neal Karchem '99, also ran a

personal indoor best with a 53.14 clocking for 3rd place. Even so, Tufts outscored MIT

17-15.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Tufts also won the 600 Meter run by a score of 13-11. The 600 had been

one of Tech's weakest events all season and that trend continued despite season bests by

Martin Suresh '99 (1:28.02), and Ashley Clayborne '99 (1:28.48)</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">An indication of how evenly matched MIT and Tufts were was evident in

the 800 and 1000 meters. Typically MIT's best events, particularly when Parkins or McGuire

double back from the Mile, Tufts outscored MIT 37-24 in the two events. In the 800, the

top 8 places all ran 2:02 or better, and in the 1000, the top 7 places were at 2:41 or

better.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Parkins returned in the 3000 with the same results as in the 1500, a

victory, running a season best of 8:45.5. McGuire began to return to last year's form with

a 8:58.23 effort for 4th. A personal best of 9:01.50 was turned in by Rich Rosalez '98,

good enough for 7th place.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Although the Triple Jump is a weak event this year for MIT, it is even

weaker for other teams. Tech earned 1st and 2nd places by Kalpak Kothari '01 (41-00 1/2),

and Tyson Lawrence '01 (40-03 1/4).</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Patrick Dannen '98, continued his dominance in the Shot Put with a 44-02

1/4 effort, good enough for 1st place. Other Tech scorers were Butville in 4th (41-09),

Torres in 5th (41-03 3/4), and Brian Rogers '01 in 7th (38-11).</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The Engineers finished the regular season with a 12-1 record and 2nd to

Williams in the Quad Cup Series. Next week, MIT will host the non-scoring Quad Cup

Invitational.</font> </p>
