<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="5">TECH TAKES DOWN SPRINGFIELD AT HOME IN 3RD QUAD CUP<br>

</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT Men's Track and Field Team came off of a poor performance last week

in Lewiston against Bates College with a grand showing at home against Springfield College

in Cambridge. MIT began well and finished even better as they outscored the Chiefs in the

middle distance and distance events (800, 1000, 1500, 5000) by a score of 92-12.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Tech began with troubling results but okay scores in the Weight Throw,

Long Jump, and High Jump. MIT was down to Springfield 25-29 at that point and really had

not done too well. Ravi Sastry '98 won the High Jump with a leap of 6-0, and place 2nd in

the Long Jump with a 21-2 effort. However, MIT only scored 5 more points in those two

events. WPI was actually leading at this point with 33 points as they scored nearly half

of their points in the first three events. </font></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Quad Cup scoring is 9 points for 1st place and 7,6,5,4,3,2,1 for the

next 7 places respectively. Each school is allowed 4 entries per event, so it is possible

to score 27 points in an event.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the 1500, Mike Parkins '99 led the 1,3,4,5 finish with a 4:02.41 solo

effort that put the Beavers ahead to stay. Following Parkins were Phil Loiselle '01, Ken

Walker '01, and Rich Rosalez '98.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Sastry remained undefeated in the High Hurdles with a 8.05 effort.

Junius Ho '01 picked up another 5 points with a personal best 8.52.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the Pole Vault, once again MIT asserted their dominance with 23 1/2

points. Leading the way was Matt Potts '00 with a vault of 12-06. Other place winners for

Tech named Sam were Sam Thibault '00, Sam Sidiqi '99, and Sam Towell '00.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Todd Rosenfield lost his first quad meet in the 400 but ran a personal

best of 52.61 for 3rd place.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 600 was far better for the Engineers than in previous meets. Moving

Neal Karchem '99 (4th with 1:28.38), and the return of Martin Suresh '99, led Tech to 12

points in the event.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT has not done well in the sprints this winter but not because Sastry

is not running well and improving a lot. Ravi ran a big personal best of 6.78 to get a

close second.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">If there was any doubt who was going to win this meet it evaporated

after the next two events (800, 1000). Mike Parkins remained undefeated with a 2:01.77,

and was followed by a personal best from Gus Blomquist '99 who ran a 2:05.04 for 3rd

place. Also placing in 6th and 7th were Ed Tolson '01, and Ray Molnar '00.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 1000 was more of the same. Joel Ford '98 broke out of his slump with

a 2:35.72 run for an easy victory. Personal bests by Sohail Husain '98 (2:38.55), Loiselle

(2:41.15), and Walker (2:43.15) gave Tech 24 points in the event.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The remaining field events, Triple Jump and Shot Put, were big surprises

for MIT. In the Shot, Patrick Dannen '98, threw nearly 1 1/2 feet further than he ever has

(45-01 1/2) for 4th place. Mike Butville '98 followed with his own personal best of 42-09

for 6th. Kalpak Kothari '01 came from behind on his last jump to win the Triple with a

personal best of 41-05 3/4. Following Kalpak were Tyson Lawrence '01 in 3rd and Ho in 6th.</font>

</p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 200 continued to be a troubling event for MIT. Neal Karchem

recovered well enough from the 600 to snag 7th place but that would be it for the

Engineers.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 5000 saw a great finish by MIT. Chris McGuire ran away with the race

right from the beginning. However a great race developed for 3rd. Ed Keehr '01, Liyan Guo

'01, and Mark Strauss '01, had worked their way up to 3rd-5th positions with a little over

3 laps to go. With 2 laps to go, McGuire lapped them and the Westfield State runner they

had just passed. When the bell rang for the bell lap, the Westfield runner mistakenly

thought it was for all of them, not just Chris. He sprinted past all of them and stopped

thinking he had won only to find out that he had been lapped and was now losing 3rd-5th

place. He continued, but could not muster the will to catch the Tech runners.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The relays were a formality and MIT used them to give some people a good

workout. A dropped baton in the 1600 Relay gave Tech a last place finish and no points.

However, the 3200 Relay was a surprising victory as outstanding efforts were contributed

by Molnar, and Chuck Van Buren '98.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Next week, MIT is host in the final Quad Cup Meet of the season to rival

Tufts, and Coast Guard. </font></p>
