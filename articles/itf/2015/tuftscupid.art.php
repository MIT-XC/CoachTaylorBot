              <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Relays Shine at BU and Tufts Meets</span></p>
              <p align="left">February 7, 2015</p>
              <p align="left">Entering the next to last weekend to qualify for the New England Division III Championship (NED3) the MIT Track &amp; Field teams went about their business of getting ready for four consecutive weeks of Championships. While some distance runners took the weekend off from competing, the women's team competed at the <a href="tuftscupid.res.php">Tufts Cupid Challenge</a> while the men's team split, sending most of their top runners to Boston University for the <a href="http://www.directathletics.com/results/track/37367_m.html">Scarlet and White Invitational</a>, and the remainder of those competing to Tufts.</p>
              <p align="left">While the focus for those competing was to win their competitions, there was extra incentive to do well as the focus moves to the championships. Some were looking to qualify or improve their qualifying marks for Nationals, while others were trying to either qualify for the New England Division III Championships or improve their performance to get into the faster sections in the running events.</p>
              <p align="left">The women began things with the Distance Medley Relay (DMR) at Tufts. The intent was to run in the 11:40's but the total lack of competition was going to be a concern. The flat track and the fact there were only two other teams, both of which MIT would lap once with a poor race and twice with a great race, meant MIT was going to be challenged. Christina Wicker '17 was trying to run as close to 3:30 as possible in the 1200, Hannah Chen '18 would run the 400 leg and hope for a 58, Cindy Huang '15 was looking for a 2:15 or so in the 800 and Maryann Gong '17 wanted to anchor the 1600 leg with a 4:50. Whether it was the lack of competition or being too excited and going out too fast, three of the four just could not get it done at the level they were hoping for. Wicker went out too fast with a 32 first 200 so that by the 600 she was already running 37 seconds for the third 200. She competed well but paid for the early error, finishing with a 3:40 leg. Chen delivered with a 58.1 split, but Huang made the same error as Wicker, going out in 32. She was on at 67 for the 400, but her 36 third 200 and 38 final lap brought her in at 2:21 and far off her expected time. Gong went out in 33 as opposed to the 36 she was hoping for, and while she managed pretty well through the 800 at 2:24, she fell to a 2:35 final 800 for a 4:59 1600. The overall time of 12:01.08 is the leading time in the country for DIII for now but is not likely to hold up. The quartet will have to run it again in a few weeks when they can face some favorable competition.</p>
              <p align="left">Haley Strouf '18, making a try at qualifying for the NED3 Pentathlon, had an exceptional day in her five events. She started off with a personal best in the 60HH, running a 10.33. She also had personal best in three other events, a 4-7 3/4 in the High Jump, a throw of 31-6 1/2 in the Shot Put and a 2:59.59 800. She jumped a solid 16-3 in the Long Jump to total 2605 points to qualify for the NED3 Championship.</p>
              <p align="left">Veronica Szklarzewski '15 had a big day, running a season best 7.96 in the 60 Meter Dash for third place, tying her personal best. Later in the meet, she ran a 26.68 200 to place third in that event. She also took third place honors in the Long Jump at 16-3 3/4.</p>
              <p align="left">Kayla Harris '15 is quickly rounding into shape as she comes back from four years of dealing with a knee injury. Her 60.94 400 is a collegiate best, providing much needed support in that area. Harris came back with a 26.96 200.</p>
              <p align="left">Elaine McVay '15 ran a personal best in the 3K as she led from start to finish in 10:04.66. Four other victories were turned in by Tech athletes. Ellen Liverpool '15 delivered in the Weight Throw at 53-6 1/4. Huang came back after the DMR and ran an excellent personal best of 1:38.48 to win the 600. Her performance was the third fastest all-time by an MIT runner. Isabella Stuopis '16 earned first place honors with a 40-7 3/4 put in the Shot. Last but not least, Cimmy Virdi '16 scored a victory in the Pole Vault with an 11-11 3/4 effort.</p>
              <p align="left">The highlights of the Engineers' field event dominance were the Weight Throw and Pole Vault. Ashley Wheeler '15 and Jackie Vahey '17 threw PR's of 50-1 1/4 and 49-9 3/4 respectively to join Liverpool for a 1-2-3 sweep. Joining Virdi were Abby Klein '15 in second at 11-5 3/4, Maeve Devlin '18 in fifth at 10-6 and Joanna Chen '15 in sixth at 10-6.</p>
              <p align="left">The men making the trip to BU represented their team well. As with the women, the men were hoping to come away with an NCAA Division III leading relay time, this one in the 4x400. The quartet of States Lee '16, Derek Barnes '16, Michael Kaba '16 and Luca Cacopardo '18 were hoping to break 3:15 in the first effort of the year. All would be running the open 400 prior to the relay, but that has never stopped the juniors on the team who have been three time All America winners in the relay in one indoor and two outdoor NCAA Championships. Lee led off, made a strategic error on the backstretch, but finished well with a 48.4 leg. Barnes had a much better handoff than usual, ran a strong first 200, but faded in the final 100 to close in 49.4. Kaba produced perhaps his best leg ever, catching up to the leaders, putting MIT in third with a 48.3 leg. Cacopardo, lacking confidence because of a disappointing open 400, got out slowly and never quite displayed the intensity he has shown prior to this weekend. He did however run the best he could with the mental attitude he had going into the race, anchoring a 49.8 to give Tech a 3:16.12, good for the second fastest time in Division III. Similar to the women the men will have to put in a better performance over the next few weeks.</p>
              <p align="left"> Kaba  began the day with a season best of 8.49 in the 60HH. He followed that up with a 49.00 personal best in the 400 before his excellent relay leg. Lee ran a season best of 48.62 in the open 400, and if he had not been pushed out to lane two at the break and then had his heel clipped entering the final turn, he would have probably bettered his MIT record of 48.36. Barnes ran a personal indoor best of 49.18 in the open race. </p>
              <p align="left">The Mile went very well for MIT as all four runners produced indoor personal bests. Colin Godwin '17 came away with the top time for MIT on this day, running 64 second quarters all the way for a 4:16.30. Nick O'Connell '18 showed his talents as he closed in a 61 to run 4:16.48 in his section of the Mile. Benji Xie '15 dropped down from the 5K to run 4:17. 49. Matt Deyo '16, leading most of the race, used too much energy doing so, but still managed a 4:17.77.</p>
              <p align="left">Sam Parker '15 ran a personal best in the 800, running 27.5 200's through 600 meters for a 1:22.5 and then finishing in 29 for a 1:51.66, good for third on the NCAA Division III ranking.</p>
              <p align="left">Back at Tufts, minus so many of the top runners, MIT only claimed three victories. Ken Cooper '15 earned his customary two wins, earning first place honors in both the Weight Throw and the Shot Put. Cooper threw 55-10 1/2 and 49-7 respectively.</p>
              <p align="left">Arinze Okeke '17 took the other victory, jumping 46-7 1/4 in the Triple Jump. Okeke led his teammates to a 1-3-4-6 finish as Billy Ruschel '18 (44-5 1/4), Carrington Motley '16 (44-2 1/2) and Ryan Prinster '18 (42-6) competed in the final event of the day.</p>
              <p align="left">Two of the distance runners competing, both freshmen, showed the biggest improvement on the day. Cooper Sloan earned second place in the 5K with a personal best of 15:12.56. David Walter moved up in distance to tackle the 3K and did so admirably. His 8:50.62 is a personal best and took third place in the event.</p>
              <p align="left">The only other performance of significance was in the 400 where Danny Newman '17 won his section with a flat track indoor personal best of 52.40.</p>
              <p align="left">Next week, the final weekend to qualify for the championships, many of the oval runners will be at Boston University for the David Hemery Valentine's Classic while the majority of the field event athletes with be competing at the MIT Gordon Kelly Invitational.</p>
