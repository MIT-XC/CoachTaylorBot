<P>This Saturday at MIT, visiting Williams College, won the third
Quad Cup Meet of the season. In a match of unbeatens, Williams lived
up to their favorite's role by winning with a score of 256 points to
210.5 for MIT, 83.5 for Bates, and 41 for WPI.</P>

<P>Since Coach Halston Taylor arrived at MIT in the 1982-83 season,
the Engineers have faced Williams once per year for each of those 16
years. Williams won that first battle, but MIT took the next 8 in a
row during a time when Division III Titles were commonplace for the
Track and Field Team. Since 1992, Williams has been unbeatable.
Though unbeatable, MIT has come close to taking them down. In 1997,
Tech visited Williams and came within 1 point of upsetting the Ephs.
In 1998, it came down to the relays, and once again Williams pulled
it out with an 8 point victory. Going into this 17th matchup, with
both teams having won 8 of the previous 16, Williams was favored to
win by 20-30 points, but that is not many points in a quad meet.</P>

<P>The teams were fairly evenly matched across the board with a few
different strengths and weaknesses. While both teams have great
strength in the middle distance and distance races, Williams also had
good strength in the sprints and Shot Put. MIT had relative strength
in the vertical jumps. For MIT, one unknown was going to be the
readiness of Ravi Sastry '98, and Robbie Gray '02, sprinters/jumpers
who were both returning from hamstring injuries, but were no where
near full strength.</P>

<P>The meet began with the Long Jump. Mirach of Williams was seeded
number 1,but Sastry extended his second attempt to 22-0 to clinch the
victory. It was a good thing Mirach was unable to challenge that
effort because Ravi strained his hamstring in an attempt to get a
better landing, and was finished in the LJ. Todd Rosenfield '01, was
consistently landing at 20', but fouled all attempts. Kalpak Kothari
'01, jumping a foot behind the board, managed a 6th place with a 19-5
1/4 effort. Nevertheless, Williams took the event by a 17 to 12
score.</P>

<P>Finishing about the same time was the 35Lb. Weight Throw. Bates
and WPI took the top 3 spots, and Todd Chamoy '99, had a personal
best of 48-5 1/4 to garner a 4th for MIT. Jason Dailey '99, had a
poor day, throwing 5 feet under his best to finish a disappointing
7th. Fortunately for MIT, Williams did poorly with a only a 5th place
finish for 4 points to bring the cumulative score to 21-19 in
Williams favor.</P>

<P>On the track, the 1500 was getting underway. Williams was forced
to double their top distance runner, Paul Alsdorf, who is the number
1 ranked 5K runner in the country for Division III. MIT's task was to
have their great set of milers sweep Alsdorf to possibly get the
momentum in their favor. Alsdorf took the lead right from the start
in order to prevent MIT taking the event with a strong kick off of a
slow pace. The first quarter was a solid 63. The second 400 slowed to
2:09, but it was still Alsdorf leading followed very closely by the
MIT quartet of Sean Montgomery '01, Dan Feldman '02, Mike Parkins
'99, and Leif Seed '99. Then things heated up with Alsdorf picking up
the pace with a 62 quarter. This shook all but Montgomery, however
the other Tech runners ran a 65 and were still unchallenged. In the
final 300 meters, Montgomery tried to pass Alsdorf many times, but
each time Alsdorf picked up the pace. In the final straight,
Montgomery pulled even, and finally took the victory at the line with
a nationally qualifying time of 3:56.48 to 3:56.78 for Alsdorf.
Feldman finished 3rd with a personal best of 4:01.99, and Parkins a
season best of 4:02.30 for 4th. Unfortunately, Tech's top miler,
Seed, did not finish well, dropping to 7th in 4:05.05. MIT was now
leading 41 to 36.</P>

<P>The High Hurdles, and the test for Sastry's hamstring were next.
Sastry's best time of the year was 8.01 while Rossier of Williams has
run 8.02. Ravi came through with a season best of 7.90 to 8.01 for
Rossier. The plan was for Jordan Alperin '02, and Peter Bluvas '01 to
each beat a William's opponent seeded just in front of them. Alperin
did not run his best race,but garnered a 5th place with a 8.47 behind
the three Williams hurdlers. Bluvas finished 6th with a 8.57.</P>

<P>Back on the infield, the High Jump was finishing. Sastry, not
missing any attempts, was the only one to clear 6-0 on his first
attempt. A WPI jumper was the only other one to clear 6-0, and
eventually cleared 6-2. Sastry's hamstring was bothering him too much
to make the effort at 6-2, and conceded the victory. Although he
jumped no where near his 6-2 season best, Alperin did come through
for 3rd place with a 5-10 effort. Roger Nielsen '01, jumped well at
5-10 to secure 4th place, and Sam Sidiqi '99 tied for 7th to give MIT
a 76.5 to 57 point edge.</P>

<P>The 400/600 sections were supposed to be in MIT's favor, but
whenever you have to split your long sprinters up, guess which race
will be their most competitive, and still have 4 potential scorers
per race, it is an educated guess at best. Even though Rosenfield did
not get the break, he ran a very aggressive 2nd lap, taking the race
at the line in a huge personal best of 51.64. Neal Karchem '99, was
not able to give close support, but did come through with a 5th
place. Kamal Mokeddem '01, and Ashley Clayborne '99, added 7th and
8th places to give MIT a 16-14 edge in the 400.</P>

<P>The 600 was probably the most disappointing for Tech. Williams put
their top two long sprinters in the race, but Tech's freshmen Yuval
Mazor, and Alan Raphael, were expected to give adequate chase. The
outcome was very different as Williams went 1,2,5, and 7. Yuval
managed a personal best of 1:26.57 for third, but Raphael only
managed a 6th. Senior, Gus Blomquist, added an 8th place for 1 more
point, but the 22-10 Williams edge was going to be hard to come back
from. MIT still had a 102.5 to 93 lead, but Williams strength was
still to come.</P>

<P>The Pole Vault was finishing, and once again, MIT did not seize an
easy opportunity for points. Enduring a very bad ankle all season,
Sam Thibault '00, once again led the Engineers with a 13-0 vault for
2nd place. Matt Potts '00, did not fare so well, only clearing 12-0
for 6th. Sidiqi again came through for 8th, but freshman Dan Kwon
no-heighted. The 11-5 difference was not as much as hoped for.</P>

<P>The anticipated superiority of Williams sprinters was as bad as
expected. Sastry again held together with an amazing 3rd place
finish, but weakened Gray could only manage a 7th place. Williams
cruised to take the event 25-8, and take the lead 123 to 121.5.</P>

<P>The 800 was supposed to be a match between the undefeated
Montgomery, with a 1:56 seed, going up against the fresh Hennessey,
with a 1:57 seed, from Williams. Hennessey took it out similar to the
strategy employed by Alsdorf in the 1500. Coming through splits of
28, 56, and 1:26, Montgomery took the lead in the final straight to
win in a very fast 1:55.65 to 1:56.52 for Hennessey. Fighting off a
cold, Parkins ran tough and finished 4th with a 2:02.40. Also placing
for MIT were John Biesiadecki '01, with a 2:03.99 for 5th, and an 8th
by Kenny Walker '01. Again, the 19-15 edge by MIT was less than
expected.</P>

<P>The last strong event for the Engineers would be the 1000 meters.
Again it was an MIT runner doubling back expecting to take on a fresh
Williams runner for the victory. This time Leif Seed ran off of Li
from Williams through a comfortable pace of 31, 62, and 1:35. Seed,
impatient, took the lead perhaps a little too soon. He came through
the half in 2:05. On the final backstretch, Li took the lead and Seed
could not respond. Li won in 2:34.96 to Seed's 2:35.93. Phil Loiselle
'01, gave chase with a personal best of 2:36.20, and Feldman ran very
tough for a 2:37.17 personal best, good enough for 4th. Ray Molnar
'00, added a 2:41.39 personal best for 6th. MIT had reclaimed a 161.5
to 154.</P>

<P>The Shot Put, as predicted, went to Williams 21-1. As noted by an
email from an Alumnus, MIT shot putters cannot seem to break 40'.
Bluvas, having to relearn to throw the shot correctly, is almost back
to where he was with improper technique, and he garnered the lone MIT
point with a 39-8 toss. Williams was now ahead for good.</P>

<P>If the Shot Put was the stunning blow, the 200 was the knockout
punch. Williams domination in the 55 was magnified in the 200, as
Sastry is not ready to run the deuce, and Gray is not ready to run
one fast. As a result, Williams swept the first 4 places for a
dominating 27-9 point difference. A 7 1/2 point MIT lead had gone to
a 30 1/2 deficit in just two events.</P>

<P>Not knowing these results by the time it was necessary to finalize
the 3000 lineup, Coach Taylor substituted a game Feldman for Liyan
Guo in hopes of scoring every point possible. Alsdorf, having already
run an 8:25 this year, doubled back along with a strong group of
distance runners from Williams. For MIT, a fresh Mark Strauss '01,
and Chris McGuire '00, and Ed Keehr '01, would join Feldman in what
everyone still thought of as a chance for a team victory. With 800
meters to go Alsdorf and McCue from Williams pulled away from Strauss
and McGuire to eventually go 1-3 in 8:41 and 8:44. Strauss finished
4th in a personal best of 8:45.27, and McGuire ran 8:46.40 in a
personal best for 6th. Feldman had a very gutsy performance to finish
8th in 8:58.</P>

<P>The 1600 Relay was one of the best races of the day, even though
the outcome of the meet was already decided. Mazor led off with a
strong 52.4 leg, and despite a poor handoff to Rosenfield, Tech had a
lead after Todd's 51.4 effort. Karchem ran strong, but his 52.4 was
not enough to hold Williams at bay. Montgomery made up 15 of the 20
meters on Williams with his 50.2 anchor, but it was not enough. Both
teams ran season bests of 3:25.7 and 3:26.2 respectively.</P>

<P>The Distance Medley Relay also went to Williams as MIT backed off.
This left the Triple Jump to complete the day's events. On the 2nd
round of the finals, Kothari nailed an indoor best of 43-9 1/2 to
take the lead over Mirach of Williams. However, on his last attempt,
Mirach pulled it out with a leap of 43-11 1/4 to epitomize Williams
efforts in the meet. Gray added a third place along with a 5th from
Thibault to give MIT 17 points in the event.</P>

<P>This was a hard fought battle between MIT and Williams. The MIT
seniors missed their last opportunity to take Williams down in a
regular season meet, but perhaps the freshmen learned what it will
take to get the job done in the future.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT completes the Quad Cup regular season with an
opportunity to finish 11-1 against Springfield, Bowdoin, and
Westfield State at home.</P>
