              <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Men and Women Claim 19 All America Honors</span></p>
              <p align="left">March 11-12, 2011 </p>
              <p align="left">The Engineers represented MIT well at the <a href="ncaa.res.php">NCAA Division III Track and Field Championship</a>, hosted by Capital University in Columbus, Ohio. Fifteen MIT athletes earned the right to compete at this prestigious championship where an athlete generally has to be among the top 11-14 in the country to make the field.</p>
              <p align="left">Starting off the competition for Tech was Hazel Briner '11, in the Pentathlon. Briner was seeded ninth, but expected to duplicate or improve on last year's third place finish. The start of the 55HH, the first event in the Pent. was probably an omen as to how the rest of the event would go. Standing up at the gun, possibly her worst start in two years, put her significantly behind the field. Nevertheless she ran 8.72 as she ran extremely well once she got moving. In the high jump portion of the event, she jumped pretty well. While not matching her best of 5-2, she did clear 4-11 3/4 to put herself in seventh place overall and only 34 points out of second. What used to be her best event in the pent., the shot put, has abandoned her recently. Briner was only able to manage a 29-9 1/2 throw, which put her back in 10th place. In the long jump portion of the event, Briner was not able to match her best of 17-6, as she took off over a foot behind the board each time, only jumping 15-7 1/2 to slip to 11th place. The final event, the 800, went well, but it was too little, too late. Briner paced it perfectly, opening up with a 34 first 200. She let the pace slip a little in the middle but closed well to set an NCAA record for the pentathlon 800 with her 2:22.51 performance. Unfortunately, this only moved her up to ninth place.</p>
              <p align="left">Portia Jones '12, had a busy thirty minutes, first running 8.19 to set a new personal best in the 55HH. Jones won her heat and had the second fastest time in the trials. Half an hour later she was in the blocks for the 400 trials. Taking the eight fastest times out of the four heats, Jones knew she had to run fast. Being the ninth seed going into the race, she was placed in the same heat as the fastest seed and one other who had run faster. The first 200 was blazing and Jones dropped back, no longer competing for first. She got passed at the line, finishing in 57.01. However, no one else in any of the heats ran faster than her, so she enters the finals with the third fastest time.</p>
              <p align="left">Nathan Peterson '12, has moved into contention for the most improved award with his amazing performances in the Pole Vault over the past four weeks. Struggling in the regular season to even clear 14', Peterson had a breakthrough in mid-February when he cleared 15-5. He repeated this performance to win the New England Division III title, then cleared 15-7 at the All New England Championship. Last week at the ECAC Championship he made another breakthrough, clearing 16-5 1/4 to qualify for the NCAA Championship as the eighth seed. Peterson's first time at Nationals certainly did not seem to phase him as he cleared the opening height of 15-5 with over a foot to spare and did the same with 15-11. It took him two attempts to clear 16-5, but then he nailed 16-9 1/2 on his first attempt to set a new MIT record and put himself in the thick of the scoring. Peterson made excellent attempts at 17-1, but not quite enough to clear. His effort earned him All America honors in a tie for fifth place.</p>
              <p align="left">In the Men's Weight Throw, Ken Cooper '13, and CK Umachi '12, entered the competition seeded 12th and 14th respectively. Both throwers had been having technical issues that they tried to work out in the final week. It proved to be too little too late for the pair. Umachi looked good in warmups and on his first throw hit his positions pretty well, releasing the weight and watching it land over 62', only to get called on a late toe foul call. This demoralized Umachi who only managed a 54-10 3/4 afterwards. Cooper threw in the second flight. He consistently stepped in late on his second turn, managing only 56-3 1/4. Both throwers will be much better the next time they compete in this meet.</p>
              <p align="left">Both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s DMR&#8217;s placed 6th. &nbsp;Both teams had been dealing with illnesses, but managed to compete very well for every position. &nbsp;Louise van den Heuvel &#8216;14, shook off the effects of her still lingering cold and ran a nice 3:41 leadoff 1200. &nbsp;Martha Gross &#8216;12, thirty meters behind the pack when she came around the first turn, followed with a 59 400 and Jamie Simmons &#8216;12, ran a hard fought 2:19 800 leg to put MIT in 5th place. &nbsp;Anna Holt-Gosselin &#8216;11, who is coming back to run the 5K on Saturday, ran an excellent 5:01 1600 on the tight turned track to place sixth, just missing fifth place at the line.<br />
                <br />
The men led off with Logan Trimble &#8216;13, who had had a severe cold and was still not up to full strength. &nbsp;Nevertheless, Trimble ran a very competitive 3:06 leg to put MIT in ninth place. &nbsp;DJ Ronde &#8216;13, was in limbo throughout his 400, but ran 51.4, a solid leg, to keep MIT in ninth. &nbsp;Pat Marx &#8216;13, opened his 800 leg with a 25.4 first 200 to get MIT back in the thick of the race. &nbsp;This took its toll on Marx, particularly since he is still not up to full strength after having his appendix out four weeks ago. &nbsp;Marx ran tough moving MIT up to seventh place with a 1:55 leg. &nbsp;Kyle Hannon &#8216;13, fought off his foot injury and the mental doubts he has been having and competed extraordinarily well. &nbsp;Opening up with a 59 first 400 got him up with the leaders, but also took a lot out of him. &nbsp;Hannon stayed competitive, running 4:11 to move MIT up to sixth place. </p>
              <p align="left">Day two was everything MIT could have hoped for. The Women's Pole Vault led things off for MIT, who had three entries in the event, including a tie for the top seed, Karin Fisher '11. The opening height was 11' and both Hazel Briner and Lauren Kuntz '13, cleared it on the first attempt. At 11-6, Kuntz cleared on first attempt and Briner on the second attempt. At 12' 1/2&quot;, again both Kuntz and Briner cleared on first attempt. While neither cleared a higher height this proved to be enough to score as Kuntz tied for sixth and Briner placed eighth. Fisher came in at 12', cleared that on first attempt as well as 12-4, 12-8 and 13-0. Going to 13-4 1/4 there were only two vaulters remaining, Fisher and the other top seed, Abigail Schaffer of Moravian College. Schaffer cleared 13-4 on her second attempt while Fisher needed three attempts. Fisher needed to make the next height to have a chance of winning but could not quite manage 13-8, which Schaffer did clear for a new NCAA Division III record. The 11.5 points earned by MIT gave them 14.5 total so far.</p>
              <p align="left">The 55HH final was being run in two sections since the track was incapable of eight sprint or hurdle lanes. The first section ran very fast with the top two running 8.10 and 8.11. Jones was in the second section. Having her best start of the year and a technically sound race, she ran a personal best of 8.11, easily winning her section. She tied for second place, but felt she would have won had she been able to go head to head with those in the first section. Nevertheless, it was seven more points for MIT, giving them 21.5.</p>
              <p align="left">Jones was back up thirty minutes later, this time in the finals of the 400. Again involved in a two section final, Jones ran her best flat track 400 ever. Controlling her first 200 in a 26.6, allowed her to finish strong in 56.44. She finished third in her section, but only one in the other section ran faster, giving her fourth place and five more points. MIT now stood at 26.5, which was starting to look like they might have a shot at top four overall and another NCAA team trophy.</p>
              <p align="left">Holt-Gosselin in the 5K was next for MIT. The initial pace was very quick, 1:16 for the first 400 and 2:37 for the 800. The top three pulled away at this point, leaving Holt-Gosselin back with the main pack and in eighth place as the pack maintained perfect 83 second 400's. Holt-Gosselin came through 1600 splits of 5:23 and 10:56. At this point, the pack pulled away from her. After another 400 at 83, Holt-Gosselin slowed to 86 for two 400's as she had no one to pace off of. With 600 meters to go, she sped up, which was needed to hold off a fast closing Keene State runner. Holt-Gosselin finished with a 38 final 200 to run 17:12.00 for eighth place, giving her another All America honor and MIT one more point.</p>
              <p align="left">With only the 4x400 relay remaining, MIT had locked up third place for their third consecutive NCAA Division III Championship (Outdoor '10, Cross Country '10). The 4x400 runners were probably unaware of the team standings, only knowing their team was close and needed one more great event. There were three seeded sections of the 4x400 with MIT in the second section. Jamie Simmons took up her customary leadoff duties and battled wonderfully, bringing the baton home in first, running 58.8 on the slow track. Briner performed an excellent exchange, also running a great leg, keeping MIT in front with a 59.0 leg. Another perfect handoff to Martha Gross shot MIT into the lead, which Gross held until the handoff, running a 59.2 split. Yet another great exchange to Jones produced a nice gap for MIT. Jones built the lead throughout the leg, running 57.0 to give MIT the section win in 3:54.03. In the final section, all four teams ran faster than MIT, giving the Engineers fifth place overall.</p>
              <p align="left">In addition to the third place team finish for the women and 28th place for the men, MIT garnered 19 total All America honors for 13 different athletes.</p>
              <p align="left">These athletes earned a week off before they get back to working towards the NCAA Division III Outdoor Championship at the end of May.</p>
