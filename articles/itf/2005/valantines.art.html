  <p><font size="+3">62-6 3/4 Weight Throw Sets MIT Record and Leads Country in 
    Division III</font></p>
  <p align="left">February 12, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's Track and Field team split their squad between Boston 
    University's Valentine's Meet and MIT's Coed Invitational for the purpose 
    of pursuing better performances to either end the season or qualify for upcoming 
    championships. Uzoma Orji led the way for MIT, which had 12 season or personal 
    bests, when he threw 62-6 3/4 in the weight throw for an MIT record and to 
    lead the country among division III throwers.</p>
  <p align="left">Orji, just recently adding a toe turn to his weight throw to 
    gain some speed entering his normal turns, got the speed, but not the control 
    as he did one heel turn after the toe turn, had a poor release, but managed 
    over a two foot personal best with his record setting throw. Orji's throw 
    broke the record of 61-6 held by Patrice Parris since 1984.</p>
  <p align="left">Also competing at BU, Ben Schmeckpeper was looking for a new 
    varsity record in the 5000. He settled in with a 70 second pace behind the 
    lead runner but grew impatient even though the pace picked up to 69 second 
    pace. After the mile mark, Schmeckpeper took the lead but soon fell a little 
    off pace, running the second mile in 4:43. Schmeckpeper remained competitive, 
    running 4:45 for the third mile and finishing with a 33 last 200 to record 
    a season best 14:40.66. The performance provisionally qualified him for the 
    NCAA championships in four weeks. Running in a different section of the 5000, 
    Chris Wong ran a great race, only deviating by four seconds from his slowest 
    to fastest 400 en route to a 12 second personal best of 15:30.97.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenny Rosche carried the team's momentum into the 400 as he 
    tried to gain entrance into the fast section of the 400 in next week's New 
    England Division III Championship. Running aggressively for the entire race 
    for the first time this year, Rosche came through the first 200 in 23.4. Getting 
    the lead at the break, Rosche held on to run an indoor personal best of 50.86.</p>
  <p align="left">Jesse Collins made another attempt to better his seed in the 
    500 meter run for next weekend's championship. Running a more even pace than 
    in previous attempts, Collins perhaps waited too long to make his move as 
    he appeared to have a lot left at the finish. Nevertheless, Collins ran a 
    personal best of 1:07.34</p>
  <p align="left">In the shorter one lap race, both Zach Traina and David Blau 
    ran well. Traina, also in the hunt for a varsity record, fell just short of 
    Mark Dunzo's 22.17 with an indoor personal best of 22.31. Traina's result 
    was compromised by the fact that blocks were not allowed in these later sections. 
    Blau got out well and also ran a season best, clocking 22.89 for the 200.</p>
  <p align="left">On Friday night, MIT put together a distance medley relay team 
    in an attempt to qualify for the national championship. Needing a time of 
    10:13.30 on the banked track, Eric Khatchadourian led things off with the 
    1200 leg. Running a smart pace of 61 at the 400, Khatchadourian was already 
    out of the race as the back of the pack was at least 20 meters ahead. With 
    no one to run with, Khatchadourian fell off the pace in the final 400, finishing 
    with a 3:09, four seconds slower than he hoped. Traina received the baton 
    in an effort to get the team back into the race. Despite his 49.2 leg, he 
    was not able to make up much ground on the strong field. Carlos Renjifo, returning 
    to competition after being injured, ran the 800 leg as well as could be expected. 
    Running alone, far behind the pack, Renjifo came through 600 metes in 1:29 
    but fell off the pace in the final 200, finishing in 2:01. Fivos Constantinou 
    anchored the relay with the 1600 leg. Constantinou also tried to make the 
    race competitive, running through splits of 60, 2:04 and 3:09 but was unable 
    to make up any significant ground. Falling off pace in the final 200, Constantinou 
    finished with a 4:17 to give the team a 10:18.30 overall performance. In two 
    weeks, at the All New England Championship, the quartet will make another 
    attempt when they are better rested and more prepared to run fast.</p>
  <p align="left">Next Friday, the pentathletes make the trip to Medford to compete 
    at Tufts University in the New England Division III Championshp. On Saturday, 
    the rest of the qualifiers for MIT will put their best effort forward in an 
    attempt to win the Championship, which they have won three of the past five 
    years.</p>
