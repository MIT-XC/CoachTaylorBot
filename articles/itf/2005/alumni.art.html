  <p><strong><font size="+2">VARSITY RETIRE ALUMNI FOR SIXTH IN A ROW IN ANNUAL 
    MEET</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 8, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">The &quot;Has Beens&quot;, as the track and field alumni are 
    affectionately known, won seven of the fifteen events and were down by one 
    point, 58-59 with two events to go, but could not manage any more points as 
    the varsity scored the final fourteen by sweeping the 5000 and winning the 
    800 relay to close out the meet with a 73-58 victory. The age grading tables 
    did not work at meet time but the scores will be adjusted as necessary.</p>
  <p align="left">In the grueling pentathlon, only Rick Rajter, now an assistant 
    coach for MIT while he works on his Ph.D, chose to enter. Rick easily established 
    a lead by winning the hurdles and never looked back, scoring 3126 to win by 
    over 400 points. Freshmen Chris Desrochers and Omari Stephens placed second 
    and third in their first pentathlons.</p>
  <p align="left">With the field events getting under way first, the alumni hoped 
    to establish a lead to combat their lack of sprint and distance entries. In 
    the weight throw, the expected 1-2 finish of Uzoma Orji and David Saylor for 
    the varsity came to fruition. Only the ageless Bill Singhose saved the alumni 
    from being swept as he managed a 41-10 throw. In the shot put, Uzoma threw 
    53-6 1/2 to win the event as expected. Francisco Cruz switched teams as a 
    first year &quot;has been&quot; and pulled out a second place. Greg Hunter, 
    one who will certainly gain from the age graded tables at 50 years of age, 
    threw an excellent 37-4 to narrowly miss out on third place.</p>
  <p align="left">The alumni swept the high jump as expected with Craig Mielcarz 
    clearing 6-6 and nearly gettting 6-8 1/4. Brian Hoying and Rick Rajter backed 
    that up with jumps of 6-4 and 5-10. In the long jump, Ravi Sastry jumped 20-3 
    1/2 on his last attempt to move into second place, but freshman Matt Clancy 
    tied him on his last attempt and took second place honors because of a better 
    second jump. Senior Nestor Hernandez won the event with a jump of 20-05 1/2. 
    In the triple jump, Rajter came through with his second victory by jumping 
    42-6. Makinde Adeagbo and Anthony Teixeira jumped 41-4 1/4 and 41-3 1/4 respectively 
    to place second and third. Bill Singhose managed a second in the pole vault 
    by clearing 13-0, but the varsity earned first and third when Nate Ball cleared 
    14-6 and Josh Chartier and Hernandez cleared 12-6 to tie for the last scoring 
    position. The score after the pentathlon and field events was varsity 36, 
    alumni 27.</p>
  <p align="left">The running events began with the mile run. Last minute entry, 
    Leif Seed, an alum not heard from since graduation in '99, trailed Fivos Constantinou 
    and Ben Schmeckpeper through splits of 64, 2:11 and 3:16 before taking the 
    lead and finishing in 4:19.64. Fivos and Ben placed second and third with 
    strong performances of 4:21.02 and 4:22.42.</p>
  <p align="left">Returning from the pentathlon, Omari Stephens and Teixeira tried 
    to prevent another alumni sweep in the 55HH, but Rajter, Sastry and Mielcarz 
    denied them any points. Rajter won his third event, running 8.10 and accounting 
    for 16 of his team's points. The overall score was now 41-40 in favor of the 
    alumni.</p>
  <p align="left">The 400 had the possibility of developing into another sweep 
    for the alumni as they loaded the event with Hoying, Matt Lehman, Yuval Mazor 
    and Todd Rosenfield. Fortunately for the varsity, freshman Kenny Rosche decided 
    to shake off any doubts he had about his rehabilitation from ACL surgery last 
    year and took the break, coming through in mid 24 for the first 200. Kenny's 
    technique fell apart in the final lap as Hoying and Lehman moved past him 
    in the final 60 meters. Jesse Collins moved up well at the finish to place 
    right behind Rosche's third place 52.74 in 52.94.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT wiped out the eight point deficit in the next event without 
    having to put forth much of an effort as the alumni had no entries in the 
    55 meter dash. Nevertheless, Zach Traina and company did not take it easy. 
    Traina finished with an excellent early season performance of 6.69 to win 
    the event. David Blau ran a very respectable 6.78 for second and Jonathan 
    Hsieh closed out the scoring with a 6.96.</p>
  <p align="left">Just as the varsity took the lead, the middle distance runners 
    in the 800 had to face Leif Seed again. Fivos again showed no fear, taking 
    the race out in 58 at the quarter and 1:28 at the 600. Leif showed why he 
    was an All America winner in this event as he cruised to the lead and finished 
    in 1:58.29. Fivos finished in an indoor PR of 2:00.16. Sean Montgomery faded 
    in the final 400 but still held on for third place, giving the alumni a two 
    point edge.</p>
  <p align="left">The alumni decided to enter the 200 with force rather than save 
    everyone for the 4x200. Lehman ran a great race, passing Blau for second place 
    right at the finish to run 23.61. Traina earned his second victory with a 
    23.03 despite a horrible start. These results gave the varsity a one point 
    lead going into the 5K and 800 relay, the final two events.</p>
  <p align="left">Right from the start of the 5K it was obvious that Ben Schmeckpeper 
    and Eric Khatchadourian would be the front runners. Starting slowly and bumping 
    the pace up to come through splits of 4:59 and 9:53, Schmeckpeper took control 
    just before the two mile mark with a 71 quarter. Eric held on for second but 
    his pace slowed to 5:14 for the third mile. Nevertheless, he ran a big indoor 
    PR of 15:48.64. Chris Wong ran a great race, negatively splitting the second 
    mile with a 5:05 to take control of third place ahead of alumni, Terry McNatt, 
    who was doubling back from the mile, and Craig Wildman.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina led off the 4x200 for the varsity in order to give 
    them a lead over Mazor and the alumni going into the handoffs. A good handoff 
    to Rosche and a reasonably strong leg kept Hoying at bay. Despite a good handoff 
    to Collins, Lehman made up the two meter gap finishing nearly even at the 
    final handoff. Both teams had poor handoffs, but the varsity carried their 
    speed through the zone a little better, maintaining the inside track. Blau 
    left an exhausted but game Rajter behind to bring the varsity home in first.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT is again at home, hosting teams from Bates College 
    and the Coast Guard Academy at 1:00 on Saturday.</p>
