  <p><strong><font size="+3">ORJI LEADS MIT TO 11TH PLACE FINISH AT NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="+3">Wins NCAA Meet Male Field Athlete of the Meet</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">March 13, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji continued his season long domination of the shot 
    put at the NCAA Division III Championship being held at the University of 
    Wisconsin Whitewater with a personal best of 59-6 1/4, winning the event by 
    over three feet. He backed it up with another personal best in the weight 
    throw, throwing the ball 60-3 3/4 to secure 5th place and a total of 14 points 
    for MIT. His performances as well as his infectious preparations earned him 
    the championship male field athlete of the meet.</p>
  <p align="left">His meet began on Friday with the weight throw. Orji, scheduled 
    to throw first, opened up with a 58-0 1/2 effort. This was a great start and 
    had the MIT coaches and supporters looking forward to a great weekend. However, 
    the next two throwers both threw personal bests and Orji was already in third 
    place. Fortunately, things calmed down a bit and no one else threw further. 
    In the second flight, two others passed Orji, putting him in fifth going into 
    the finals. On his first throw of the finals Orji blasted his PR, moving into 
    fourth position. On his fifth throw, another thrower passed Orji to move him 
    back to fifth. Despite another great effort, this one 58-6, Orji could not 
    move up.</p>
  <p align="left">Later on Friday, Brian Anderson took to the track in the first 
    of his two trials, the 1500. Anderson has been suffering from an injured glute/hamstring 
    and has been unable to train properly for the past five weeks. Nevertheless, 
    Anderson felt ready and appeared confident. Halfway through the race, coming 
    through in a pedestrian 2:09 at the 800, Anderson took the lead and picked 
    up the pace to come through the 1200 in 3:11. In the final 200 he was unable 
    to respond, showing the lack of training, finishing in 3:59.48, missing the 
    finals by one position.</p>
  <p align="left">In the 800 trials Anderson was angry at not making the 1500 
    final and was determined to help MIT score some points. This time, after the 
    first 400 Anderson appeared to want to take the lead, but seemed indecisive, 
    prefering to stay in lane two on the shoulder of the leader. In the final 
    200 Anderson again could not respond, finishing last in his heat with a time 
    of 1:56.78. After last year's third place finish Anderson was obviously disappointed 
    but it was obvious he gave his best and just did not have it that day.</p>
  <p align="left">On Saturday, Orji took to the circle once again. Entering the 
    shot put competition he was ranked first by four inches over two other throwers. 
    One of those throwers was one of three previous national champions in the 
    event. Orji certainly had his work cut out for himself. He opened up with 
    a safety throw of 54-8. On this second throw he blasted a personal best of 
    58-3. On his final throw of the first flight, he fouled, but had secured first 
    place in the flight by well over three feet. In the second flight, the defending 
    national champion could only manage a 55-5 effort even though that was the 
    best in the flight. In the finals, Orji brought a whole new level of energy 
    to the event. Yelling at himself and jumping in the air to get psyched up, 
    the crowd responded and began to cheer loudly for him. He did not disappoint, 
    blasting his 59-6 1/4 much to the delight of the crowd. Orji's mark was a 
    new facility record and missed the national championship record by a mere 
    seven centimeters. From that point on it was Orji's show. The crowd was silent 
    for every other thrower except Orji. On his final two efforts, the entire 
    crowd standing behind the shot area and most of those in the stands began 
    a rhythmic clap in support of Orji's yelling and fired up efforts prior to 
    his throw. The area was rocking with noise, completely drowning out the announcer 
    and support in the neighboring triple jump. Orji went for the 60' barrier 
    and may have had it on his fifth throw if not for a narrow foul. On his final 
    throw, he threw another blast, this one 58-9 1/4 to bring an end to a great 
    competition even though the runner-up threw 56-5 1/4.</p>
