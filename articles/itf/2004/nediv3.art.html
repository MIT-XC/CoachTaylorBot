  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT CLAIMS FOURTH PLACE IN NE DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP</font></strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">February 21, 2004</p>
  <p align="left"> MIT went into the New England Division III Championships, hosted 
    by Bowdoin College, with hopes of securing third place. Significantly below 
    full strength, the Engineers hoped they could have great performances from 
    the few athletes they had competing and hold off Bates College, who was seeded 
    within a few points of MIT. After all the dust cleared, Williams College returned 
    to the champions position with 115.5 points. Tufts had a good meet, putting 
    together 107.5 points. Bates had marvelous performances from their weight 
    throwers and their 600 and 3000 meter runners to exceed their seed and come 
    home with the third place trophy, scoring 84.5 points in the process. MIT 
    also exceeded their seeds, scoring 73 points, but with one event to go realized 
    they could not make up the necessary points and cruised in the 3200 relay 
    to avoid aggravating star the injured glute of middle distance star Brian 
    Anderson.</p>
  <p align="left">On Friday, Marcus Carson and Thad Wozniak participated in the 
    pentathlon. With MIT's normally dominating contingent either graduated or 
    electing to not participate on the team, Wozniak and Carson, both rookies 
    in the event, knew they had to put points on the board. Both started off well 
    in the hurdles and performed well all day. Wozniak placed fourth and Carson 
    sixth, both with season bests of 2735 and 2540 respectively.</p>
  <p align="left">In the first event, the 35 lb. weight throw, Uzoma Orji took 
    care of business with a throw of 57-00 3/4 to win the event. The big surprise 
    was Chris Khan moving from seventh to third on his last throw with a 55-1 
    1/2 for a season best. This is after three weeks of not throwing the implement, 
    even in practice due to an injured back. The shot put brought similar results. 
    Again Orji took care of his part by throwing a meet record of 57-1. Once again, 
    the surprise was Khan moving from fifth to third with a 15 inch personal best 
    of 51-2 1/4 on his final throw. Orji and Khan accounted for 32 points between 
    them, which would have defeated all by eight of the team in New England.</p>
  <p align="left">Josh Chartier and Nate Ball entered the pole vault hoping to 
    add significantly to the Engineers point total. Ball, not having vaulted hard 
    since the alumni meet due to his hamstring pull, could not get the timing 
    down and no heighted. Chartier jumped well at 13-9 but could not clear a PR 
    of 14-3. Chartier claimed sixth place to add three points to MIT's effort.</p>
  <p align="left">On the track, Brian Anderson took his partially injured glute 
    and ran conservatively for the first part of the 1500. Once he picked up the 
    pace he was dogged by a determined runner from Bowdoin. Anderson could not 
    shake him and was unprepared to handle the final kick, losing for the first 
    time this year to a division III athlete. Coach Halston Taylor took the blame 
    for this loss, explaining that it was he who asked Anderson to use the strategy. 
    In the 1000 meters, Anderson did not have to be told to run his race from 
    the front, which he did, winning by nearly two seconds in 2:29.45.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina stepped on the track for the first time in three 
    weeks, in fact the same track where he pulled his hamstring on January 31. 
    Against his better judgment, Coach Taylor allowed Traina to run the 200, an 
    event in which Traina was seeded eighth. Not only did Traina make the finals 
    but he set a personal indoor best of 22.50 to post the fastest time in the 
    trials. It was obvious that his endurance was not there as he slowed significantly 
    in the final 30 meters. In the finals, Traina again got out well and again 
    fatigued on the final straight. Nevertheless, his 22.61 was good enough for 
    third place and an unexpected six points.</p>
  <p align="left">Ben Schmeckpeper had a difficult decision to make when deciding 
    which race to enter, the 3000 or the 5000. Needing a faster 5000 time to guarantee 
    entrance in the All Division New England Championship next weekend, and thus 
    another shot at nationals, Schmeckpeper decided on that race rather than the 
    3000 where he had the fastest seed time. The 3000 may have garnered more points 
    for MIT but would have been a dead end since that distance is not run at the 
    NCAA Championships in division III. The pace was quick and Schmeckpeper was 
    right with the leaders through two miles in 9:31. The leader and eventual 
    winner of the race, Nate Brigham from Tufts, decided he no longer wanted the 
    lead and slowed to 78 second pace trying to force someone in the lead. Eventually 
    another runner took the lead with less than a mile to go. With three quarters 
    of a mile to go, Schmeckpeper took the lead but did not put the runners away. 
    When the others kicked, Schmeckpeper could not go with them, settling for 
    a very respectable fourth place finish in a personal best of 14:51.96.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT had just enough bodies to put together two relays, the distance 
    medley and the 3200. In the DMR, Chris Fidkowski ran his second track race 
    ever and produced a respectable 3:14 1200 meter opening leg. Wozniak came 
    back from his pentathlon effort and provided a 52.7 leg to move MIT up to 
    sixth place. Eric Khatchadourian ran a very fine 2:02.8 leg and had MIT in 
    the back of a pack running for fifth place. Carlos Renjifo got caught up in 
    the excitement and went out a little too fast, posting splits of 31 and 62 
    seconds for the first 200 and 400. This pace took its toll, causing Renjifo 
    to settle for a survival pace, holding on for 8th with a 4:26 split. It was 
    a loaded field as MIT ran a season best by 22 seconds and still only got one 
    point out of it.</p>
  <p align="left">Bates College needed at least three points in the 1600 relay 
    to make it mathematically impossible for MIT to catch them and three points 
    is exactly what they got. Coach Taylor told Anderson, the anchor, to not risk 
    further injury and to take it easy unless it was obvious MIT could win the 
    event. MIT ran great splits but not good enough to put Anderson in contention. 
    Jesse Collins moved up from the 600 distance to record a 2:02.9 leg. Fivos 
    Constantinous, battled an injured abdominal muscle to run a season best of 
    2:00.8. Imran Hendley also ran a season best, but his 2:03.9 put him far behind 
    the first three teams in the race. Anderson could have run a sub 2:00 800 
    to get the team to fourth place in the race, but the additional points would 
    not help the cause so Anderson jogged in a 2:11 to save his body for nationals.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, Traina, Anderson, Schmeckpeper, Orji, Khan and possibly 
    the Ball and Chartier will compete at the All New Englands held at Boston 
    University on Friday night and Saturday afternoon.</p>
