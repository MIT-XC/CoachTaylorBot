  <p><strong><font size="+3">ORJI CARRIES THROWS DOMINATION AT ALL NEW ENGLANDS 
    WITH WINS IN SHOT AND WEIGHT</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 28, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">MIT Men's track and field team took six athletes to the All 
    Division New England Championships and came away with an 11th place finish 
    and the top Division III finish in the meet. Leading the way for the Engineers 
    was Uzoma Orji. Orji, who won the Shot Put and Weight Throw last week at the 
    New England Division III Championship, came away with the same results against 
    the Division I competition in New England, scoring 20 of MIT's 23 points.</p>
  <p align="left">In the 35lb. Weight Throw, Orji was in fifth going into the 
    last round of the finals. With a throw of 58-5 3/4 he moved to first place 
    and was able to hold it for MIT's first points. In the Shot Put, Orji threw 
    57-3 1/2 on his first throw and that was enough for the win. MIT has not had 
    a double winner in this meet in recent history, if ever. Chris Khan, throwing 
    with both a back and toe injury in hopes of making the NCAA Division III Championship, 
    managed to place eighth in the Shot Put with a throw of 49-3 1/2.</p>
  <p align="left">On the track, Brian Anderson wanted to try the double of the 
    Mile Run and 800. The trials and finals of both are setup the same as they 
    are at the NCAA Division III Championships in two weeks. This would give Anderson 
    a feel for what that would be like if he decided to pursue both races. Unfortunately 
    he developed a cold after the entries were in, committing him to the double. 
    In Friday's trials, Anderson showed no signs of the illness as he ran just 
    hard enough in both the mile (4:14.41) and 800 (1:53.73) to qualify for the 
    finals on Saturday. In the mile, Anderson looked good through 800 meters then 
    seemed to totally give up as he faded to last, which is where he finished. 
    It appears he let his physical problems affect his mental preparation in a 
    negative way. Anderson got his act together in the 800 as he ran a good race 
    even though the leaders went out in a furious pace. Anderson stayed in the 
    back even with splits of 54 and 1:22. The top four finishers were all under 
    1:50 and Anderson finished in eighth with a 1:53.19.</p>
  <p align="left">Ben Schmeckpeper also scored a point, placing eighth in the 
    5000 with a new personal best of 14:39.81. Schmeckpeper stayed with the main 
    pack through mile splits of 4:40 and 9:20 before slowing slightly in the third 
    mile, coming through in 14:06. Even as tired as he was, he managed to close 
    with a 33 final 200 to give himself a 12 second PR. Schmeckpeper's performance 
    ranks him 13th among Division III runners nationally, which is not likely 
    good enough to get him to nationals but did move him to third on the MIT top 
    ten list for that event.</p>
  <p align="left">Not placing, but running personal bests in the 200 were Zach 
    Traina and David Blau. Traina ran 22.38, one position out of making the finals 
    and Blau ran 22.78, moving him into fourth on the all-time MIT indoor list.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, Orji and Khan will throw at the IC4A championship 
    being held at BU on Saturday and Sunday. Anderson, who has qualified in the 
    800, 1000 and 1500 may run one of those or may take the weekend off to rest 
    up for nationals. Schmeckpeper, who has also qualified for this prestigious 
    meet, may try to improve his chances for making nationals by running the 5000. 
    Nate Ball and Josh Chartier will try to make a national mark in the Pole Vault 
    up at Bowdoin College in the ECAC Division III Championship.</p>
