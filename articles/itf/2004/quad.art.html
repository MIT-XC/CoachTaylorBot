  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT Loses For First Time Since 2001 - to Williams</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 24, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">The lack of depth, and holes in events caused by a few athletes 
    who elected not to participate this season for varioius reasons, finally caught 
    up with the Engineers from MIT. Host Williams College handed MIT its first 
    defeat since the Ephs themselves narrowly defeated them in 2001. With the 
    traditional eight place scoring system (9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1) Williams finished 
    with 225.5 to MIT's 176, RPI's 155 and Westfield State's 33.5.</p>
  <p align="left">The athletes from MIT were realistic enough to be prepared for 
    the possible loss, without allowing it to distract them from competing hard 
    and achieving top performances. This was evident in many areas as the championship 
    level athletes began, or continued to show their dominance. The best indoor 
    throwing double ever for an MIT athlete and possibly any New England Division 
    III athlete was had by sophomore Uzoma Orji. Orji blasted his second effort 
    in the weight throw to a distance of 59-2 1/4, tying him for 5th with John-Paul 
    Clarke on the MIT all-time best list and moving into the second place on the 
    NCAA Division III ranking list. In the shot put, Orji sent the shot on a trip 
    55-11 3/4 away, further increasing his MIT record and his nation leading distance 
    among Division III throwers.</p>
  <p align="left">Chris Khan gave exceptional support in the throws, particularly 
    since his back is still not well, cutting his practice time significantly. 
    Khan threw a season best 55-1 in the weight for second place and heaved the 
    shot 46-11 for third place in that event. If Khan's back heals in time, the 
    possibility of having two 60' weight throwers and 50' shot putters on the 
    team at the same time could bode well in the championships.</p>
  <p align="left">Brian Anderson remained undefeated by winning the 1500 and 800 
    once again. Anderson expected stiff competition from All America runner Matt 
    Winkler of Williams, but Winkler was injured and unable to race. Anderson 
    led from start to finish in the 1500, backing off a very fast pace with 400 
    to go and a 50 meter lead. Nevertheless, he ran 4:00.34. In the 800, Anderson 
    received some unexpected help for the first 400 meters from an opposing Williams 
    runner before taking matters into his own hands for the second half of the 
    race. Anderson ran 1:56.74 on the short track.</p>
  <p align="left">Ben Schmeckpeper returned to his winning ways after a bad race 
    last week at Bates College. Schmeckpeper took the lead at the gun and pressed 
    the pace. He was passed at the bell, but regained the lead coming off the 
    final turn in a monstrous kick, finishing in 8:40.41. Numerous other personal 
    bests were run by the Engineers in the 3000. Eric Khatchadourian placed third 
    with a well run 8:58.56. Kevin DiGenova continued his weekly improvement with 
    a 9:22.43 after a fast closing quarter. Kevin Brulois showed he is becoming 
    accustomed to racing around the indoor oval as he placed 7th in 9:24.66. Ian 
    Driver also ran a PR of 9:24.99 and would have placed eighth but was MIT's 
    firth runner and the rules only permitted four placers per team per event.</p>
  <p align="left">Many other Engineers set personal bests. Freshmen Marcus Carson 
    and Bo Feng both set huge personal bests in the 55HH. Carson, whose best had 
    been 8.92, ran a 8.58 in the trials and 8.59 in the finals to place 5th. Feng 
    improved to 8.69 to place 7th. Carson also ran 6.90 in the 55 dash trials 
    for his best this season.</p>
  <p align="left">Perhaps the most significant personal bests were had by Nestor 
    Hernandez. In the long jump, Hernandez improved is indoor best by over a foot 
    with two 22' efforts, the best being 22-0 3/4 for second place. Hernandez 
    was not done. In the pole vault he cleared 13-7 1/4 for another 2nd place. 
    Josh Chartier claimed fifth place and an indoor best in the vault with a clear 
    at 13-1 1/2.</p>
  <p align="left">Thad Wozniak had a good day at the track so to speak. He started 
    with a best in the high jump at 5-5 3/4, added a third place personal best 
    in the 400 at 53.11 on the small track and added a seventh place in the 200 
    at 24.28. Wozniak also long jumped and added a key lead off leg to the victorious 
    4x400 relay.</p>
  <p align="left">Overall, the team showed a much improved competitive effort 
    this week. Team support was up a little but still not at the level necessary 
    to bring out the best performances in each other. As the season approaches 
    the half-way point it is obvious the this MIT team has more potential than 
    they have displayed. The question is if they will put it together in time 
    for the championships.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT completes their regular season scoring meets 
    by taking their 4-1 record to Bowdoin College to go up against rivals Bowdoin 
    and Tufts University.</p>
