    WIN OVER TUFTS IN 5-WAY MEET</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 27, 2007</p>
  <p align="left">MIT coaches expected a let down in performances after last
    week's exciting win over Williams College but the team would have none of
    it as they remained undefeated after a win over <a href="bowdoin.res.html">Tufts,
    Bowdoin, Springfield and Colby</a> to move their record to 9-0.&nbsp; Some
    of the Tufts runners attended a meet at Boston University in hopes to run
    faster times on the banked track, but it may not have made a difference as
    the Engineers came away with a 46 point victory with a total of 185.5 points
    to 139.5 for Tufts.&nbsp; Springfield
    followed with 119 points, followed by 75 for host Bowdoin and 35 for Colby.</p>
  <p align="left">The horizontal jumpers came into the competition trailing the
    Tufts jumpers in the New England rankings.&nbsp; The quickly improving jumpers
    were ready for the challenge as demonstrated by a 2-3-4 finish in the long
    jump, led by Chris Bateman's 21-5 1/4, and a 2-4-5-6 placing in the triple
    jump led by Stephen Morton's freshman record of 45-4 1/4.&nbsp; With only
    six places scoring and a scoring system of 10-8-6-4-2-1, it was paramount
    to get high places as well as a majority of all six scoring places so the
    Engineers could make up for a lack of points in the weight throw and high
    jump.</p>
  <p align="left">The distance runners were not to be outdone.&nbsp; Also improving
    each week, the &quot;distance dudes&quot; took advantage of this meet having both the
    3000 and 5000 meter races.&nbsp; In the 3000, Joe Roy-Mayhew led Tech to
    a 2-5-6 finish with a new personal best of 8:44.93.&nbsp; In the 5000, Dave
    Sorenson of Tufts went out hard, opening up a 15 second lead on the field,
    including MIT freshmen, Johannes Schneider and Hemagiri Arumugam.&nbsp; At
    the 3200 meter mark, Schneider began closing the gap, negatively splitting
    a final mile in 4:50.&nbsp; With one lap to go Schneider went to go around
    Sorenson, who was stepping out himself to go around a lapped group of runners.&nbsp; Schneider
    did not allow sufficient room and ended up on the losing end of contact with
    150 meters to go.&nbsp; Although he did not win, Schneider ran a superb 15:21.77
    to lead a 2-3-4-5 domination of the 5K by MIT.</p>
  <p align="left">The pole vault was certainly not lacking an MIT presence.&nbsp; Despite
    a no-height performance by Greg Tao due to his pole being broken early in
    the competition by Cody Rebholz (tied for 6th), Omari Stephens led the remaining
    Tech vaulters to a 1-2-3  placing with a personal best 14-9 effort.</p>
  <p align="left">Despite being a little ill, Jake Ruzevick dominated the mile
    run wire to wire with a 4:20.46 time before calling it quits for the day.&nbsp; Also
    in the mile, Yermie Cohen had his best MIT meet to this point, leading all
    scorers with 18.5 points.&nbsp; Cohen
    earned a third in the mile with an indoor PR of 4:26.00, won the 1000 in
    2:36.22 and ran a 2:02.8 leg on the winning 4x800 relay.&nbsp; Following
    Cohen to the line in the 1000 was Bill Phipps, just .04 behind for second
    place. </p>
  <p align="left">Although he was recovering from an illness earlier in the week,
    Liam Fedus ran to a personal best in the 600 to move to number five on the
    MIT all-time 600 list.&nbsp; Fedus also struggled through a leg in the 200
    and the 4x400 but was happy when the day was done.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's next meet is on Monday, February 5 at Boston University
    vs. Boston University, Boston College, Northeastern and Providence College,
    all division I colleges.</p>
