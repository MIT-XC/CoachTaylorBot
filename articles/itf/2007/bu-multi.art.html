  <p><strong><span class="style1">MIT'S PERFORMANCE DOMINATED
    BY PERSONAL BESTS</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 5, 2007</p>
  <p align="left">Being the only Division III team in a meet comprised of Division
    I colleges can be a little intimidating.&nbsp; However, MIT has a tradition
    of taking care of business when they go to a track meet, regardless of the
    opponents, and the Engineers were not about to change now.&nbsp; Twenty-three
    personal bests later the tech men showed they are ready for the upcoming
    championships. </p>
  <p align="left">In the first event, Jake Ruzevick ran a well paced 4:15.62
    mile run to smash his previous best and move into the all-time top 10 indoor
    list by MIT track athletes.&nbsp; Despite the contact and a couple of strategic
    errors Ruzevick managed to hold it together and run a time that missed the
    NCAA provisional qualifying mark by .02.&nbsp; In the second section of the
    mile, Yermie Cohen ran 4:22.75 for the win. </p>
  <p align="left">In the 500, all three MIT entrants, Matt Bieniosek, Aron Walker
    and Will Gibson, ran personal bests.&nbsp; Bieniosek and Walker both improved
    their New England Division III qualifying times with 1:07.55 and 1:08.15
    respectively.&nbsp; Gibson did not qualify but ran an excellent 1:10.07.</p>
  <p align="left">Peter Mulligan continues to improve each week, this time with
    a 2:01.33 to put himself in position to run a relay in the upcoming Division
    III Championship.</p>
  <p align="left">Cohen came back in the 1000 to set yet another PR.&nbsp; Going
    out a little too quickly, he nevertheless held on for a 2:34.14 performance.&nbsp; Cohen
    is qualified for both the mile and 1000 for the NE Division III Championships.&nbsp; Archi
    Stuk also ran a 1000 best of 2:38.55. </p>
  <p align="left">Joe Roy-Mayhew went with the leaders from Providence College
    at the start of the race, determined to come through the mile in 4:32.&nbsp; He
    came very close by hitting the mile mark in 4:33.&nbsp; Roy-Mayhew faded
    a little at the end but still managed a nice PR for third place in 8:40.15.&nbsp; Hemugiri
    Arumugam lowered his personal best to 8:50.74 as he prepares for the upcoming
    championship.&nbsp; Others setting bests were Brian Jacokes in 9:00.92, Rocco
    Repetski in 9:06.69 and Kevin DiGenova in 9:07.76. </p>
  <p align="left">Stephen Morton continued to show off his talents when he again
    lowered the freshman 200 record, this time running 22.57, good for second
    place.&nbsp; Also
    setting a nice personal best in the one lapper was Stephen Oney, clocking
    a 23.34.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">Morton
    also did well in the triple jump, bounding 44-9 3/4 for second place.&nbsp; MIT
    also dominated places 3-7 in the triple jump with outstanding personal bests
    from Anthony Teixeira (44-2 1/2) and Obinna Anyanwu (43-10 3/4) showcasing
    MIT's improvement in this event.</p>
  <p align="left">In the pole vault, Omari Stephens claimed a second place and
    a personal best of 14-11, just missing 15-6.&nbsp; Not to be outdone, Greg
    Tao cleared 13-11 1/4 for his own MIT PR.</p>
  <p align="left">This upcoming weekend, MIT will send many of their faster runners
    back to BU for the Valentine's Classic with the men competing on Friday and
    the women on Saturday.&nbsp; The
    field event athletes as well as some runners who have qualified in one event
    but are running a shorter one for speed and those trying to qualify for the
    championship will be competing at the MIT Coed Invitational on Saturday. </p>
