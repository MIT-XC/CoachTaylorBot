  <p><strong><span class="style1">MIT ATHLETES CONTINUE TO DOMINATE
    WITH PERSONAL BESTS</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 10, 2007</p>
  <p align="left">While some of their teammates competed at Boston University
    to take advantage of the banked track, many MIT track and field members stayed
    home at their own <a href="coed.res.html">Coed Invitational</a> to face very good competition from 13
    New England colleges in a meet much shorter in duration that the two-day
    marathon across the river.</p>
  <p align="left">The only athlete to compete in both was James Oleinik.&nbsp; Setting
    a season best the night before at BU, Oleinik threw a personal best of 49-7
    to win the shot put competition at MIT.</p>
  <p align="left">Anthony Teixeira had a very fine day of competition, setting
    two personal bests.&nbsp; In the high hurdles, Teixeira sprinted to a 8.04
    victory and then came back to the long jump to leap 21-5 1/4 to place third,
    just ahead of teammates Chris Bateman and Stephen Morton who both jumped
    21-4 1/4.</p>
  <p align="left">Brian Jacokes led a group of MIT distance runners in the 5000
    in an effort to qualify for the New England Division III Championship next
    weekend.&nbsp; Jacokes negative split the final mile and ran a 34 final 200
    to finish in 15:41.83 but missed qualifying by 1.83 seconds.&nbsp; Jacokes
    nevertheless ran another huge PR and won the event.&nbsp; Trevor Rundell
    showed he is coming back well from injury as he ran 16:00.15.</p>
  <p align="left">Althought the vaulters dominated the event as usual, Patrick
    Barragan had the only personal best.&nbsp; Barragan vaulted to 13-3 for a
    fourth place finish.</p>
  <p align="left">Other fine performances turned in were Will Gibson's PR of
    1:28.34 in the 600, Chris Wong, Jack Bourbonnais and Rocco Repetski in the
    mile running 4:30.52, 4:31.80 and 4:35.42 respectively, Eric Beecher with
    a season best of 5-11 1/4 in the high jump and Jonathan Hsieh's season best
    of 6.84 in the 55 dash.</p>
  <p align="left">About half of the team will travel north to Bates College to
    compete in the New England Division III Championship next Saturday.</p>
