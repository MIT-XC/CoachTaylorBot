    IN NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 17, 2007</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's Men's Indoor Track and Field team entered the <a href="ned3.res.html">New
      England Division III Championship</a> hosted by Bates College as the fourth
      seed behind Williams College, Tufts University and Springfield College
      with Bates close behind.&nbsp; Nine personal bests later the Engineers
      scored 12 more points than they were seeded for, easily finishing ahead
      of Springfield for third place with 79 points behind Williams with 152
      and Tufts with 103, continuing to give MIT the most top three finishes
      in the meet's history. </p>
  <p align="left">Most of MIT's points were supposed to come at the end of the
    meet, but the long jumpers and pole vaulters did not feel like waiting to
    put MIT on the scoreboard.&nbsp; Seeded to only place fifth, Tech's jumpers
    stepped it up and finished 4-5-8 with captain Chris Bateman leading the way
    with a personal best of 21-8 3/4.&nbsp; Stephen Morton was right behind with
    21-7 1/4 and Anthony Teixeira finishing up with 21-0 3/4.</p>
  <p align="left">Omari Stephens led the vault trio to outscore their seeds by
    one point.&nbsp; Stephens himself placed third with a 14-5 1/2, one place
    lower than his seed, but Greg Tao vaulted to a personal best of 14-2 3/4
    to place fourth and Patrick Barragan tied for sixth with a vault of 12-11
    3/4.</p>
  <p align="left">With 23 points after the two events MIT started the meet well.&nbsp; On
    the track, Teixeira and Stephens both made the finals in the 55HH and then
    proceeded to run personal bests in the finals to place 4th and 6th respectively.&nbsp; Teixeira
    ran 7.92 despite hitting the first three hurdles and Stephens ran 8.06.</p>
  <p align="left">In the shot put, James Oleinik was seeded second and despite
    throwing very near his best he had to settle for fifth with a toss of 48-10
    3/4.</p>
  <p align="left">Entering the second half of the meet, MIT was in sixth place
    but confident their points would come.&nbsp; Matt Bieniosek took to the track
    in the 800 seeded 6th based on his 1:57.09 run at Boston University the week
    before.&nbsp; Running a very slow second 200, Bieniosek was forced to run
    everyone else's race.&nbsp; He could not respond at the end, finishing seventh
    in 1:58.83.</p>
  <p align="left">Jake Ruzevick was seeded fourth in the 1000 but exceeded that
    when he finished with a strong final 200 to run a personal best of 2:31.12
    to place third.</p>
  <p align="left">Freshman Stephen Morton, having to deal with the very strange
    rulings of the games committee as well as an unfortunate random lane assignment,
    nevertheless stayed focused and finished second overall with a flat track
    personal best of 22.58.&nbsp; In the trials, Morton was only one of two runners
    out of 26 to get assigned lane two, the slowest of the five lanes used.&nbsp; Four
    of the six heats only had four to a heat, using the outside lanes for faster
    times.&nbsp; Clearly Morton was at a disadvantage with the inside lane, but
    instead of re-seeding to eliminate anyone from having to run in lane two,
    the games committee decided to run the 200 as is.&nbsp; In addition, they
    decided to advance everyone only on time rather than follow the NCAA rules
    of giving heat winners preference and a higher rank when assigning lanes
    for the final.&nbsp; This
    prevented one heat winner from even advancing and gave Morton lane three
    in the slower of the two section final.&nbsp; Morton took matters into his
    own hands, pushed the first turn to make up the stagger on lane four, and
    brought it home to win his section and beat everyone but the winner in the
    first section. </p>
  <p align="left">Joe Roy-Mayhew, seeded fifth in the 3000, struggled in the
    latter stages of the race and was unable to stay with the leaders.&nbsp; Fading
    to seventh in the final half mile, Roy-Mayhew ran 8:54.07.</p>
  <p align="left">The final field event, the triple jump was about to enter the
    final rounds with both Morton and Bateman making the finals.&nbsp; Despite
    a personal best of 43-11 1/4, Bateman was unable to move up past ninth position.&nbsp; Morton
    was in fifth coming out of the trials but fell to sixth in the final round.&nbsp; With
    his last jump, Morton jumped to a personal best of 45-10 1/2 to improve his
    freshman record and place third for a total day's work of 18 points.</p>
  <p align="left">With only the relays to go MIT only needed to score two points
    if Springfield won the 4x400 relay.&nbsp; MIT put that matter to rest when
    the DMR took to the track.&nbsp; Yermie Cohen did not run as well as he expected
    but he still put MIT in good position with a 3:13 1200 leg.&nbsp; Alex Rothberg
    brought the 400 leg in a fine 51.5 to put MIT in a close third.&nbsp; Archi
    Stuk ran an even paced 2:01.9 800 to put MIT even at the handoff.&nbsp; Hemagiri
    Arumugam followed the leaders for the first 800 meters, but when the pace
    slowed to 2:13 he took matters into his own hands and ran away with the race,
    finishing with a 4:25 and a four second lead over second place.</p>
  <p align="left">In the final event, the 4x800 relay, MIT led from wire to wire
    to win in 7:56.63.&nbsp; Bill Phipps took the lead and ran a 1:59.1 first
    leg.&nbsp; Ruzevick took the pace out hard, coming through the 400 in 56.5
    to open up a 40 meter lead.&nbsp; Ruzevick finished in 1:57.5 to give Peter
    Mulligan a comfortable cushion.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Mulligan put any thoughts
    of their competitors catching up out of their minds by taking it out in 57.4.&nbsp; Mulligan
    finished in 2:01.6 to give anchor, Bieniosek, a thirty meter lead.&nbsp; A
    determined Bieniosek heard the crowd cheering for the closing Brandeis runner
    and ran a 56.9 opening 400.&nbsp; The Brandeis runners closed the gap down
    by at least 20 meters despite the fast pace.&nbsp; Bieniosek continued to
    push the pace coming through 600 in 1:26.8, which was too much for the Brandeis
    runners who eventually faded to finish six seconds behind the MIT championship
    team.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT goes back across the Charles River to compete
    at Boston University, host of the NEICAAA Championship.&nbsp; This meet is
    essentially the New England&nbsp; combined championship for divisions I,
    II and III.</p>
