  <p><strong><font size="4">ANDERSON SETS VARSITY RECORD IN FINAL TUNE-UP FOR 
    NATIONALS</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">March 11, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">Brian Anderson led the few competing Engineers from MIT at the 
    IC4A Championship held at the Boston University track. MIT placed 46th in 
    this very prestigious meet, due entirely to Anderson's 7th place finish in 
    the 1000 meter run.</p>
  <p align="left">Scheduled to compete, but choosing to allow minor injuries to 
    heal were high jumper Craig Mielcarz and shot putter Uzoma Orji. Chris Khan 
    competed in the weight throw and placed 13th with a throw of 55-7.</p>
  <p align="left">Anderson set the MIT varsity record in the trials of the 1000 
    meter run as he ran in the lead for most of the race, finishing with the 3rd 
    fastest time in all the trials with 2:26.38. In the finals, the race went 
    out too slow and Anderson was not prepared for the necessary strategy. His 
    trial time would have won the final as it was won in 2:26.58. Anderson finished 
    in 7th with a time of 2:27.84.</p>
  <p align="left">Competing over at Tufts University in the ECAC Championship 
    in the weight throw was David Saylor. MIT qualified most of their team for 
    the ECAC meet, but chose to prepare those not going on to nationals for the 
    upcoming outdoor season. Saylor was not able to improve his NCAA provisional 
    mark, thus causing him to miss the national championship.</p>
  <p align="left">Anderson, Khan, Mielcarz and Orji will head to DePauw University 
    on the 13th to compete in the NCAA Division III Championship.</p>
