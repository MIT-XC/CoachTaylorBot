  <p><strong><font size="4">MIT WINS QUAD MEET TO MOVE 1 STEP CLOSER TO UNDEFEATED 
    SEASON</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 25, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">Beating Williams College, the team that prevented many MIT undefeated 
    seasons in the 90s, for the second consecutive year, has put MIT one meet 
    away from having their second undefeated season in succession. Led by seven 
    victories in the seventeen events, MIT scored 238 points to Williams' 164.5, 
    RPI's 147.5 and 36 for Westfield State.</p>
  <p align="left">Five minutes into the meet, an excess of steam in the Zamboni 
    room on the bottom floor of the Johnson Athletic Center, set off the fire 
    alarm, causing a 20 minute delay. After an additional 10 minute warmup for 
    those in the current field events, the meet got back underway. </p>
  <p align="left">The delay did not seem to hurt the Engineers from MIT as they 
    scored 92 points in the 6 field events. The scoring for a quadrangular meet 
    under the NCAA rules is 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 for the top 8 places. Meet rules allowed 
    a team to score up to 4 places in a given event, or a maximum of 27 points. 
    Leading the way was a sweep in the high jump. Craig Mielcarz won on misses 
    over teammate Brian Hoying in a modest 6-5. Setting season bests for 3rd and 
    4th were Rick Rajter and Austin Neudecker respectively at 6-3 1/2.</p>
  <p align="left">Also claiming field event victories were Nate Ball in the pole 
    vault and Uzoma Orji in the shot put. Ball qualified provisionally for nationals 
    with an indoor PR of 15-5. Orji won the battle of the number 1 and 2 shot 
    putters in NCAA Division III with a toss of 53-6 3/4.</p>
  <p align="left">Numerous personal and season bests were experienced by the runners 
    from MIT. In the 55 dash, Zach Traina and David Blau both ran personal bests, 
    running 6.64 and 6.67 respectively as they placed 2nd and 3rd. The duo led 
    the way in the 200 as well with Traina setting a PR of 22.93 in a winning 
    effort. Blau placed 4th with his PR of 23.70. Also running personal bests 
    were Tom Hoover and Thad Wozniak, placing 6th and 8th with times of 23.79 
    and 23.97.</p>
  <p align="left">In the middle distance and distance events, Brian Anderson ran 
    two season bests, placing 2nd in the mile with a 4:16.88 and then coming back 
    an hour later and running 2:33.10 in the 1000 for a victory. Ben Schmeckpeper 
    led a trio of personal bests in the 5000. Schmeckpeper led wire to wire with 
    a flat track best of 15:00.94. Lending support were Craig Wildman in 3rd with 
    a 15:37.84 and Ian Driver in 6th with a 16:12.06.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT faces their toughest challenge of the season 
    when they travel to Bowdoin to face the Polar Bears along with very good teams 
    from Springfield College and Tufts University. Bowdoin has one of the best 
    distance squads in the country and Springfield is strong in the shorter distances 
    and field events. Tufts has everything and will probably be the team to beat.</p>
