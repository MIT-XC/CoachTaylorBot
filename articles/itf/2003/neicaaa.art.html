  <p><strong><font size="4">ANDERSON QUALIFIES FOR NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP IN 800</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="4">Orji Adds to his Freshman Weight Throw Record</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">March 1, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">MIT Men's Track and Field team, fresh off the New England Division 
    III Championship title, decided to start outdoor practice early for most of 
    the qualifiers for the All Division New England Championship being held at 
    Boston University this weekend. The few who participated scored 18 points, 
    good enough for 12th place among New England's division I, II and III Institutions.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji, added to the 35 lb. weight throw freshman record 
    with a throw of 52-10. While he did not score in the weight throw, he placed 
    3rd in his specialty, the shot put, with a throw of 52-3 1/4. Orji seemed 
    prepared to throw a big one in the shot, but he was not able to get anything 
    out of his power leg on the release.</p>
  <p align="left">Also in the weight throw, Chris Khan placed 6th with a throw 
    of 55-11 1/4. On his 4th throw, Khan hit his position perfectly and the ball 
    flew over 60'. As we all erupted in cheers, Khan got pulled out of the front 
    of the circle by a toe, fouling the throw.</p>
  <p align="left">In the high jump, Craig Mielcarz could not adjust to the surface 
    and his unusually fresh legs. Although he never found his rhythm, he did manage 
    6' 7 to place 4th.</p>
  <p align="left">Neither Zach Traina nor David Blau placed in the 200, but they 
    both had big personal bests. Traina proved he belonged among the best 200 
    runners by running 22.53 on the BU oval, missing the finals by one person. 
    Blau ran 22.95, tying Traina's freshman record from last year.</p>
  <p align="left">Brian Anderson, ran the 800 fresh for the first time this year, 
    qualifying for the NCAA Division III Championship in two weeks. Anderson took 
    the lead in the trials heat, running splits of 27, 55 and 1:23 before finishing 
    in 1:52.07, the 2nd fastest time in MIT history. In the finals, Anderson made 
    the technical error of cutting his momentum a couple of times, making all 
    the more difficult for his already tired legs. Nevertheless, his final time 
    of 1:52.89 was good enough for 5th place.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, Anderson will run the 1000 at the IC4A Championship 
    being hosted at BU. Khan, Mielcarz, and Orji will also compete at the IC4As 
    in their specialties as they make final preparations for the NCAA Championships.</p>
