<br>

</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT Men's Track and Field Team traveled to Bates College this past

Saturday to finish their regular season. MIT won the meet with 246 1/2 points to Bates

College's 183 1/2, Bowdoin College's 132, and Norwich University's 22. </font></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The last of the Quad Cup Meets would determine the final place of teams

in the league. Going into the meet MIT was 8-1. All other teams had at least 2 losses

except Williams, who beat MIT by 1 point, 2 weeks earlier. For three out of the four years

that the Quad Cup has been in existence, MIT finished 2nd to Williams with 1 loss.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Tech did not look particularly good in their performances. Perhaps

having already defeated Bates the week before prevented the team from responding as well

as Coach Halston Taylor would have liked. &quot;At this time of the season you would like

to think that the team is preparing for the championships both physically and mentally.

While there were some good performances, the guys we will need to count on in the Division

III Championships in two weeks, did not perform to the level expected.&quot;</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Right from the start the meet was never in question as the Engineers 22

points in the Long Jump, and 23 in the High Jump. Even though Tech only scored 13 in the

Mile, the 22 in the High Hurdles, and 21 in the 55 Meter Dash put the meet away almost as

soon as it got started. In fact, the coaches pulled Morio Alexander 'G from the Triple

Jump and allowed only one effort in the Long Jump (good for 2nd place). Dan Helgesen '97

was ailing and he did not compete at all. MIT totally backed off in the relays, not

competing a Distance Medley Relay and giving some others an opportunity to run in the 1600

Meter Relay.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT only won 6 events, with Matt Sandholm '97 the only double winner (55

Meter 6.69, 200 Meter 23.27).</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The Engineers are at home next week, hosting the Quad Cup Invitational,

a non-scoring meet where Quad Cup Teams will try to better their performances in order to

make the Championship standards.</font> </p>
