<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="5">ALUMNI OVERWHELM VARSITY<br>

</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The Alumni showed up in unexpected force (24 members) to overwhelm the

varsity 66 to 56 this past Saturday. Once again Bill Singhose '90 led the way both in

points (21) and rounding up the best Alumni Team yet.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The meet began as usual with a very exciting 35 lb. Weight Throw. John

Wallberg 'G, returned from his internship on Wednesday and wasted no time qualifying for

Nationals with a throw of 53-7 3/4 on his last effort to surpass his former coach

John-Paul Clarke '91. Chris Masalsky '91 showed that you do not need to practice to throw

your best as he threw 48-11 1/4 for 3rd place.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The Long Jump was less eventful as Bill easily outdistanced the field

with a 22-5 1/4 effort. Morio Alexander 'G had a indoor personal best with 21-0 for

second. Kevin Scannell '91 was a little off his best, but still got third with a jump of

20-9.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The High Jump could have been a sweep for the Alumni, but Singhose

decided to take it easy on the Varsity and let Andy Ugarov '95, and James Kirtley '94 take

1st and 2nd respectively with jumps of 6-2 and 6-0. Fresh off the injured list, Ravi

Sastry '98 placed third with 5-10.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The Shot Put was hotly contested right to the end when Singhose threw a

&quot;huge&quot; personal best of 46-5 3/4 to surpass Chris Masalsky's personal best of

45-10 1/2. Wallberg re-discovered his technique on his 5th throw to pass Clarke for third.</font>

</p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Scannell showed his former form by winning the Triple Jump with a leap

of 45-5. He was followed closely by Singhose with 44-4. Alexander again prevented an

Alumni sweep with a jump of 42-0 1/4.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the Pole Vault, the matchup between Singhose and Dafe Ogagan '97

never materialized due to Ogagan being injured and Singhose pulling a hamstring in the

early part of the 400 meters. Fortunately for Bill he had at least gotten in a successful

attempt at 13-0 to secure 2nd place. First place was garnered by Andrew Jamieson '99 at

13-6. Sam Sidiqi jumped to 1 foot personal best with a 12-6 effort for 3rd place.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">As usual, the running events offered a little more success for the

Varsity. Matt Sandholm showed that he is almost back with a 6.71 victory in the 55 dash.

Mark Dunzo '91 demonstrated that he could still turn them over as he ran 6.81 for 2nd. He

was followed closely by Akin Aina '96 in 6.82.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the High Hurdles, Singhose still reigned supreme, easily taking

Sastry in 7.7 to 8.1. Sherrett Walker '93 edged out Dave Ratliff '99 for third in 9.0</font>

</p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 200 meters was the 2nd to last event and was the last chance for the

Varsity to pull the meet out. The Varsity needed 1st and 2nd to have a realistic chance

with the 5000 and 800 relay remaining. However, Aina ran a great race, almost edging

Sandholm for 1st (23.58 to 23.78). Marlon Osbourne '98 was 3rd in 24.15.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 400 meters saw a Varsity sweep thanks to Singhose pulling up in the

1st turn. Osbourne, Brad Geilfuss 'G, and Neal Karchem '99 ran 1, 2, 3 with times of

53.84, 54.03, and 54.48.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the 800 meters the best race of the day developed as Dan Helgesen '97

was determined to succeed in taking down Ethan Crain '95. After having failed in the 1500

earlier, Dan tried a new tactic. He stayed back in the early part of the race and let his

teammates do the work. Edgar Ngwenya 'G took the early pace (28, 59) until Crain sprinted

to the front. Joel Ford '98 took off after Crain and passed him with 300 meters to go.

Helgesen then came out of nowhere and never looked back. Helgesen ran 1:59.84 to Crain's

1:59.97. Ford followed closely with a 2:00.91.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">As already mentioned, Crain showed no mercy in the 1500. Letting Leif

Seed '99 and Helgesen do the work in the early going, Ethan took the lead with 200 meters

to go. Leif did not respond soon enough and Dan was out of it until the last 50 meters.

Ethan ran 4:02.75 to Leif's 4:04.77 and Dan's 4:05.58.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the 5000 meters, freshman Chris McGuire missed Ethan Crain's freshman

record by 3 tenths of a second in his 5000 debut. McGuire, Terry McNatt '87, and Jesse

Darley '95 formed a tight pack for most of the race. Terry pulled away with about 3/4 of a

mile to go. McGuire ran a tough race. Even though he was in a lot of pain he maintained

his pace for a 15:27.42 3rd place finish. Terry won in 15:18.39 with Jesse close behind in

15:20.35.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 800 Relay was a formality, but nevertheless, both teams put forth a

great effort. The Alumni brought Ayisi Makatiani out of hiding as a surprise entrant, but

that was not enough as the Varsity easily pulled away with a time of 1:36.76.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">After the meet, both teams gathered at Coach Taylor's for some snacks,

refreshments, and good times. A good time was had by all, and the old-timers walked away

with pride intact.</font> </p>
