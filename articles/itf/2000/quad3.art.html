Lead MIT To Victory</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>MIT Men's Track and Field team traveled to New London, Connecticut
to the home of the Coast Guard Academy for Quad Cup III to face a
rematch with Bates College along with Westfield State, and WPI. Going
into the meet undefeated, but without top scorer Rick Rajter '03, who
has been scoring over 20 points per meet, MIT was unsure of victory,
particularly if Bates put up a fight similar to the one two weeks
ago.</P>

<P>Fellow freshman, Craig Mielcarz, achieved 3 season bests to help
lead Tech to a surprisingly easy victory with MIT scoring 241 1/4
points to Bates' 143 1/4, Coast Guard's 124, Westfield State's 80
1/4, and WPI's 5 1/4. In setting his season bests, Mielcarz won both
the Long Jump with 21-0, and the High Jump with a leap of 6-7. His
third PR occurred in the 55HH where he ran 8.35 to earn 4th place.
Mielcarz added an 8th place in the Shot Put for good measure to
finish with 24 points for the day. Mielcarz's winning long jump came
on his final jump to move him up from 3rd in dramatic fashion. In the
High Jump, he came right over from his hurdle race and popped a 6-4
leap. At 6-7, Mielcarz cleared it on his first attempt with plenty of
room to spare. </P>

<P>The other multiple winner was Sean Montgomery '01, who won both
the mile (4:22.06), and the 1000 Meter run (2:32.79). Montgomery ran
a sit and kick race in the mile, which proved very effective for both
him and Dan Feldman '02, who went with him to finish 2nd in 4:22.30.
In the 1000, Montgomery was running against a very good runner from
Bates who owned the best time in New England in the 1000 with a
2:33.59, and was fresh going into the race. After coming through the
400 in a respectable 60 seconds, Montgomery pulled away, surprising
the competition. Montgomery was able to cruise in to the finish
uncontested in 2:32.79.</P>

<P>Other winners were Kalpak Kothari '01, in the Triple Jump, Tony
Pelosi '01, in the 600, and freshman Sean Nolan in the 5000. Kothari
did not have a spectacular day in the Triple Jump, but neither did
anyone else. Kothari was consistently over 40' but was not able to do
better than 40-9 3/4. Pelosi decided that the best way to run a fast
600 would be to dictate the pace of the race, which he did from start
to finish in 1:27.42. Nolan became the 3rd fastest freshman in MIT
history in the 5K with a time of 15:24.37. Running behind a freshman
from Coast Guard, who had beat him all season in Cross Country, Nolan
took the lead once the pace slowed just after 2 miles. Nolan ran his
last mile under 4:50 and finished with a 31 last 200, showing that
there is more in the tank if he needs it.</P>

<P>Other notable season or personal bests were provided by many other
Engineers.  Dan Opila '03, vaulted 13-3 in the Pole Vault to lead a
2-3-4-5 finish. Robbie Gray '02, jumped 20-09 in the Long Jump to
claim 2nd in addition to his 3rd place in the Triple Jump, and 6th
place in the 55 Meter dash. Peter Bluvas '01, had a big day by
setting a PR in the 55HH with a 8.31 3rd place performance. Peter
also earned a 3rd in the Shot Put, an 8th in the Weight Throw, and
ran a fine leg on the 1600 Relay. In addition to Feldman's Mile Run,
he also earned 2nd in the 800 with a best of 2:01.25. Season bests
were provided by Phil Loiselle '01, Craig Wildman '03, and Kenny
Walker in the 1000 with times of 2:42.61, 2:44.99, and 2:46.44, but
their times will drop significantly as the season comes to an end
since Loiselle and Walker are just coming into form after early
season injuries, and Wildman had just completed his first double. In
the 5000, Ed Keehr '01, is getting back into shape and showed it with
a 15:57.41. Albert Liu also ran a PR in the low 16s, but there was an
error in the timing which is still being looked at.</P>

<P>Next week, the two best teams in New England Division III, both
undefeated, will go at it in the final Quad Cup meet of the season
when MIT travels to Tufts to see who will claim the title of Quad Cup
Champion.</P>
