Personal Bests</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>February 5, 2000</P>

<P>Like true Champions, MIT's Men's Track and Field team answered the
call against Tufts, Springfield, Wesleyan, and WPI today en route to
a victory that enabled them to finish the regular season and Quad Cup
undefeated. Entering the meet at Tufts beautiful new facility, both
Tufts and MIT were undefeated, with Tufts having the edge based on
the seed performances. Leaving the building, MIT had spoiled Tufts
perfect record in their new facility by scoring 213 points to Tufts'
197. Springfield finished with 105, Wesleyan 65, and WPI 10 points to
round out the team scoring.</P>

<P>Based on the seeds, Tufts University Jumobs were 14 point
favorites on their home track. However, MIT's Engineers believed the
Tufts track to be superior enough to account for much of the
difference in times run  and distances jumped. This combined with the
fact that MIT has won 16 of the previous 19 Indoor meetings with
Tufts during Coach Halston Taylor's tenure, gave Tech athletes the
feeling of confidence they needed to pull off the upset.</P>

<P>MIT was favored heavily in the jumps and needed to outscore Tufts
by enough to make up for the edge Tufts would accumulate in the
throws, sprints, and hurdles. First up was the Long Jump. Robbie Gray
'02, was the first one to jump 20-10. Soon afterward, Craig Mielcarz
joined Robbie at the same mark. Before long Rick Rajter also jumped
20-10 as did a freshman from Tufts. As the event progressed and both
teams lined the jumped pit, cheering with every jump, the Tufts
jumper took the lead with a 21-10 effort. Robbie Gray was next and
answered with a huge 22-02 1/4 leap. Mielcarz closed to 21-6, but was
not able to get any closer. Brian Hoying popped a 20-10 3/4 to pull
into 4th, and Rajter held onto 5th. What a start--24-9!</P>

<P>The Pole Vault was finishing about the same time as the Long Jump.
Tufts one pole vaulter was injured and could not compete. MIT was
favored to go 1-2-3, which they did with Dan Opila '03, Dan Kwon '02,
and Matt Potts '00, and added 5th from Steve Lefkowitz '00 for a 26-0
edge on Tufts.</P>

<P>The meet was a coed meet, the first for MIT this season, and
required a lot of patience as things unfolded much slower than usual.
On the plus side, both teams got to rest a lot more and bring their
top competitors back with much more rest. One of these situations
that MIT took advantage of was the fact that two of their best
sprinters, Todd Rosenfield '01, their top 400 entry, and Yuval Mazor
'02, their top 600 entry, would be able to run the dash. The 55 final
was immediately after the 600, and the trials were well before both
the 400 and 600. So, thanks to the extra rest provided by the women
running alternately with the men, both Todd and Yuval were entered in
the 55 with hopes of making the finals, which would make them
automatic point scorers, even if they finished in the last two
places. Not only did Marc Washington '03, and Robbie Gray run season
bests of 6.75 and 6.85 to make the finals, but so did Todd (6.87),
and Yuval (6.98). MIT ended up outscoring Tufts 13-12 in an event
where Tufts was favored 16-6.</P>

<P>Prior to the final of the dash, the first running final was the
1500. Tufts was favored to go 1-2 on 1500 times, but MIT's Sean
Montgomery '01, and Dan Feldman '02, had run mile times that
converted to faster 1500s than Tufts had run. The pace was reasonably
quick from a group whose top 5 seeds were all expected to run at
least two or three middle distance/distance events this day.
Montgomery was patient through the 800 in 2:09, then got tired of how
close the pack was and pulled out to a 3:12 1200 split before easing
home in 3:59.74. The real battle was for 2nd, as Lyons from Tufts
held off Feldman 4:00.41 to 4:00.74 in a furious kick over the final
200. Feldman ran 45 seconds over the final 300. Chris McGuire '00,
added his own personal best to the mix with a 4:02.76, good enough
for 6th and a 18-13 MIT edge in an event Tufts had counted on to
change the momentum.</P>

<P>The hurdles, another one of Tufts big events, went well for them
as they scored 1-2-4-7 for a 23-8 edge despite a personal best by
Junius Ho '01, of 8.15 for 5th place. This brought the score to 76-45
in MIT's favor.</P>

<P>The 400 and 600, scheduled to go 12-11 and 18-12 respectively in
Tuft's favor, went about as expected with Rosenfield leading the way
for Tech in the 400 with a PR of 51.21 for 3rd, and Mazor doing the
same in the 600 with a PR of 1:24.20. Overall, Tufts came out ahead
30-24, which was 1 more point in MIT's bag than expected. After the
before-mentioned 55, the score was MIT 113 and Tufts 87.</P>

<P>The High Jump, another of Tech's big events, went even better than
expected. While Tufts only was favored to score 5 points, Springfield
could cause some problems with their two 6-4 jumpers. Mielcarz and
Hoying put an end to that worry by both nailing 6-6 to go 1-2. Rajter
cleared 6-2 to follow the Springfield duo, and Roger Nielsen '01,
jumped 6-0 for 6th, which left Tufts to only claim 7th place and 2
points to MIT's 23.</P>

<P>The Weight Throw and Shot Put, known to be Tech weaknesses this
year, stayed true to form as Peter Bluvas '01, managed the only
points with a 41-9 in the Shot for 7th place. Fortunately,
Springfield helped out greatly by scoring 45 points in the two events
to Tufts 20. </P>

<P>Tufts was creeping closer, but with the Triple Jump remaining and
MIT still ahead 138-109, Tufts was going to have to do some serious
damage in the middle distance events. Two of these events, the 800
and 1000 were up next and Tufts was supposed to outscore MIT 35-20.
</P>

<P>Feldman and McGuire were coming back in the 800 to prevent Tufts
from making their comeback. However, both thought there were going to
be two sections of the 800, and neither had completed their warmup
when they were called to the line. Fortunately, John Biesiadecki '01,
and George Hanson '03, both ran PRs of 2:00.18, and 2:01.69 to pace
MIT with 3rd and 5th place finishes. Feldman and McGuire added 7th
and 8th with 2:02 times to outscore Tufts 13-12.</P>

<P>Montgomery was back up in the 1000, which again proved to be a "no
contest", as he walked away and then cruised to victory in 2:33.45.
Phil Loiselle '01, and Craig Wildman '03 added superb 6th and 8th
place finishes to hold Tufts to 15 points to Tech's 13, almost making
the two events a wash.</P>

<P>It was looking like Tufts was running out of time, but the 200
made it close again as Mazor and Rosenfield were only able to place
4th and 8th despite a PR by Yuval of 23.43. This moved Tufts to
within 15 with the 3000 next for the team that placed 9th at the
National Cross Country Championship. Once again Feldman and McGuire
toed the line along with freshman Sean Nolan who was proving this
season that he was not going to sit back and watch others take all
the glory.</P>

<P>Tufts' runners took the pace out hard in a 4:35 first mile. Nolan,
Feldman, and McGuire trailed by 4-6 seconds but were within striking
distance. With 800 meters to go, Nolan and Feldman began to close on
the leaders. With 200 to go, perhaps a little late, Feldman dug down
and ran a 30 second last lap to finish 2nd by less than a second in
8:41.81. Nolan closed to 4th in a fantastic time of 8:44.55. McGuire
faded a bit at the end, but finished in a very respectable 8:53.39
for 7th in his 3rd race of the day. MIT's lead was down to 7 points
as Tufts took the event 22-14.</P>

<P>Then there was the Triple Jump. MIT jumpers again dominated as
they went 1-2-4-6, led by Kalpak Kothari '01, with a 43-5 3/4 leap to
secure the team victory going into the relays. Also scoring were 
Rajter, who only took one jump, Ho, who set a PR of 41-1 1/2, and
Gray.</P>

<P>The best event of the day was by far the1600 Meter Relay. Both
teams were tired, but both wanted the victory. Mazor led off for Tech
with a understandably tired 52.5 leg to put MIT about 15 meters
behind Tufts. Matt Lehman '03, made up nearly all of that distance
with a superb 50.8 leg. Rosenfield took down a tired Tufts' runner
who had won the 600 and place 2nd in the 1000, with a 50.7 leg. This
gave Montgomery about a 10 meter lead at the handoff. He quickly
expanded the lead with a fast first 20 meters. Lemieux from Tufts, a
freshman who had won both the 200 and 400, sprinted to make up the
difference but could only make up half the distance on the first 200.
In the final 200, Lemieux closed fast to pull even on the final
straight. Montgomery was holding the lead but was beginning to tie
up. At the line, Tufts pulled out the relay in a lean, running
3:24.64 to MIT's 3:24.69. Montgomery had run 50.6 to cap a fine day
of running, but it was not quite enough on this day in this event.
However, this did nothing to sour the team victory by MIT.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT is at home to host the Quad Cup Invitational, a
non-scoring meet to tune-up for the Division III Championships the
following weekend.</P>
