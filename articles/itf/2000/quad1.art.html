UNDEFEATED</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Despite Being Underdogs, Tech Responds To Get
Job Done</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">January<B> </B>15, 2000</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">MIT's Track and Field team traveled to Lewiston,
Maine Saturday to compete in the season's first Quad Cup against
Bates, UMass/Lowell, and USM. The Engineers rallied from their
underdog position to win the meet with 183.5 points to UMass/Lowell's
179, Bates' 169.5, and USM's 60. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">After receiving the seeds on Friday night, the MIT
track team's first reaction was one of "how can we possibly win this
one". The second response was, "let's do what we have to do to win
this meet". The seed performances, which are turned in by the head
coaches, had Division 2 powerhouse, UMass Lowell, favored to win with
221 points. Host, Bates College, was favored to garner 2nd place with
151 points, while MIT was seeded 3rd with 135 points. Bringing up the
rear was up and coming University of Southern Maine with 90
points.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">MIT had two things in their favor, one, all of
their performances had been on the tight turns of the MIT track, and
two, all of their performances had come in single gender meets where
time between an athlete's events is minimal. Tech hoped to respond to
the higher level of competition, run faster on the Bates' track, have
the athletes returning from injuries compete well, and hope the
intensity of this meet helped them and hurt their
opponents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The first event to finish as a final, even though
the field events had started an hour before, was the Mile Run. Sean
Montgomery '01, almost back to full health from an early season
recurring knee injury, responded reasonably well to the fast pace of
Matt Twiest of Bates, and finished 2nd with a 4:21.36. Dan Feldman
'02, ran a personal best with a 4:21.59 to finish 3rd, and Chris
McGuire '00, finished 6th with a 4:26.02 performance. MIT was behind
Bates 16 to 18 right out of the blocks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Weight Throw was next, and Bates did not
hesitate to capitalize on the throwing woes of MIT by sweeping the
first 4 places to score 27 points. Peter Bluvas '01, came through for
Tech and earned a 5th place for 4 points. However, being down 45 to
20 after 2 events was daunting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The High Hurdles, an event where MIT was only
supposed to score 6 compared to Lowell's 23, had to be the
turnaround. In Tech's favor were the trials where all four MIT
entrants qualified for the final with three season bests. In the
final, Rick Rajter '03, ran another PR of 8.15 to earn 3rd place.
Junius Ho '01, did not run a season best, but he did run well,
placing 5th in 8.33. Craig Mielcarz '03, ran his second season best
of the day, placing 7th with a 8.40. Peter Bluvas finished 8th, also
with a season best of 8.54.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The next event, the 400, was another event that
Lowell was seeded to score big in with 24 points. Bates and MIT had
something to say about that as they both scored 9 to leave Lowell
with 16. Todd Rosenfield '01, placed 4th with a best of 51.45, and
Yuval Mazor '02, placed 5th with a 51.46. The score after 4 events
was Bates 64, MIT 42, and Lowell 38.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The High Jump, an event MIT hoped to dominate,
went very well. Both Mielcarz, and fellow freshman, Brian Hoying,
cleared 6-5 to earn 1st and 2nd respectively. Rajter also tied for
5th to give Tech 19.5 points.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The next two events, the 600 and 55 went Lowell's
way as they scored 33 points to Bates' 12, and MIT's 14. Matt Lehman
'03, led the way for Tech in the 600 with a 1:27.44 for 5th place,
while Marc Washington '03, did the same in the dash with a
6.87.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The results of the Long Jump, an event that MIT
was hoping for some big things, was perhaps the only event of the day
that did not go in Tech's favor. Rajter came through with a season
best of 20-02 3/4 for 5th place, but no other Engineer made the
finals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Montgomery came back with a vengeance in the 800,
running away with a 1:58.84 victory. A supporting cast of Alan
Raphael '02, (4th), John Biesiadecki '01, (6th), and George Hanson
'03, (7th) all ran season bests to give MIT 19 points and the lead
over Bates by 1 point.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Feldman and McGuire returned to the track in the
1000 along with Phil Loiselle '01, returning from injury, to total 8
points, although Lowell scored 20 to lead the meet 13 points .
Feldman ran a 2:36.16 for an excellent performance, but Bates had
tied MIT's score.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The 200 was the biggest surprise of the meet for
MIT. Favored to score 0 points, Mazor, Rosenfield, and Kamal Mokeddem
all ran bests to score 8 points. Bates scored 12 and Lowell 10, but
it could have been much worse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Pole Vault and Triple Jump, two of MIT's best
events, proved the difference in the meet. In the Vault, Dan Kwon
'02, Dan Opila '03, and Matt Potts '00, placed 3rd, 4th, and 5th
respectively to give MIT 15 points and bring them within 1 point of
Bates and 10.5 of Lowell. Rajter, once again came through to win the
Triple with a PR of 44-0 to finish with 22.5 points. Rick was
supported by Kalpak Kothari '01, Robbie Gray '02, and Junius Ho '01,
with 3rd, 4th, and 5th places respectively.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The lead was now in MIT's favor at 153.5 to Bates
142.5, and Lowell's 140. However the Shot Put was not looking good
for MIT as Bluvas failed to the make the finals by 2". Lowell retook
the lead by scoring 21 points.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">MIT returned the shutout favor to Lowell by taking
18 points in the 5000 to go into the relays with a 8 points lead over
Bates and 10.5 points over Lowell. The marvelous job in the 5000 was
not by the usual cast of Feldman and McGuire. Instead, Liyan Guo '01,
led the way with a 15:49.42 2nd place finish. Running a PR, freshman
Sean Nolan ran 15:49.99 for 3rd. Still trying to get back in
condition after a season ending injury in Cross Country, Ed Keehr
'01, ran to a 6th place, while freshman Albert Liu ran a very well
paced race to claim 7th in a PR of 16:43.99.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The relays were being scored 9-6-3-0, so as long
as MIT earned no worse than 2nd place in both relays, they would win
the meet. Realizing that both Lowell and Bates had very good relay
teams, MIT brought back all their best runners to answer the bell one
more time. Both relays were won by UMass Lowell, but MIT easily
handled 2nd place to secure the victory and stay
undefeated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Next week, MIT is at home vs. Bowdoin,
Springfield, and USM.</FONT></P>
