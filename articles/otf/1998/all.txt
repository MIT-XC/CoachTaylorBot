    CUP**
    
    
    
    **RPI SPRINTERS RACE TO FIRST VICTORY EVER OVER
    MIT**
    
    
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    For the first time ever, MIT lost the coveted Engineers' Cup in
    Men's Track & Field.  A strong RPI team came to town and ran
    roughshod on the Beavers, taking a 96.5-77.5 win, with WPI a
    "thanks-for-playing" third at 29.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT led through 10 events, and was still close (8 points) through
    13, but when RPI went 1-2-3 in the 200 to open up a 17-point lead,
    the "fat lady" began to sing.
    
    
    
    
    
    The day was not without bright spots however.  Team co-captain
    Ravi Sastry '98 was a double winner, scoring firsts in his
    specialties, the Long Jump (21'7.5") and 110 Meter Hurdles (:15.70). 
    He also contributed 3rd's in the 100 and High Jump, and led off the
    second-place 4x100 Relay team.
    
    
    
    
    
    Leif Seed '99 picked up two victories also, racing to a convincing
    win in the 1500 (4:08.09), and coming back to win a tough battle in
    the 400 Meter Hurdles (:58.05).
    
    
    
    
    
    Distance stars Mike Parkins '99 and Chris McGuire '00 both won
    their premier events, the 3000 Meter Steeplechase (9:41.1), and the
    5000 Meters (15:34), respectively.  Both were New England Division
    III champions in those events last May.  McGuire also placed second
    in the 1500.
    
    
    
    
    
    The other MIT wins came on clutch performances by freshmen.  John
    Biesiadecki led the 800 Meters from wire to wire and scored his first
    collegiate win (2:01.44).  Nick Michalakas, from Greece, threw the
    Javelin 163'8" to pull out his first victory by one inch.
    
    
    
    
    
    Of the non-winning performances, George Torres '99 probably had
    the best day, qualifying for the New England Div. III Championships
    in both the Hammer (150'1") and the Discus (137'6").
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT is home for the last time this season against
    Bates, Bowdoin, and Colby at 1:30.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    






    
    
    
    **TRACK TEAM TAKES DOWN MAINE SCHOOLS WITH
    STRONG PERFORMANCES**
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    In an impressive rebound from last week's loss to RPI, the
    Engineers scorched the State o' Maine on Saturday at Steinbrenner
    Stadium.  Senior Captain Ravi Sastry put up some big numbers,
    collecting three wins, in the Long Jump (22'2.5"), 100 Meter Dash
    (:11.0), and 110 Meter Hurdles (:14.9) -- all in personal record (PR)
    times -- to go with thirds in the 200 (:23.1, another PR) and High
    Jump (5'10"), for a total of 18.5 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    Junior Leif Seed posted a double victory as well, first exploding
    away from the 1500 Meter field with a sub-60 final lap, and then
    storming to a big win in the 400 Meter Hurdles in PR time (:56.4). In
    all, MIT captured 11 first places, to Colby's 5, Bowdoin's 2, and
    Bates' 1.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT started slowly, and actually trailed Colby after 3 events
    (9-11).  Mike Parkins '99 got the team rolling with his powerful
    late-race surge to win the 3000 Meter Steeplechase in a NE3-leading
    9:28.5. 
    
    
    
    
    
    Seed then led a 1-2-4 charge in the 1500, with Chris McGuire '00
    2nd (4:08.50), and Sohail Husain '98 a close 4th in a PR 4:10.10.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sastry, fresh from his long jump win, romped in his specialty 110H
    race, with Junius Ho '01 racing well for a solid 4th (:16.1 PR), and
    MIT's momentum was hitting stride. 
    
    
    
    
    
    Sean Montgomery '01 (:51.2) and Neal Karchem '99 (:51.7) chopped
    chunks off last week's times with strong races.  Their 3rd and 4th
    place finishes gave the team the points needed to prevent any big
    moves by their northern opponents.
    
    
    
    
    
    Captain Rav then put paid to any ambitions the Maine men might
    have had by ambushing the flat sprinters with a big win in the
    century, and the Beavers never looked back.
    
    
    
    
    
    Kalpak Kothari '01 produced the biggest stun of the meet, PR'ing
    by more than a foot (42'6.25"), and defeating Bates' NE3 Indoor
    Champion.  Sam Thibault '00 got his second best TJ of his career
    (40'8.75") and took 4th.
    
    
    
    
    
    When Joel Ford '98 (1:58.4) and John Biesiadecki (1:59.6) routed
    the 800 field,  and Seed had blasted away the 400 Meter Hurdles race,
    the Beavers had opened a  22-point margin over Colby, with Bates and
    Bowdoin well behind.
    
    
    
    
    
    As in the 400, the 200 tandem of Sastry (:23.1) and Todd
    Rosenfield '01 (:23.3) kept the wolves from the door, as both posted
    PR' s for 3rd and 4th.
    
    
    
    
    
    There were three times in the meet (the High Jump being the third)
    when MIT took 3-4 and the opponents split 1-2, holding their gain to
    a minimum 2 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sam Thibault '00 launched himself to a new PR in winning the Pole
    Vault with a 14'1" clearance that gave him the top spot in NE3, and
    essentially clinched the triple-win for MIT.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 5000 squad took care of business, running with confidence and
    aggressiveness, and came away with a sturdy 1-3-4 result.  McGuire,
    the defending NE3 champion in this event, dispatched his challengers
    and clocked a 4:47 last mile in a statement-making 15:16.7.  CC
    co-captain Rich Rosalez '98, running in his final home meet, ran a PR
    15:43.7 to take 3rd place, with freshmen Liyan Guo (4th, 15:57.2) and
    Ed Keehr (5th, 16:00.8) stomping their old marks and their
    opposition.
    
    
    
    
    
    Freshman Nikos Michalakas '01 kept his collegiate record perfect
    (2-0), by tossing the spear 176'3" for his second straight win.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 4x400 Meter Relay team presaged some very good things with a
    tough and competitive race.  Monty opened with a :51.6, shared a
    clumsy handoff with Leif, whose :51.0 then surged MIT into the lead. 
    Joel's :51.5 gave Neal a 12-meter lead.  Neal's :50.8 anchor was
    ferocious, but Colby's NE3 Indoor 400 Champ had just enough to edge
    him out by 0.2 seconds.  MIT's 3:24.8 clocking was their fastest in
    recent memory, and all team members look forward to running much
    faster later on. 
    
    
    
    
    
    The team's record is now 4-1 on the season.  Next Saturday, MIT
    takes on some serious Division I competition at Northeastern
    University in Dedham.  URI (2nd place in Indoor All-NE's).
    UMass-Amherst, Dartmouth, Northeastern, and Bentley (Div. II) will
    all be there, so high caliber competition will be the order of the
    day.
    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    **ENGINEERS PREPARE FOR NE DIV. III
    CHAMPIONSHIP WITH STELLAR OUTING AT WILLIAMS**
    
    
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    The MIT Men's Track & Field team trekked to the remote corner
    of the Bay State and visited our rival Williams College for a
    non-scoring quad meet in preparation for next weekend's New England
    Division III Championships.
    
    
    
    
    
    Captain Ravi Sastry '98 was given a "day off", seeing duty only in
    the 4x100 relay.  As a whole, there were few fireworks from the jumps
    and throws today, although Patrick Dannen '98, Kalpak Kothari '01,
    and Nikos Michalakas '01 captured victories in the SP, TJ, and JT,
    respectively.  And Sam Thibault '00,Matt Potts '00 (PR 13'3"), and
    Sam Towell '00 swept the PV.  
    
    
    
    
    
    This day belonged to the mid-distance guys.  Leif Seed '99 was the
    show today, and the rest of the MD crew followed suit.  Leif, on the
    rebound from lower leg woes, followed a strong and steady pace for
    1000 meters, then took command on the 1500, and ran a 60-flat closing
    lap in a 3:58.53 win.  Sohail Husain '98, ran a fiercely competitive
    race, and chopped yet another 4 seconds off his PR by clocking
    4:03.97 and qualifying for NE-3.  Chris McGuire '00 dropped down from
    the 5K and logged his 2nd best 1500 ever (4:05.27).  Kaoru Aou '00
    certainly deserves print for slashing 3 more seconds off his previous
    best; today's 4:24.91 represents an 11-second improvement this
    season.
    
    
    
    
    
    Full of run, Seed came back and lit the 800 up.  He and Joel Ford
    '98 powered through a 55-second opening lap, and dispatched all
    challengers en route a 1-2 finish. Both posted PR's, with Leif's
    1:54.7 leading Joel's 1:56.1 across the line.  In the unseeded
    section, McGuire took advantage of the rare chance to hone his
    kicking skills (his is one of the most potent finishing rushes in
    NE-3), and broke 2:00 in his first attempt at the half (1:59.63). 
    Senior Chuck Van Buren ended his MIT Track career with a season-best
    (#2 lifetime) 2:03.60.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the 4x400, MIT sweized the opportunity to upstage the hosts. 
    Williams held the #5 NE-3 ranking, with MIT 6th, but the Beavers took
    the race fro the opening leg and turned back the home team, with our
    fastest time of the year, 3:24.61.   Freshman Sean Montgomery was the
    highliight, spinning his leadoff leg in :50.6, and giving us a lead
    we would not relinquish.  Joel's :51.5 carry held the advantage, and
    when Williams' #3 man pulled up on Todd Rosenfield's shoulder at
    200m, the plucky freshman held him off and pulled away (:52.1),
    giving Neal Karchem '99, an 8-meter lead which he protected
    tenaciously with his :50.7 anchor.
    
    
    
    
    
    Other highlights included senior Rich Rosalez's 10K victory that
    should prolong his career another week into NE-3's, freshman Mark
    Strauss' solid solo Steeplechase win.
    
    
    
    
    
    Good spirits prevailed as we left for home.  The team is eager for
    next week's Championships at Middlebury College in Vermont.
