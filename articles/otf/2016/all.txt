    ### Two MIT Records, Three More National Qualifiers Lead Engineers at ECAC DIII Championship
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 18-19, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    As MIT prepares for the NCAA Division III Championship next week, the final opportunity to make the NCAA field was the ECAC Division III Championship hosted by Westfield State University.  The Engineers did not let the chance go to waste as they qualified for Nationals in three more events.  
    
    
                  
    
    Bailey Tregoning '19 continued to surprise her opponents as their seems to be no limit to what the freshman can achieve. The 800 specialist, having dropped three more seconds last week when she earned second place at the NEICAAA Championship with her 2:11.51 was sitting in 19th position on the NCAA list where only the top 22 women would be selected in each event.  She knew her time would probably not hold and would likely have to run sub 2:11 to make the final field.  The pace for the first 400 was a casual 65.8, meaning Tregoning was going to have to take control and negative split her race.  She did just that as she eased to the front on the backstretch, accelerating into the final 200 where she gapped the field to win in 2:10.84.  In the process she broke her own MIT varsity and freshman records.
    
    
                  
    
    The men's 4x400 Relay also needed a faster time in order to qualify.  Currently only having a 3:16.73, they knew it would take at least a 3:14 to have a good chance of making the field.  MIT decided to leave one of the faster legs (Michael Kaba '16) out of the relay to save his foot from too much racing and, more importantly, so that if the team were to qualify it would give them an automatic substitute since Kaba was already in both the 110HH and 400IH fields. As the second seeded team they were not sure the competition would be enough to pull them along to a fast enough time.  States Lee '16 returning to competition after missing the past two meets with a ligament injury, led off with a solid 48.7. Chris Sweeney '18 blistered the first 200, taking a commanding lead, but paid dearly in the final straight as he handed off in 49.0.  It seemed unlikely the Tech runners would be able to run the necessary splits to reach 3:14.  Fortunately no one told Derek Barnes '16 and Danny Newman '17.  Barnes ran the third leg, starting with the lead and holding it throughout the entire lap, splitting an amazing 47.8.  The handoff to Newman was excellent, giving him a nice running start.  Newman fought off the other anchor legs, crossing the line in 3:13.32 for the victory, splitting 47.5 and earning his team a trip to Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa, the site of next week's National Championship.
    
    
                  
    
    Ariela Slutsky '18 was hoping to qualify for Nationals in the Discus, but knew she needed to add significantly to her 141-3 PR from last week.  Her first five throws were either flat releases or nice angles with no finish.  However, on her final throw she put it together, throwing 148-7 to move up to second place and put herself in the NCAA field of qualified discus throwers. Cody Bratten '18 was hoping to accomplish the same thing, but fell just short, throwing a fine 152-10 for sixth place.
    
    
                  
    
    While the 4x100 Relay (Sweeney, Kaba, Newman, Tre Albritten '18) was also hoping to drop their time to make the national field, it was not to be.  A couple of poor starts and not having the best handoffs resulted in a 41.72 season best, but not fast enough to prolong their season.
    
    
                  
    
    Ben Schreck 'G put together a 15-7 1/4 vault, but kept blowing through poles as he tried to clear 16', eventually running out of attempts as he tried to find the right pole.  He earned third place while teammate Scott Cameron '19 placed eighth with a 15-1 1/2 vault.  In the women's vault, Jen Tylock '17 was still not cleared from her concussion, but Sherry Wan '16 was hoping to improve enough to join her teammate at Nationals.  Wan performed well, clearing a PR of 11-10, but was unable to go any higher.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT left most of their jumpers at home, but they did bring Carrington Motley '16 and Angel Echevarria '16.  Motley, already going to Nationals, nevertheless wanted to work on improving his jump.   Echevarria had not qualified and thought that he had the jump in him to get the job done.  Motley earned third place with a 47-5 jump, just fouling a couple of longer jumps.  Echevarria never got it going, jumping 44-2.
    
    
                  
    
    Albritten  placed second in the 200, running an excellent 21.57 in zero wind.  Taking the previous week off from competing and only racing the 200 and 4x100 this week should have the sophomore ready for the NCAA Division III Championship.              
    
    
                  
    
    Kaba ran 14.68 in the 110HH trials and then 14.62 in the finals to place fourth.  He is very close to making a big drop in time, which will be needed to score at Nationals.  He did not race in the 400IH in order to save his foot for next week.  Sweeney won his section in the 400IH, but fell just short of making the NCAA field, placing fourth overall in 53.73.
    
    
                  
    
    Benji Xie 'G, having won the 10K each of the past two weeks, winning the New England Division III and NEICAAA titles, wanted to try one more time to make Nationals, this time in the 5K.  The pace was never fast enough by the leaders, running just barely sub 70 pace for splits of 4:39 and 9:18. Xie's legs started feeling the effects of the weeks of racing, preventing him from speeding up.  However, his determination was outstanding as he only slowed to 71 pace, finishing in second place with a 14:38.07.
    
    
                  
    
    Natalie Alper '17 was another MIT athlete looking for a qualifying mark. Unable to jump well due to a strained hamstring the past two weeks, the junior was finally able to jump without worry.  After clearing 5-4 1/2 she had a fine attempt at 5-6 1/2 but was unable to clear.  She did place sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen '18 once again had a great start in the 400IH, and even though she was on 17 steps, her backstretch was just too slow, allowing the entire field to get the lead on her.  She again finished strong until the final hurdle, but only managed 62.17 in placing third.
    
    
                  
    
    Although leaving most jumpers and distance runners at home, as well as others, the Engineers still placed second in the men's meet with 58 points and the women placed sixth with 31 points, using only six athletes.

    ### Gong Runs National Qualifying Performance in 5K
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 22, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    Only five athletes made the trip down to Princeton University from MIT for the Larry Ellis Invitational.  Freshman Bailey Tregoning raced the 800 with a goal to get closer to a national qualifying time.  As she makes a comeback from low serum ferritin she is also building back her confidence.  After a 65.4 opening 400 and being in a great position to go for the win in her section, she panicked a bit, missing the opportunity for a great time.  Nevertheless she ran a 2:15.81 and is clearly on the verge of a big breakthrough.
    
    
                  
    
    Three women represented MIT in the 5K, all seeking NCAA Division III qualifying performances.  The NCAA no longer has qualifying standards, instead taking the top 22 women per event and the top 20 men.  Maryann Gong '17 and Nicole Zeinstra '16 were in the top section.  Gong, also in the process of regaining her confidence as she comes back from a lower leg injury, was reluctant to go with the leaders once the pace picked up from 80 second pace to 77 after two laps.  Instead she  settled in with 82's, running 5:17, 5:23, 5:26 for the first three 1600's, closing with a 37 for a 16:43.96, a time that will easily get her into the NCAA Championship field.
    
    
                  
    
    Zeinstra went out too fast for her current condition as she returns from a concussion that had her out of workouts for two weeks.  Her initial 5:20 1600 put her in a hole physically and mentally.  From that point she no longer raced, running 6:00 1600 pace the final 2K for a final time of 17:54.52.
    
    
                  
    
    Mary Eccles '18 looked to be having a great race out of section two as she settled in with 74-75 400's.  Her first 1600 was 5:37.  However, as the group started to spread out she was unable to respond due to tight calves.  Her second 1600 slowed to a 5:43, but then she slowed drastically, running the final 1600 in 5:53, and finishing in 17:58.06
    
    
                  
    
    The lone male runner representing MIT was Benji Xie 'G.  Xie is still making a comeback from an injury he had during the winter.  He is in very solid racing shape, but perhaps not quite where he needs to be to run mid-14's for 5K.  However, he went for it to see where he is with regard to overall fitness. He established himself near the back of the pack, moving up as the pace settled.  His initial 1600 was a crisp 4:38, one which he would have a difficult time holding and he was having some breathing problems as well, but when fatigue hit he fought well, only slowing to a 4:49.  However, the wheels definitely came off  as he paid for the initial pace and whatever was causing his breathing issues.  His final 1600 was a 5:14 and overall time a 15:19.92.
    
    
                  
    
    Both the men and women start their championship season next weekend with the NEWMAC Conference Championship at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT.  The men have not lost the championship since 2000 and the women have won every championship since 2009.

    ### Event Victories Add Up to Win Quad Meet
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 9, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Men's and Women's Track & Field teams were favored to win their home Quad meet against Bates, RPI and Tufts, and despite not competing many athletes for precautionary measures with regard to injuries, and a more competitive schedule coming up in the remaining weeks, both the men and women came away with 10 event victories each, leading each team to the overall win.  The men overcame no entries in the Steeplechase and a lack of healthy runners in the middle-distance events to win with 232 points to 158 for RPI, 146 for Bates and 125 for Tufts.  The women overcame a severe lack of available depth in the running events shorter than the 5K by scoring 142 of their 206.5 points in the eight field events to win over RPI with 149 points, Tufts with 147.5 and Bates with 147.
    
    
                  
    
    Jackie Vahey '18 led the women with three victories to lead them with 27 points in the 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 scoring format.  She started by winning the Discus with a 137-10 1/4 effort in a 1-2-7 finish, then took the Shot Put by a centimeter over teammate Isabella Stuopis '16 at 39-10 1/2 for a 1-2-3 effort and finished with a Hammer victory at 159-4 3/4 to help her team to a 1-4-5-8 dominance.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers did not compete anyone in the 3000 Steeplechase due to injury and did not need to run the 4x400 Relay at the end of the meet having already clenched the victory.  
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen '18 scored 21 3/4 points although she was only victorious in the 400IH at 63.49.  In the Long Jump her coaches limited her to three attempts, which netted her a fourth place at 16-9 1/4 in support of her teammates Nneoma Okonkwo '18, who won the event at 17-11 1/2 and Haley Strouf '18, who placed third with a jump of 17-2. She then anchored her team of Okonkwo, Strouf, and Kendra Knittel '17 to place second in the 4x100 Relay in 49.25. Prior to the 400IH she had to run two and a third efforts in the 100HH to finish third in 15.73 into the wind.  In the first 100HH, the starter's pistol had a faulty shell that was not loud enough to start the automatic timing system.  After the men's 110HH race, the women ran again. Another misfire was caught and the women stopped after three hurdles.  Finally, the fatigued group of hurdlers completed the race, giving Chen the third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Knittel added a victory in the 400 in 59.64 and a second place into the wind in 26.46 to add 17 3/4 points to her team's effort.  Okonkwo placed second in the 100, also into the wind in 12.95 to  give her 17 3/4 points as well.
    
    
                  
    
    Natalie Alper '17 only competed in the High Jump as she comes back from a minor hip flexor injury.  She made the most of that effort, winning with a 5-4 1/4 performance.  Taylor V'Dovec '19 and Katherine Prutz '18 added a third and fourth at 5-0 1/4.  The most dominant event by far was the Pole Vault.  Sherry Wan '16 led the 1-2-3-4-6 domination with an outdoor PR of 11-7 3/4.  Jen Tylock '17 added a second at 11-1 3/4, then Makenzie Patarino '19 claimed third, also at 11-1 3/4, followed by Madeleine Waller '17 in fourth at 10-8.  Leah Schmitz '16 closed out the scoring with a 9-2 1/4 for sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    Dana Balek '18 had a come from behind victory in the Javelin, throwing a personal best of 120-1 1/2 on her fifth throw. The final victory by Tech was earned by Mary Eccles '18 in the 5K.  Eccles stole the event by turning a 76 opening 400 to open up an 80 meter lead on the rest of the pack that began the race with an 88 first 400.  The wind and lack of competition had her running 85-86 pace for most of the rest of the way, gradually opening up a 100 meter lead on the chase pack as she lapped the majority of the field.  In the final two laps, Jessica Wilson of Bates made a hard charge to nearly catch Eccles, but could not quite complete the task as Eccles won in 17:47.85.
    
    
                  
    
    The men's victory was more spread out in that the Engineers scored 102 in the field events and 130 in the running events despite losing nine points by dropping the baton in the 4x100 Relay for the second time in three meets.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT was led by two double winners.  Tre Albritten '18, running both of his races into the wind, took the 100 in 11.06 and then returned later to claim first place honors in the 200 in 22.34.  The other double winner was Michael Kaba '16, who easily won the 110HH into the wind in 15.37 and then ran a season best of 53.71 in winning the 400IH.  Both Albritten and Kaba ran the failed 4x100 Relay, comprising the first two legs.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers had many dominant events.  The highest scoring event was the Triple Jump with 25 points.  Billy Ruschel '18 won the event with a leap of 45-10 and was supported by Angel Echevarria '16 taking second place, Carrington Motley '16 claiming fourth and Ryan Prinster '18 earning fifth.  The next highest scoring event was the 400 with 24 points where Tech went 1-2-3-7.  States Lee '16 took first in 48.60, Danny Newman '17 second in 49.26, Derek Barnes '16 third in 49.57 and Tom Frejowski '19 seventh n 51.03.  At 23 points, the MIT 200 runners, led by Albritten, took 1-2-3-8 finishes.  Lee was second, Newman third and Barnes eighth.  The final dominant event was the Long Jump, scoring 22 points for MIT.  Arinze Okeke '17 won  at 21-11, followed by Motley in third at 21-2, Ruschel in fourth at 21-0 and Prinster in eighth.
    
    
                  
    
    There were two victories earned by freshman. Scott Cameron '19 earned the victory in the Pole Vault with a jump of 14-11.  Jarod Wilson '19, after failing to win the 1500 when he took the lead a little prematurely with 400 to go and started doubting himself, came back in the 800 to run a flawless come from behind victory in 1:54.98.  The final victory of the day was earned by the 4x400 Relay.  Frejowski led off with a 52.5.  Henry Tareque '17 put his team right on the tail of the leader with a 51.4.  Talla Babou '19 ran a very competitive 52.6 to keep his team close, handing off about five meters out of first.  Newman, making up for the dropped baton in the 4x100, ran a 49.5 to pull out the victory in 3:25.90.
    
    
                  
    
    A notable performance were turned in by Alex Noakes '16, throwing a PR of 150-1 3/4 for fourth place in the Hammer.  The 5K also produced spectacular competition in the 45 degree, cloudy and windy conditions.  Benji Xie 'G returned to competitive form following an injury to take third in 15:04.55, taking the lead in the final 400, but lacking the final kick to hold it.  Daniel Weiss '19 followed in fifth in 15:11.09.  David Walter '18 ran a superb race to finish sixth in 15:12.74 and Cooper Sloan '18 claimed seventh place in 15:19.98.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week MIT travels to Williams College for a good old-fashioned dual meet.  The meet should be a classic matchup between the top two Division III teams in New England.

    ### MIT Sets Two MIT Records in First Day at NCAA Division III Championship - Come Away With 10 All America Honors
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 26-28, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    The night before Nationals there is always a banquet for the athletes and coaches where the season's awards are presented.  MIT often comes away with a few of these awards and this year was no different.  Jackie Vahey won the New England Region Female Field Event Athlete of the Year.  Nick Davis earned the New England Region Men's Assistant Coach of the Year and Halston Taylor was awarded the New England Region Men's Head Coach of the Year.  Although both Carrington Motley and Maryann Gong had perfect cumulative GPA's, neither had the highest number of academic units, thus losing the tie-breaker for the Elite 90 Award.
    
    
                  
    
    Day one of the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field Championship at Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa turned out to be a much better day for MIT than was expected.  With thunder storms predicted for the entire three days of the meet, the NCAA committee decided to move the time schedule forward two hours to try and get day one in uninterrupted.  Not only did that work, but the MIT team seemed to also do well with that change.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's Long Jump was the first event for Tech.  In the third round, Nneoma Okonkwo '18 put out a bomb of a jump at 19-6, breaking her own MIT record by 6.75", and taking the lead.  Two jumpers were motivated by that jump, passing Okonkwo going into the finals.  In the first round of finals she was passed by one more jumper, but the sophomore was able to hold onto fourth place after only being seeded 10th.  Haley Strouf '18 jumped 17-8 1/4 and barely fouled a jump that would have put her in the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Michael Kaba '16 ran 53.05 in the 400IH to qualify for finals on Saturday.  The race was not pretty, but Kaba got the job done in the second half of the race.  The women were next, and although her race also had its glitches, Hannah Chen '18 had the fourth fastest time in the trials, tying her PR of 61.03.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up was the 200 with Tre Albritten '18 representing MIT.  Albritten did not have the best first 100, but it is the second hundred that counts and he made certain that it did.  He placed seventh overall in 21.67, running into a slight headwind, making the finals on Saturday.
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's Discus Throw, Jackie Vahey '17 placed 11th at 141-0 and Ariela Slutsky threw 133-1. Neither made the finals, but both threw about their average throw for the season.
    
    
                  
    
    Although Cimmy Virdi '16 was not able to defend her national title due to her torn ACL, Jen Tylock '17 was representing her team for the first time at this level of competition.  Tylock cleared her first two heights 11-05 3/4 and then 11-11 3/4 before failing at 12-3 1/2, which would have been a new PR. The women's Pole Vault is improving at an amazing rate.  It took 12-7 1/2 to place eighth and earn All America status this year.
    
    
                  
    
    Maryann Gong '17 and Mary Eccles '18 represented MIT in the 10K.  The weather was in the low 80's at the start of the race and quite humid, certainly not conducive to fast times.  Eccles competed well, but did not have her best day, running 37:49.71 to place 12th after being seeded 18th.  Gong allowed her time off from injury, and the heat, get to her.  She fell off the lead pack at the halfway point and lost all focus, only placing 14th.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event for day one was the men's 4x400 Relay.  The quartet of States Lee '16, Kaba, Derek Barnes '16 and Danny Newman '17 were seeded 10th going into the race and only eight would make the finals on Saturday.  Starting out in lane eight, Lee, still coming back from his foot injury, led off with a hard fought 48.6, putting his team in sixth at the handoff.  Kaba started out well on the turn using the three turn stagger, ran a great tangent after the break and went from sixth to first by the 200 mark.  Kaba slowed, but held onto fourth at the handoff with his 47.9 leg.  Barnes went out hard moved into third and closed on the leaders with a magnificent 47.2.  Newman ran an excellent leg, but was tripped from behind halfway through the final turn, stumbling onto the rail, but got back on the track after falling off for a couple of steps, and still ran a 47.9.  However, the trip caused him to lose two places, giving his team a fifth place finish in 3:11.74, a new MIT record.  The second heat only had one team run a faster time, giving the Engineers the sixth fastest time and putting them in the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Kaba led off day two for MIT with the 110HH.  Seeded 18th with a 14.54, he knew it would take a spectacular race to make finals.  Kaba had a poor start, got behind immediately and was unable to make up the ground, finishing in 14.80 into a headwind for 14th place overall.
    
    
                  
    
    Lee was up next in the 400.  It had been nearly two months since Lee had run his 47.68 and only two weeks since returning from an ankle injury that put him out for two and a half weeks.  At his best he was seeded ninth, but he was not at his best.  The senior gave a good go, although he may have been on the negative side mentally.  He finished in 48.80, failing to make finals.
    
    
                  
    
    The final competitor on day two was Bailey Tregoning '19.  The freshman was seeded 17th at 2:10.84, but given her rate of improvement, making finals was a definite possibility.  The past three weeks she had won New England Division III, earned second place at All New Englands out of the slow section and won ECAC's.  There was no doubt the rookie was nervous, but she seemed in control.  The first lap was 64, well within the wheelhouse of Tregoning, but she thought the pace was much faster.  On the backstretch when she began to move up in the field and the leaders were responding in kind, she panicked, got scared and tightened up because of it, finishing in a dismal 2:17.05.
    
    
                  
    
    On the final day of competition, the Triple Jump led off the competition for Tech.  Arinze Okeke '17 entered as the third seed while Carrington Motley '16 and Billy Ruschel '18 were seeded 10th and 11th respectively.  Ruschel was in the first flight and had the best series of his young life, topping out at 48-5 1/2, a new PR and #4 on the MIT all-time list,  winning his flight. Okeke launched a 48-7 1/2 in the second flight to move him to fourth overall and a new PR of his own, moving to #2 on the MIT list.  Motley had a fine series but could not make finals with his 47-1 effort.  Both Ruschel and Okeke continued to jump well, but were trying too hard to jump far instead of relaxing and competing, so neither improved.  Okeke stayed in fourth to match his indoor finish, but Ruschel fell back to eighth to earn his first All America honor.
    
    
                  
    
    While this was going on, Kaba was about to start the 400IH.  With a horrible start and stuttering every hurdle, somehow he still managed to run 52.46 and place seventh for his first individual All America award.
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen was up next in her 400IH final.  For some reason, she also got out slow, came up on the wrong leg on the first hurdle and continued to stutter most of the hurdles.  She pushed the final 100 to move up to fifth in 61.89.
    
    
                  
    
    Tre Albritten stood up at the start of the 200, was dead last in the first 10 meters and seemed to give up, running 23.11, but still placing seventh.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event for MIT was the men's 4x400 Relay.  States Lee was in lane two and ran a solid leg, putting MIT in about sixth place in 48.4.  Kaba did not go out with the vigor he exercised on Thursday and it showed as he came in with a much slower 48.5 split with his team in fifth place.  Derek Barnes was in limbo but closed well to put his team in fourth with his 48.3.  Danny Newman took the baton and tried to make up ground but the top three teams were too far ahead. At the end of the final turn, two teams ran past Newman even though he ran a 47.7 split.  The final time was 3:13.19, good for sixth place.
    
    
                  
    
    The men ended up with 13 points, putting them in 22nd place overall.  The women netted nine points for 31st place.  Overall, the Engineers came away with eight All America honors for the men and two for the women.  Given the number of injuries the Engineers sustained this year it was a very successful finale.

    ### Engineers Claim New England Division III Titles                  
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 5-7, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    Despite the injuries thoughout the season and the mental and physical fatigue from last week's championship, MIT held up better than everyone else as they successfully defended their New England Division III titles; the women winning their fourth in succession while the men won their third in a row and fourth in five years.  The men totally dominated the opposition, winning five events and scoring 176.5 points, over than a hundred more than Bates College, the second place team.  The women dominated in parts, but more or less won by default as no team, including MIT (with the exception of the distance runners), seemed to want the championship badly enough.  The Engineers scored 123.5 points, 37 more than runner-up Williams College.
    
    
                  
    
    While MIT was battling the injuries more than other teams, many teams were in final exams, and all teams were trying to come back after challenging conference championships the weekend before.  While MIT is also in the midst of final projects as they approach the final week of classes, nothing was going to stop them on day one of the championship.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT had one entry in the Decathlon, Luke Gray '18, seeded fifth in the competition.  Gray did not have the best performances in the speed events (100, 110HH, 400), but did quite well in the field events and 1500 despite a very irritated achilles tendon which made it very difficult in the Pole Vault and Javelin, the eighth and ninth events of the competition.  Gray finished in fourth place to put MIT two points up in their quest for victory.
    
    
                  
    
    The other three event finals on Friday were the Long Jump, Hammer Throw and 10K.  In the Long Jump, MIT was seeded for six points.  With the colder than normal temperatures (55 degrees) and rain going from drizzle to pouring throughout both days of competition, great performances were few and far between.  Arinze Okeke '17 took advantage of the situation, jumping 21-11 1/2 for second place.  Carrington Motley '16 added a 21-9 effort, good for sixth place and a total of 11 points.  The women one upped the men.  They were seeded for 17 points and scored exactly that.  Haley Strouf '18 led the trio of super sophomores to a 1-3-8 finish.  Strouf jumped three personal bests during the competition, eventually winning on the final jump with an 18-8 performance-a mark that should get her into the NCAA Division III Championship in three weeks.  Nneoma Okonkwo '18 jumped 18-5 1/4 for third and Hannah Chen '18 placed eighth at 17-5 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Hammer the men did not score, and the women again got exactly what they were seeded for, second place and eight points.  Jackie Vahey '17 threw 162-6 in the wet circle.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event of the night was the 10K.  The women raced first, seeded for an amazing 21 points, they knew that would require a top effort, particularly since many individuals in the race ran earlier in the season just to qualify, not necessarily their best effort.  Danielle Poto '16 from Bridgewater State College took the lead after an initial lap of 88 seconds, dropping an 84 to spread the field and continued to hammer out a challenging pace through a 5:45 first 1600 and proceeded to pick it up when it was obvious she was not shaking Mary Eccles '18 and Nicole Zeinstra '16. At the 2400 mark, Zeinstra fell off the pace, but Eccles remained steady as they ran a 5:42 second and third 1600.  Running sub 18:00 through 5K, it was obvious Eccles was having a great race.  A 4:47 fourth 1600 put Eccles in a bit of distress as she fell off the pace of Poto, but never by much.  Running 5:53 and then 5:51, Eccles stayed within three or four seconds until the final 400 where her 86 dropped her back seven total seconds but a PR of more than a minute with a 36:06.03 for second place, a mark that will certainly qualify her for Nationals.  Zeinstra held onto fifth in 37:39.67, Jenny Xu '19 ran 37:44.41 for sixth and Camila Thanos '19 placed seventh in 38:12.67.  The excellent effort produced 17 points, four fewer than the seeds predicted.
    
    
                  
    
    The men were seeded for 24, truly a tall order. Unlike the women's race, the pace was quite casual with regard to national qualifying performances.  The leaders ran 5:12 pace for the first 4800 and then the pace picked up suddenly to sub 5:00 pace.  Through 4800 all MIT runners were with the leaders, but with the increase in pace the pack started to string out.  By 6400 meters, Benji Xie 'G, Josh Rosenkranz '19 and Daniel Weiss '19 were there at 20:34 while Brian Gilligan '17 was only two seconds back.  Another 4:58 1600 still did not shake out the top six runners.  With 800 to go Xie was feeling it and took off.  He dropped a 2:15 final 800 to pull away with the victory by over five seconds with his 31:25.09.  Rosenkranz finished in third in 31:34.09, within eight seconds of the MIT freshman record.  Weiss was fourth in 31:39.25 and Gilligan placed seventh in 32:01.64.  The 23 points was about as good as could be hoped for, putting them up five points after the first day of competition.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two for the women did not begin well as a series of poor performances put the women in a big deficit.  Fortunately, Williams College, the only team with a solid chance of taking out the Engineers were not doing very well either, but they were doing better than MIT.  In the Pole Vault, a traditionally strong event for MIT, Tech was supposed to garner 15 points, but only came away with six and a half as Sherry Wan '16 tied for fourth at 10-11 3/4 and Jen Tylock '17 managed a seventh place at 10-6.  At the same time, Natalie Alper '17 could not shake off hamstring issues as she placed eighth at 5-2 1/2 when she had been seeded fourth.  Even the events that appeared to go pretty well for Tech did not go as well as perceived.  In the Shot Put, seeded for 18 points, Isabella Stuopis '16 led Vahey and Slutsky to a 3-4-5 finish for 15 points, throwing 39-5 1/4, 39-5 and 39-4 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    Things were not any better on the track as the women started off with the 4x100 Relay since both Steeplechasers have been injured since the indoor season.  The women just seemed down mentally as Okonkwo ran a slow first leg, had difficulty catching Strouf who had to slow in order to receive the baton. Nothing improved in the final two legs as MIT, seeded fifth did not place at all.
    
    
                  
    
    During this time the men were bringing a much better attitude and performing accordingly.  Seeded fifth in the 4x100, Richard Lu '16, Michael Kaba '16, Chris Sweeney '18 and Tre Albritten '18, finished in a close second despite switching out two legs and Sweeney catching Albritten before the exchange zone and before he reached full speed.  The time was not their best but a fine 42.45.  In the Steeplechase, seeded to place third and fourth, Aidan Gilson '19 continues to improve as he ran a 12 second PR to finish in second in 9:23.50.  Unfortunately Ben Freed '18 did not come through to earn a place.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were more up than down once the 1500 started, but not by much.  Maryann Gong '17, managing a stress reaction as she tries to prepare for Nationals, was not seeded to score in the 1500, but ran a conservative 4:35.18 good for fourth place and five more points than seeded. 
    
    
                  
    
    Kendra Knittel '17, not seeded to score in the 400, placed eighth in 59.07 to add one more point.  However, Chen did not make finals in the 100HH and she was seeded sixth.  Okonkwo, seeded to place sixth in the 100, lost a point, finishing seventh in 12.74.
    
    
                  
    
    In these same events, the men were again doing well for the most part.  With no 1500 entry they could not score, but earned their expected 11 points in the 110HH as Kaba and Sweeney placed 3-4 in 14.86 and 15.04, a PR for Sweeney.  Only seeded for six points in the 400 with the number one seed, States Lee '16, out with a severe tendonosis, Danny Newman '17 and Derek Barnes '16 placed third and fifth respectively in 49.33 and 49.47 for 10 points.  Albritten, with his poor start, managed to pass one runner in the finals to finish seventh in 11.05, but was seeded for sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    The big event for both genders was the 800.  Bailey Tregoning '19 was seeded fourth in the women's race and Jarod Wilson '19 was not seeded as he missed the past three weeks with a stress reaction. Tregoning ran with the leaders from the start, coming through the 400 in 68.2.  On the backstretch she took the lead, powering to a 2:14.11 finish and a new MIT Freshman Record.  Wilson, having not run for three weeks other than two short workouts, was in the second of three sections and knew he would have to post a very fast time to beat those in the top section.  Following along in the first lap he split 55.0.  As the pace slowed Wilson picked up the pace, taking the lead in the final 250.  As he came to the finish his lack of endurance work was evident as he could not quite hold it, finishing second in his section in 1:52.47.  Overall he ended up fifth, but that was four more points than MIT was counting on.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Discus, Cody Bratten '18 finished second with a throw of 150-3, one place higher than expected.  Vahey did not win the Discus as expected and teammate Slutsky beat her, claiming second and third at 137-9 and 137-8.  The women earned 14 points while seeded for 16.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Men's Pole Vault, the men held their own.  Scott Cameron '19 came through with a second place 14-9 performance.  Marshall Wentworth '16 earned seventh place at 14-3 1/4 and Ben Schreck 'G tied for eighth, also at 14-3 1/4 to cumulatively score one and a half points more than they were seeded.
    
    
                  
    
    While the men's meet was already out of reach, the triple jumpers put it out of sight.  Even though they were seeded for an unrealistic 27 points, they managed 28.  Okeke won with a jump of 46-11 3/4.  Billy Ruschel '18 was second at 46-10 1/4, Angel Echevarria '16 fourth at 46-2 1/2, Motley fifth at 46-2 and Ryan Prinster '18 eighth at 44-9.
    
    
                  
    
    With five events to go on the track, and not knowing how many points Williams earned in the Discus, and the Triple jump still going on, a strong event for Williams, the women needed every point they could get.  Chen, seeded first, placed third in the 400IH despite being assigned lane one, a very poor lane in the hurdles.  Her 61.78 was her season best. However, Williams scored 11 points, three more than expected.
    
    
                  
    
    Knittel, seeded an unrealistic wind-aided fifth in the 200, nevertheless finished in seventh with a 25.79.  A fine outing for the sprinter.
    
    
                  
    
    Not wanting to double back the 10K runners from the night before into the 5K, the quartet of Gong, Eccles, Zeinstra and Xu were prepared to do what was necessary for their team, and with the knowledge at hand it appeared to be necessary.  At the same time, MIT was scrambling for healthy legs in the 4x400 and 4x800 relays, but was not succeeding to field a team that could score points in the 4x800 and it would be close in the 4x400.  The 5K began fast with a 5:31 first 1600.  Gong went with the leader and Eccles and Zeinstra were working together back at 5:37.  Xu started in the back and was working with a group that could score but was pretty far back at 5:43.  The pace slowed to 5:40 pace for Gong and the leader and 5:46 for Eccles and Zeinstra. With 1000 to go, Gong eased out, running 2:38 and then a 39 to win by 20 seconds in 17:22.16.  Eccles finished third in 17:46.71 and Zeinstra fifth in 17:54.26.
    
    
                  
    
    During the race it was discovered the Williams' triple jumpers finished 1-2 and earned a sixth in the Discus.  However, with the 20 points in the 5K by MIT, it was determined Williams could not catch MIT even if they won the final two events; the 4x400 and 4x800 relays, so MIT pulled both teams and closed business for the day.
    
    
                  
    
    The men finished up in style.  First Kaba and Sweeney again represented MIT, this time with a 2-7 finish in the 400IH.  Kaba ran 54.07 while Sweeney was timed at 55.49.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 200, Albritten had the time to make up for his start as he is clearly the fastest in New England at top speed.  His first place finish was timed in 21.69.  Newman supported with a fifth place finish in 22.21.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 5K, Tech pulled two of the three 10K runners returning for the 5K, but Weiss wanted to race, joining the fresh Dennis Maloney '19 and Rory Beyer '17.  Maloney, not particularly liking the 3:40 first 1200 stroll, picked up the pace to 70 per quarter, first stringing out and then dropping all competition.  Looking as if he could have had lunch while doing so, the freshman ran 4:50, 4:40 and 4:48 before closing in 33 to win in 14:51.17.  Beyer ran a PR in his second ever 5K, placing fourth in 15:00.81.  Weiss just missed out on scoring but still ran 15:19.33.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers wanted to go for the 4x400 win, but without Lee it was going to be a task.  Kaba volunteered to join Wilson, Barnes and Newman to go for the victory.  Unfortunately, the mind was stronger than the body and Kaba could only produce a 50.3 after the two hurdle events.  Wilson showed he has not lost much speed as he ran 49.2.  Barnes was forced to race hard and responded with a 49.2 of his own to give Newman the lead, which he held with a 49.4 for a cumulative time of 3:17.40.
    
    
                  
    
    Gilson joined three fresh teammates for the 4x800 Relay. Nathan Munet '19 led off with a 1:58.7.  Gilson went out in 56.8, but died, running 1:59.9.  Chris Mutty '19 ran an excellent leg, finishing in 1:58.1 to put MIT in a good position to score.  Henry Tareque '17 held on nicely, running 1:59.3 to give MIT sixth place in 7:56.10.
    
    
                  
    
    The next two weekends MIT will back off of trying to win championships as they recover and try to prepare for the NCAA Division III Championship.  Next week, those competing will travel to Southern Connecticut State University on Friday and Saturday for the NEICAAA Championship.

    ### Tech Performs Well - Setting Two Varsity and Two Freshman Records                  
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 13-14, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    After two weeks where the MIT Men's and Women's Track & Field teams put together championship victories at the NEWMAC Conference and New England Division III Regional meets, they needed to back off for a couple of weeks as they prepared for the NCAA Division III Championship.  The NEICAAA Championship was the first of those preparation weeks.  This meet is unique in that all three NCAA Divisions in New England compete against each other for the title.  This particular year the meet was in conflict with the IC4A Championship, an even larger meet that includes most of the teams in the NEICAAA meet.  Most teams went to the NEICAAA Championship but there was no doubt the overall quality of this meet was less than in other years.
    
    
                  
    
    Even though MIT left some of their top athletes at home to rest or heal, they brought enough weapons to take fourth in the men's meet with 56 points while the women took fifth place with 46 points.  The amazing part, even with leaving some of their best athletes at home the men accomplished this feat with only 16 people while the women did it with only nine athletes.
    
    
                  
    
    The men brought a balanced attack that was led by two victories.  On Friday night, three of Tech's distance runners were going to attempt qualifying for Nationals in the 10K. Although the competition did not help with a fast enough pace, and the MIT runners were still feeling the effects of the previous two weeks of 5K's and or 10K's, they gave it their best shot.  Benji Xie 'G, after winning the 10K at the New England Division III Championship, topped that by pulling away from the competition with two miles to go.  His fifth mile was a 4:56 and the sixth a 4:49 as he finished it off with a 71 for a victory in 30:48.41, a personal best.  Dennis Maloney '19 placed third while setting the MIT Freshman record in 31:16.23.  Daniel Weiss '19 added a point with an eighth place finish.
    
    
                  
    
    Also on the first night, Arinze Okeke '17 jumped a personal best of 23-1 1/4 in the Long jump to place fifth.  Unfortunately he had one jump significantly farther, but his fist was placed behind him in the pit, killing the jump.
    
    
                  
    
    Most of MIT's entries on Friday qualified for the finals the next day.  Michael Kaba '16 led the way, qualifying for both the 110HH and 400IH.  Chris Sweeney '18 qualified for the 400IH with a PR of 53.65, and although he did not qualify in the 110HH, he did set a personal best of 14.94.  Danny Newman '17 qualified in the 400, matching his personal best of 48.97.
    
    
                  
    
    The women had a strong first day as well.  Jackie Vahey '17 led the way with a third place in the Hammer Throw.  Vahey moved up two spots on the NCAA Division III list to number 18 with her PR of 170-1.  Ariela Slutsky '18 did not place but threw a big personal best of 154-9.
    
    
                  
    
    Nicole Zeinstra '16, feeling her 10K / 5K double from the week before was not able to mount a quality qualifying performance although she gave it her best effort.  Nevertheless she placed fifth in 37:36.37.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Long Jump, Nneoma Okonkwo '18 placed fourth at 18-3 3/4 and Haley Strouf '18 took seventh place at 18-1 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    On Saturday, the men started strong and just kept going. The 4x100 Relay team of Sweeney, Kaba, Newman and Tre Albritten '18 ran a season best of 41.74 to place fifth and move to #24 on the NCAA list.  If they can drop another .3 they should make the qualifying field.
    
    
                  
    
    The members of the 4x100 came back and added quite a few points for the cause.  Kaba, having run 14.59 in the trials of the 110HH, made up for a poor start and placed sixth in 14.68. Newman was up next, earning sixth place in the 400 with a 49.09.  Three events later, Kaba and Sweeney were back in the 400IH.  Kaba, getting a good headwind on the homestretch the way he likes it, powered past his competitors to win in a new MIT record of 52.18.  Sweeney added a 54.26 effort for seventh place.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, Cody Bratten '18 threw a PR in the Discus to claim fourth place with a throw of 156-6.  If the sophomore can add three more feet he should make Nationals. Okeke came back in the Triple Jump, adding an eighth place with his 46-11 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event for the men was the 4x400 Relay.  With Kaba's foot bothering him, Jarod Wilson's '19 stress reaction putting him on the shelf, and already missing States Lee '16 to injury it was time to try a new lineup.  Albritten, typically a short sprinter, would lead off, followed by Sweeney, then Derek Barnes '16, and anchored by Newman.  Albritten did not appear to be into the race mentally, running far from his best with a 50.3 opening leg.  Sweeney, running his first 400 race at MIT without hurdles, absolutely hammered the first 200, making up at least 15 meters on the field.  He held on well in the final 100 into the wind, running 48.8.  Barnes ran an excellent, well paced leg as well, keeping MIT in the thick of things with a 48.7.  A poor handoff dropped MIT to fourth but Newman made up for it and then held on in the final straight to finish in third in a season best 3:16.73.  Tech will have to drop two more seconds at least in the final meet if they hope to qualify for Nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    The women in day two performed very well.  Although only represented in two track events they made the most of it.  Hannah Chen '18, having run the fastest time in the trial of the 400IH at 61.39, finished third in the finals with a 62.36.  Even though she started well and hit 17 steps on the backstretch she lost a lot of ground.  In the final 100 she made up the places, having her best last 100 ever, but it was not enough to set a PR.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 800, Bailey Tregoning '19 was in the second fastest of the sections, but was fortunate enough to have two opponents set a strong opening 400 of 64 seconds.  With the place slowing in the third 200, Tregoning prepared to take the lead and did so in the final 200 as she powered home in a personal best of 2:11.51, a new MIT Varsity and Freshman record.  Her performance was good for second place overall.  She is currently ranked 19th on the NCAA list with one week to go and 22 individuals making the final field.
    
    
                  
    
    Slutsky figured if one PR was a good thing, then more must be better.  In the Shot Put, although she missed placing by one place, she threw 42-10 3/4 for a big personal best.  In the Discus, she continued the trend, this time placing fourth with a big PR of 141-3.  Vahey added a fifth place at 139-8.
    
    
                  
    
    Sherry Wan '16 added the final points for Tech, placing third in the Pole Vault at 11-7 3/4.  She will need to clear at least 12-2, possibly 12-2 1/4 in her final meet if she is to make the NCAA field.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, those needing the opportunity will travel to Westfield State University for the ECAC Division III Championship for a final effort at qualifying.  This meet, held on Wednesday and Thursday as Thursday is the final day to qualify for the NCAA Championship, is also in the middle of MIT's final exam week.

    ### MIT Defends NEWMAC Titles

    April 30, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    The number of injuries and illnesses the MIT Track & Field teams have had to endure this season is unprecedented in the program's rich history, and while it may have slowed the progress of the championship machine, it has not stopped it.  The popular catch phrase "next person up" perfectly describes the spirit with which the men's and women's teams compete.  While the men steamrolled the competition at the NEWMAC Conference Championship, winning with a total of 304.5 points, 135 points more than runner-up WPI.  The women, low in numbers even without the injuries, persevered to win 201.5 to 174.5 to runner-up WPI.  This was the 16th consecutive title for the men and the eighth in a row for the women.
    
    
                  
    
    Both the men and women pulled two of their certain scorers from the 5K and the women pulled their 4x400 top seeded team while the men put in a B team, so the separation would certainly have been more, but the prevailing thought at the end of the meet was to be sure to be ready for next week's New England Division III Championship.
    
    
                  
    
    At the beginning of the meet hosted by the Coast Guard Academy it seemed the teams would be in store for a near perfect weather day.  Within thirty minutes of the start of the meet, the wind shifted direction, coming right off the water, dropping the wind chill to the low 40's.  Even more importantly, the Long Jump for the women and the Triple Jump for the men were now going into the wind, hurting those performances significantly.  While the marks were nothing special, MIT showed they came to play as the men placed 1-3-5-6 with Arinze Okeke '17 taking first place honors with a 21-10 1/4 performance, supported by Carrington Motley '16, Billy Ruschel '18 and Trevor McMichael '19.  At the same time on the track, Nicholas Waltman '18 led his teammates, Alex Knoedler '18 and Brian Gilligan '17, to a 2-3-4 finish in the 10K, running 32:47.02.  Using a 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 scoring format, and limited to four entries per event, per team, MIT took an early 42 points after two events.
    
    
                  
    
    Even the throws, which had not expected to produce a lot of points, got into the mix, producing 44 points.  Cody Bratten '18 won the Discus in a PR of 152-9, leading his teammates to a 1-4-6 finish, and also led his team to a 4-5-6 performance in the Shot Put.  Alex Noakes '16 placed third in the Hammer as his teammates supported with a fifth and eighth place.  Luke Gray '18, who added a sixth in the Javelin, had the performance of the meet for the men, placing third in the 110HH in 16.47, which gave MIT a 1-2-3 finish in that event.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Triple Jump, Okeke again won, this time with the wind at his back, with a leap of 47-11 3/4. It was also the only event in the meet where a team swept the top four places.  Ruschel  jumped a personal best for second place with a 47-9 1/4 performance.  The current triple jumpers on this team own four of the top seven marks all-time at MIT with Motley  at number two, (he did not even compete in the Triple this weekend in order to rest his legs for next week), Okeke at three, Ruschel at five and Angel Echevarria '16 at seven.  For his efforts, Okeke was voted the NEWMAC Male Field Athlete of the Year.
    
    
                  
    
    Cameron Scott '19 was the co-winner of the NEWMAC Male Rookie of the Year for his victory in the Pole Vault where he cleared a personal best 15-5 to lead his teammates to a 1-4-7 finish.
    
    
                  
    
    Taking the NEWMAC Male Runner of the Year was Michael Kaba '16.  Although Kaba returned from an injury that kept him out of competition the past two weeks, it was not obvious that he missed any time as he won the 110HH in 14.57, the 400IH in 54.78 and ran the second leg on the victorious 4x100 Relay that ran 42.11, the best mark of the season.  Supporting him in his victories, Chris Sweeney '18 was second in both hurdle events, the aforementioned Gray getting third in the 110HH and Richard Lu '16 adding a fourth in the 400IH.
    
    
                  
    
    Tre Albritten '18, in addition to anchoring the 4x100 Relay, won the 200 in 21.65 and took second place in the  100 in 10.86 despite his poor start.  Danny Newman '17, also a member of the 4x100 placed second in the 200 with a personal best 21.73.  States Lee '16, another member of the 4x100, and winner of the 400 in 48.62, pulled up in the 200 due to an injury to his foot.  That 400 was also a big event for Tech as they went 1-3-5-6 with Derek Barnes '16, Tom Frejowski '19 and Newman earning those places respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    Ben Freed '18, out with a broken bone in his foot since the cross country season, just started full impact running this week, but due to a dedicated committment to cross training was able to race this weekend in his primary event the 3000 Meter Steeplechase.  Aidan Gilson '19 led start to finish in running a personal best 9:35.21.  Freed got his feet wet, quite literally, with a second place 9:37.40, finishing in 36 for the final 200 over hurdles and the water jump, showing he had plenty in the tank.              
    
    
                  
    
    With all their milers injured or in the Steeplechase, Tech brought some distance runners down to the 1500 and they performed quite well, placing 3-4-6.  Josh Rosenkranz '19 led the way with a 4:02.56 while Benji Xie 'G and David Walter '18 earned the other two places.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 5K, Rory Beyer '17, also recently back from injury, needed to qualify for the New England Division III Championship next weekend so after MIT pulled Xie from the 5K, it fell on Dennis Maloney '19 to pace the way to a qualifying time.  After a slow first 200, Maloney took the lead.  After a first 1600 of 4:54, Maloney picked up the pace a bit for a 4:52 second 1600 and then broke the field with a 4:49 final 1600 to win in 15:11.32.  Beyer stayed with Maloney through 3600 meters, but did not fall off badly, running a qualifying time in placing second in 15:18.79.  The men won 11 of the 20 events en route to the title.
    
    
                  
    
    The women had depth in two areas, the field events and the distances and took full advantage of both.  There was fear that with only one entry in the 100, 100HH, 400 and 400IH that WPI would simply score too many points for MIT to make up.  While WPI did outscore MIT in the running events 139 to 94, which would not have been as bad if MIT had kept their two runners in the 5K and run the 4x400 Relay, MIT returned the favor in spades by outscoring WPI 109 to 39 in the field events.
    
    
                  
    
    The distance runners got things started in a positive way with a 21 point effort in the 10K.  Camila Thanos '19 took the lead in the first lap once it was apparent no one wanted it.  She started out at an appropriate pace with a 6:11 1600, abut then slowed to a 6:21 as her teammate, Bailee Margolis '19 shared the lead duties.  Thanos again picked up the pace in the third 1600 to a 6:09 and then a 6:10, which is when she broke her teammates.  Another pair of 6:09's left her with nearly a 17 second lead as she won in 38:34.29.  Margolis finished third in 39:03.21 and Darby LaPlant earned fifth place honors with a 39:43.04.
    
    
                  
    
    Jackie Vahey '17 led the team by winning the Hammer with a throw of 167-5, then shattered her own record in the Discus with a 153-1 performance in winning that event.  She also added a second place in the Shot Put at 40-0.  For her efforts Vahey earned the NEWMAC Female Field Athlete of the Year.  Even without one of their key members, who was sitting out due to lower back problems, the throwers scored 56 points in just the Hammer, Discus and Shot Put.  Isabella Stuopis '16 won the Shot at 40-7 1/2 and Ariela Slutsky '18 added a second in the Discus, and fourth place in both the Shot Put and Hammer.  Dana Balek '18 added a fourth in the Javelin at 110-8.
    
    
                  
    
    Although the team has no triple jumpers, they certainly make up for it with the Long Jump.  Nneoma Okonkwo '18 placed second at 18-6 1/2 with Haley Strouf '18 jumping a personal best 18-0 1/2 for third place. Hannah Chen added a fourth at 18-0 1/4 and Natalie Alper '17 placed seventh at 16-9 3/4.  This was the first time in program history that three jumpers went over 18' in the same meet.
    
    
                  
    
    While the team is still adjusting to the loss of Cimmy Virdi '16 to an ACL tear, her vaulter teammates still took four places.  The vault had started going with the wind, but then the wind reversed so the vaulters were all getting hammered by the head wind, which certainly affected the heights and mental attitudes leading to achieving those heights.  MIT succeeded where others did not, placing 1-3-6-7 with Sherry Wan '16 leading the way at 10-11 3/4.  Jen Tylock '17 cleared 10-6, Makenzie Patarino '19 10-0 and Madeleine Waller '17 9-6 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    No other victories were achieved on the track for the Engineers but they did run some strong performances.  Kendra Knittel '17 ran a PR of 58.55 in a perfectly paced second place finish in the 400, despite the strong wind.  She used the wind to her favor in the 200 to run a huge personal best of 25.16 for third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Okonkwo, added points on the track by placing fifth in the 100 with a 12.35 PR in the trials and then a 12.61 in the finals.  She also place seventh in the 200 in a new PR of 25.94.
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen '18 ran a season best in the 100HH to place second in 15.03 and then lost for the first time this season in the 400IH.  She did not accelerate going into the final hurdle while her opponent did as she lost in the final 20 meters in 63.01.
    
    
                  
    
    In the middle-distance events, with Maryann Gong '17 taking the meet off to let her injury heal up, were not up to  normal strength.  Bailey Tregoning '19 showed her inexperience as she took the lead going into the wind and too early in the race.  By the time she hit the homestretch into the wind a second time she had lost it all, barely holding onto third place in 2:19.02.  Clementine Mitchell '18 had her best race ever, focusing much better than in the past to place third in the 1500 in 4:46.50.  Nicole Zeinstra '16, running out of the slow section with no competition as it is the first time she was racing the 1500 this season, placed fifth in 4:52.20.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event for MIT with the results of the Discus and 200 still not in, all four 5K runners toed the line.  Thanos and Zeinstra were two of them and both were almost certain to place pretty high.  However, at the 1200 mark the scores came in and it was obvious MIT could not be caught so Coach Halston Taylor had both drop out of the race to save as much as possible for next weekend.  In the meantime, Mary Eccles '18 took the lead intending on running a hard pace despite the strong wind.  One opposing runner went with her, letting Eccles do all the work until 600 meters to go.  Eccles ended up in second with a 17:49.57 and Jenny Xu '19 ran 18:16.69 for third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Next weekend the women will be going for their fourth consecutive New England Division III Outdoor Track & Field Championship while the men will be going for their fourth title in five years.

    ### Okonkwo Sets Long Jump Record at Collier Invite
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 23, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    What started out as a cool and rainy meet, turned into an extremely nice day as MIT hosted the Sean Collier Invitational in their final tune-up prior to the start of the championship season.  In addition to looking for championship qualifying performances, the Engineers were also taking advantage of the non-scoring meet to rest some key individuals in order to have them at their competitive best as they enter the championships next weekend.
    
    
                  
    
    The best performance of the meet for MIT was the record breaking effort in the Long Jump by Nneoma Okonkwo '18. Even though there was no wind during the event, Okonkwo had a great series of jumps, but her 18-11 1/4 jump set the MIT record.  Also jumping a personal best for MIT was Haley Strouf '18, jumping 17-6 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    The throwers did their job, winning three events.  Jackie Vahey '17 won her two specialties, the Hammer and Discus Throws.  In the Discus she threw 137-0 1/4 and took the Hammer honors with a throw of 158-9 1/2.  Isabella Stuopis '16 won the Shot Put with a put of 41-4 3/4.  In all three events Ariela Slutsky '18 was the second best Tech thrower, finishing second in the Discus (132-0 1/4) and third in the Hammer (139-4 3/4) and Shot (38-7 1/4).
    
    
                  
    
    MIT competitors also took both vertical jumps, the High Jump and Pole Vault.  Natalie Alper '17 won the High Jump at 5-4 1/4.  Jen Tylock '17 claimed first place in the Pole Vault for the second meet in a row, clearing 11-2 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track MIT held most of their runners out.  However, Kendra Knittel '17 ran two season bests, running 12.68 in the 100 and 25.34 in the 200.
    
    
                  
    
    The top field performer for the men was Cody Bratten '18.  Bratten threw two outdoor personal bests, finishing second in the Discus at 149-7 1/4 and then fourth in the Shot Put at 44-5 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track there were many season and personal bests.  MIT moved  a few athletes to different events in order to increase their options in the championships.  In the short sprints States Lee '16 raced in the 100 Meters for the first time this season, running 11.25.  In the 200, Derek Barnes '16 delivered an excellent 22.49.
    
    
                  
    
    The 400 was probably the best event for Tech.  Barnes, prior to running the 200, won in a season best 49.13.  Danny Newman '17 delivered a second place in 49.45 and Tom Frejowski '19 ran a personal best of 49.98, breaking the 50 second barrier for the first time. Richard Lu '16 ran a season best of 56.22 in the 400IH.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 800, Nathan Munet '19 ran a very smart race and set a season best of 1:56.92.  Running for the first time since the indoor season, Chris Mutty '19 ran a 1:58.80.
    
    
                  
    
    David Walter '18 ran a PR in the 1500, racing well to finish in 4:02.67.  Walter had bookend quarters of 63 and what would have been a 62 as ran his final 300 in 46.  The middle 400's were too slow as the pack settled for 66-67 pace.
    
    
                  
    
    Aidan Gilson '19 continued to improve in the 3000 Meter Steeplechase.  He took the lead at the beginning and pulled away more as the race progressed, running 9:43.13 for a new PR.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT won the 4x100 Relay with the quartet of Newman, Lu, Tre Albritten '18 and Lee running 42.49 for a season best.  In the 4x400 Relay, Tech worked on finding depth as they ran a B team.  The foursome nearly pulled out the victory, losing by .01 second.  Frejowski opened with a fine 50.3 to give MIT the lead.  Munet added a 51.2, keeping MIT in front.  Gilson ran his first 400 of the year, splitting 51.0, but nearly losing the lead as the opposing runner ran 48.7. Henry Tareque '17 anchored after having raced to a season best of 51.34 in the open 400.  Tareque held his opponent off for the entire lap, but was out-leaned despite his 50.7 split.  The total time was 3:23.42.
    
    
                  
    
    Next weekend, the Engineers will travel to the Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT to defend their NEWMAC conference titles.  The men have won each year since 2000 and the women since 2009.

    ## MIT Begins Outdoor Season With National Level Performances
    
    
                  
    
     
    
    
                  
                  
                  
    
    March 25-26, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    Two weekends after the conclusion of the NCAA Division III Indoor Track and Field Championship, MIT began their outdoor season with three different meets.  On Friday, the pole vaulters and throwers competed at the San Diego State University Invitational at the conclusion of the Spring Break Trip to California.  Cimmy Virdi '16 led the way, finishing second with the nation's leading vault for Division III at 13-8 1/4.  Jen Tylock '17 also performed well, clearing 11-8 1/2.  All three of the men performed well with Ben Schreck 'G clearing 15-1, Scott Cameron '19 successfully getting over 14-7 1/2 and Marshall Wentworth '16 making 14-5 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    The throwers had a pretty solid opening day.  Jackie Vahey '17 dominated for the Engineers, throwing a PR of 42-10 3/4 in the Shot Put, 138-1 in the Discus and 151-3 in the Hammer.  Isabella Stuopis '16 put the shot 41-3 and Ariela Slutsky '18 threw 38-6 3/4.  Audrey Pillsbury '19 nearly took down the freshman record in the Hammer with her throw of 142-10.  For the men, Cody Bratten '18 was the only thrower for MIT and he had two strong performances, 148-9 in the Discus and 138-3 in the Hammer.
    
    
                  
    
    On Saturday morning, back in Massachusetts, the distance runners took advantage of the excellent 50 degree temperature at the Bridgewater State Invitational and made the attempt to qualify for the New England Division III Championship 10K as they may not race that distance again until that championship.  Maryann Gong '17, running her debut 10K was going after a solid NCAA qualifying performance.  Although the men and women were racing together, Gong had no one to run with as the women could not hold her pace and the back of the men's pack was too erratic in pace.  As she has a bad habit of doing, the junior started out too fast with an 80 second quarter.  However, she soon settled in at 85-86 second pace, hitting the 1600's in 5:39, 5:42, 5:40, 5:45, 5:45, 5:39 and finishing with an 81.  Her overall time of 35:31.22 will certainly earn her a spot at Nationals.  Mary Eccles '18 ran a nice personal best of 37:10.30.  She was followed by Nicole Zeinstra '16 in 37:20.33, Jenny Xu '19 in 37:54.59 and Camila Thanos '19 in 38:32.56.  Matt Deyo '16 was attempting to qualify for Nationals, but there was just no one for him to race with.  His first 1600 was solid in 4:53, but he soon slowed, running 5:04, 5:03, 5:05, 5:04 and 5:06, finishing in 31:27.58.  Racing together through 23 of the 25 laps, freshmen Daniel Weiss, Dennis Maloney and Josh Rosenkranz ran 31:31.47, 31:34.02 and 31:38.41 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    Also on Saturday, the rest of the technical athletes joined the vaulters (sans Virdi) and throwers in San Diego to compete in the Point Loma Nazarene Invitational.  This was a scored meet, but with only 16 athletes per gender competing for Tech, the ability to win the meet was severely hindered.  Nevertheless, the Engineers made a good run of it.  The women finished second in the 15 team field with 192.5 points and the men were third among the 14 teams with 185 points.  In beautiful 75-80 degrees and sunny skies, MIT competed to the best of their ability.  However, at the start of the meet, the mental side was not keeping up with the physical side.  
    
    
                  
    
    In the Long Jump only Arinze Okeke '17 performed at a reasonably high level as he took fifth place at 22-6.  MIT's next best jumper was Luca Cacopardo '18 at 21-4 1/4.  In the High Jump nothing was happening for Tech.  Natalie Alper had the best jump for the women at 5-1 3/4 and Milo Knowles '19 only managed 6-0 for the men.  On the track things did not go any better.  In their Steeplechase debut Aidan Gilson '19 and Leandra Zimmermann '19 ran reasonably fast performances on their abundance of talent, not their mental skills as they lost focus of the race very early on.  Gilson ran 9:55.91, placing sixth and Zimmermann placed third in 11:51.02.  The next event, the 4x100 Relay made it seem as though it was going to be a very long day at Point Loma. In the women's race, Annie Dai '18, coming back from months of inactivity due to a concussion, was unable to catch Alper, forcing Alper to nearly stop to receive the baton.  Kendra Knittel '17 and Hannah Chen '18 made up a lot of ground but only managed fifth in 49.99.  The men were next.  Tre Albritten '18 had an excellent opening leg and the handoff to Michael Kaba '16 went well.  Vying for first place, things then went wrong.  First, Danny Newman got out late, and also slow.  Kaba ran up on him and in the attempt to pass the baton it dropped, ending their race.
    
    
                  
    
    Just when it looked the bleakest, things started to turn around.  In the Hammer, Vahey led MIT to a 1-6-7 finish with a huge throw of 165-11.  Following Vahey were Pillsbury at 140-1 and Slutsky at 134-2.  The vaulters also took charge, placing 2-4-6 as Tylock took second place at 11-5 3/4.  Sherry Wan '16 claimed fourth, also at 11-5 3/4.  For the men, Kaba started things going in the right direction despite a sprained ankle he suffered on the botched handoff attempt in the 4x100.  He ran a personal best of 14.54 in the 110HH to claim third place.  Immediately after, States Lee '16 put down a 47.68 to place second in the 400.  Both Kaba's and Lee's performances should get them to Nationals.  MIT had support in both events with Chris Sweeney '18 at 15.34 in the 110HH and Newman ran 48.97 in the 400.
    
    
                  
    
    Once the ball got rolling in the right direction the momentum continued.  Chen jumped 18-1 to place fourth in the Long Jump, and at the same time ran 15.12 in the 100HH to place third.  Stuopis and Vahey went 2-3 in the Shot Put with both throwing 41-10 1/2.  Okeke led an assault on the Triple Jump, placing third with a huge leap of 48-4.  Okeke's performance should earn him a return trip to the NCAA Division III Championship in May.  Billy Ruschel '18 and Angel Echevarria '16 supported with fifth and sixth place jumps of 47-3 and 46-10 respectively.  Albritten then placed fourth in the 100 at 10.82 and third in the 200 in 21.49, a performance that should make Nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    Chen was not done as she took first place in the 400IH with a 62.80 performance.  Kaba matched her by taking the men's race in 53.89.  Sweeney and Cacopardo placed third and fourth, running 54.33 and 54.52.  
    
    
                  
    
    Vahey and company were not done.  Vahey won her second event, this time claiming first place honors in the Discus with a new MIT record of 140-10, breaking her own record.  Pillsbury took third at 124-0 and Slutsky was eighth at 120-0. Bratten placed second in his specialty, throwing the discus 147-11.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event of the evening, the men's 4x400 Relay, the Engineers were hoping for a National qualifying performance.  However, the gas was running low after 10 hours of competition.  Lee led off with a slowish 48.4, but gave Tech the lead.  Kaba's ankle finally started to give out, and even though the senior held the lead, he only ran 50.2.  Albritten's first effort in the 4x400 was solid, but not what he is capable of as he held onto the lead with a 49.7.  Newman ran a great anchor, holding off the other teams with his 48.5 to give MIT the victory in 3:17.08.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT will travel to Yale with part of the team to compete in a small invitational.

    ### Williams College Too Strong For Injured Engineers
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 16, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    MIT traveled to Williams College for a good old-fashioned dual meet, knowing they were low in numbers from injuries and illness.  Even though the Engineers were not seeded to win this type of competition, they put their best foot forward and competed like the champions they are.  Both the men's and women's teams are defending NEWMAC and New England Division III champions.  They know their strength is in the larger championships where quality is a bigger factor than quantity.  The plan was to fight for every point against an extremely talented and competitive Williams team in hopes of possibly pulling out a surprise victory, making the team even stronger if they are able to get a few of their injured back for the rematch at the NED3 meet in three weeks.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT did indeed compete very well and fought for every point, but the Ephs from Williams were just too strong and too deep. The scores for the women were Williams 111 and MIT 91 and 116 to 85 for the men. While every team has injuries to deal with, this year seems to be an anomaly for MIT with the number of top performers going out with everything from ACL tears, to stress reactions to concussions unrelated to the sport and even cases of mono.  With all the years of success to the program, including winning the past seven NEWMAC titles for both teams and winning the NED3 Championship the past four out of five years for both the men and women, this will certainly test the mettle of the program.
    
    
                  
    
    The women had a back and forth battle throughout the meet.  Having much more field event strength, MIT started well with a 1-2-3 finish in Hammer Throw.  Jackie Vahey '17 led the way with a new personal best of 168-8, currently the 10th best throw in the country for Division III. Vahey was supported by a new personal best of 147-6 from Ariela Slutsky '18 and a third place of 139-3 by Audrey Pillsbury '19.  The 10-1 lead using the 5-3-2-1 scoring format would build through the early events.  In the Long Jump, Tech pulled out another 1-2-3 finish when Nneoma Okonkwo '18 won with a jump of 17-10 3/4.  Hannah Chen '18 took second (17-7) and Haley Strouf '18 took third with a new PR of 17-6.  The Pole Vault looked to be going Williams way as Maggie Murphy '19 cleared 10-10 1/4 on her first attempt while Jen Tylock '17 and Sherry Wan '16 needed two and three attempts respectively to clear the height. At 11-2 1/4 both Tylock and Wan cleared on their first attempt while Murphy needed two attempts to put the Engineers back in front.  Tylock was the only one to improve from there as she won the event with a new personal best and solid national mark of 12-2 to move to number five on the all-time MIT list.  Kathleen Brandes '19 added a fourth place at 10-6 to give MIT a 29-5 lead.  The trend continued in the Javelin as Dana Balek '18 won with a 107-3 effort and Isabella Stuopis '16 added a fourth place.
    
    
                  
    
    As the first round of field events were finishing, the running events were starting.  This is where MIT was going to suffer.  With both freshmen steeplers dealing with nagging little injuries, the Engineers had no entries, giving Williams an uncontested 11 points.  The next event, the 4x100 Relay, Williams was a heavy favorite having run .8 faster.  With excellent handoffs between Okonkwo, Natalie Alper '17 and Kendra Knittel '17, and an incredible anchor leg by Hannah Chen, coming from way behind, Tech pulled out the victory 48.40 to 48.41.  The five points and 10 point swing gave MIT a 40-21 lead.  
    
    
                  
    
    The 1500 was one event where MIT could have done better than they did.  Maryann Gong '17, also working through an injury, did not run with the patience she needed, taking the lead after an initial pedestrian lap of 80 seconds.  Even though she ran a 76 then a 71 and finished with a 50 second final 300, which would have been a sub 2:20 final 800, Anna Harlean '18 targeted Gong and outkicked her for the victory.  Gong ran 4:37.40, and Clemmie Mitchell, who should have been able to get fourth, gave up in the final half of the race, running 4:53.81.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 100HH, Chen again came through, but could not quite get the victory.  Her season best 15.11 into a very slight head wind, earned her second place, but for the second event in succession Williams outscored MIT 8-3, making the score 46 to 37 in favor of MIT.  The trend continued with the next two events as MIT only had one entry in each event and both claimed second place.  First, Knittel  ran a season best 59.41 in the 400 and then Okonkwo ran a PR of 12.47 in the 100.  Williams was now in the lead 53 to 52.  
    
    
                  
    
    Back to the field events, MIT throwers went 1-2-3 again, this time in the Shot Put.  Slutsky again came through, this time improving nearly a meter to win with a throw of 41-3 3/4.  Stuopis was second at 40-0 1/2 and Vahey placed third at 39-5 1/4. However, in the Triple Jump, Tech had no entries, giving Williams another uncontested 11-0 sweep and a three point lead.  Natalie Alper had to come back from her 4x100 effort to try and clear 5-6, but was unable to do so, giving her a second place at 5-4 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    The 800 was next on the track.  Bailey Tregoning '19, working on raising her serum ferritin levels, is starting to regain the form that allowed her to set the MIT indoor freshman record for the 800. Williams was seeded to go 1-2-3, but Tregoning would have none of that. After a 68 first 400, she jumped into the lead with 200 to go, but Laney Teaford '17 responded, retaking the lead coming into the home straight to win in 2:13.73.  Tregoning finished second in 2:15.49, setting the MIT outdoor freshman record.  Gong was hoping to score some points but just missed with her 2:18.06.
    
    
                  
    
    Chen was back on the track, this time in her primary event, the 400IH. Starting more conservatively than usual, Chen ran a well paced race to win in a season and NCAA DIII best 62.01.  Even winning the event, MIT still fell further behind as Williams placed 2-3-4 to outscore Tech 6-5, making the overall score 87 to 73.
    
    
                  
    
    Even though, Vahey set another MIT record of 141-6 in the Discus and Slutsky responded with her third personal best of the day, claiming second with a 132-6, the meet was essentially over when Knittel was only able to manage a fourth place in the 200.  In the next to last event, Jenny Xu '19 ran her 5K debut, performing very well, earning second place with an 18:08.33, but Williams claimed 1-3-4.
    
    
                  
    
    Finishing the meet was the 4x400 Relay.  MIT not only wanted to close the meet with a victory, but also needed a fast time to get them into the fast section in the NED3 Championship.  Chen led off with a 59.0 leg to give Tech the lead.  Knittel ran 59.9, Alper a 60.6 and Tregoning a 59.9 to give MIT the victory at 3:59.61.
    
    
                  
    
    The men's meet was very similar in scoring with each team having their dominant events, with the depth of Williams winning out.  The men did not have the quality or depth in the throwing events, but the throwers held their own.  The threesome of Cody Bratten '18, Jon Fakkema '19 and Alex Noakes '16 scored 14 points in the Hammer, Discus and Shot Put compared to the Williams throwers earning 19 points. Fakkema threw three personal bests, placing second in the Discus at 134-0, third in the Hammer at 148-1 and 42-11 1/2 in the Shot. Bratten won the Discus at 148-6 and placed fourth in the Shot at 43-9 1/4.  Noakes claimed two fourth places; in the Hammer at 147-11 and in the Discus at 123-11.  In the Javelin, Luke Gray '18 threw 142-7 to finish third in the event.
    
    
                  
    
    The horizontal jumps was the most dominant area for Tech.  In the Long Jump, even though the Engineers were seeded three-four, Arinze Okeke '17 jumped 22-2 1/2 to take first place honors.  Billy Ruschel '18 had his best ever long jump, taking third place at 21-9 1/2.  Carrington Motley '16 did not place, missing fourth by two centimeters at 21-8.  MIT stepped up in the Triple Jump, taking 1-2-3-4-5. Motley reversed things, taking the victory at 47-9 1/4.  Ruschel supported with a second place at 46-10 3/4.  Okeke was third at 46-6 1/4, Angel Echevarria '16 fourth at 46-6 and Ryan Prinster '18 not scoring at 44-6.
    
    
                  
    
    In the vertical jumps, Scott Cameron '19 continued to be MIT's top vaulter, taking second at 14-11.  Marshall Wentworth '16 placed third at 13-5 1/4 and Gray was fourth at 12-11 1/2.  In the High Jump, Milo Knowles '19 took the only place for MIT, a third at 5-10.  Overall, Williams outscored MIT 46-42 in the field events.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Aidan Gilson '19 got things started with a well run 3000 Meter Steeplechase, taking the lead half-way through the first lap when it was clear that accelerating into the barriers was going to put him in the lead.  Opening up with a 5:04 first mile, Gilson ran 81's to run a PR of 9:43.91 for the victory.
    
    
                  
    
    Once again, the men's 4x100 failed to get the baton around, losing a chance at five points in a critical point in the meet.  In the next event, the 1500, Tech's top runners were all out with the exception of Gilson.  Benji Xie 'G did his best, but took the lead too soon and could not hold it.  Even though he ran 4:02.92 and Daniel Weiss '19 ran 4:03.69, MIT was shut out of the points.
    
    
                  
    
    Chris Sweeney '18 had a very strong day, first just missing out on first in the 110HH, running a PR of 15.28 and then coming back in the 400IH, again just missing out on first place as he ran another PR of 53.79.
    
    
                  
    
    Another area where MIT dominated was in the long sprints.  In the 400, States Lee '16 led a 1-3-4 finish with his 48.03 victory.  Derek Barnes '16 ran a season best 49.43 for third place and Danny Newman '17 took fourth in 49.58.  In the 200 MIT did one better, taking 1-2-3.  Tre Albritten '18, after getting second in the 100 in 10.85, returned to win the 200 in 21.84.  Lee took second in 22.36 and Newman third in 22.46.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 5K, Colin Cotton '16 of Williams opened up a lead after 3200 meters to win in 15:05.01.  Fellow freshmen Dennis Maloney and Josh Rosenkranz did not have the turnover to accelerate as much as Cotton and settled for second and third respectively.  After back to back 4:56 1600's, they ran 4:47 and 4:49 respectively in the final 1600 and closed with a 34 final 200 to run 15:14.13 and 15:15.97.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x400, MIT ran a unit of Tom Frejowski '19, Albritten, Talla Babou '19 and Barnes.  Frejowski backed up his open 50.29 with a 51.0 leadoff leg.  Albritten ran his best 400 to date, a 49.9 to give MIT a huge lead.  Babou did his job of holding the lead with his 52.0 and Barnes brought home the victory in 50.2.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT will take a handful of individuals in the 800 and 5K to the Larry Ellis Invitational at Princeton University on Friday evening and will also host a meet on Saturday at the Sean Collier Invitational.  That will be the final weekend before the start of the Championship season.

    ### MIT PERFORMANCES NOT UP TO ENGINEER'S STANDARD AT YALE INVITE
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 2, 2016              
    
    
                  
    
    Fresh off a weekend of outstanding performances, MIT's Track & Field team followed it up with a rather lackluster meet at the Yale Invitational. The non-scoring meet  was put together in just the past few weeks, involving partial teams from MIT, host Yale, Southern Connecticut State, New Haven, Brown and University of Birmingham from the UK.  The fact that most teams were not bringing all of their top athletes combined with the rainy, cold start to the day,probably took many of the Tech athletes out of their competitive mentality.  Another factor that affected the team was that all the jumps were moved to the indoor facility, which meant some athletes had to juggle their performances between jumping indoors and running outdoors.  Excuses can certainly be made, but the competition was good enough in most cases, there was virtually no wind, which in April in New England is a rarity, and it stopped raining shortly after the start of the meet.  It seemed something was missing from the typical MIT Track & Field attitude, and that seemed to affect their performances.
    
    
                  
    
    However, quite a few, particularly the women's throwers responded well.  Jackie Vahey '17 won the Discus and placed second in the Hammer, where she threw a personal best of 168-3, a solid national level mark.  Also throwing personal bests in those events were Ariela Slutsky '18, throwing 128-4 for second in the Discus, and Haley Strouf '18, who threw a PR of 128-3 for eighth place in the Hammer. Isabella Stuopis '16 won the Shot Put in a steady rain with a throw of 38-6 1/4 and Audrey Pillsbury '19 threw a best of 36-1 1/4 for sixth place.  Also in the throws, Dana Balek '18 threw a personal best of 114-4 for second place in the Javelin.
    
    
                  
    
    In the jumps, Scott Cameron '19 jumped a season best of 14-11 in the Pole Vault in claiming second place, while Leah Schmitz '16 cleared a season best of 10-2 for sixth place.  Trevor McMichael '19 jumped a season best of 20-11 3/4 to place fourth in the Men's Long Jump.  Katherine Prutz '18 jumped 5-3 1/4 for a huge outdoor best, taking fourth place in the High Jump.  In the Women's Long Jump, Nneoma Okonkwo '18 won with a personal best of 17-11 3/4, while Strouf again came through, jumping a PR of 17-2 1/4 to claim second. Other winners in the jumps included Cimmy Virdi '16 in the Pole Vault at 13-1 1/2 and Billy Ruschel '18 in the Triple Jump at 46-4 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track there were very few highlights for the Engineers.  Standing out was Jarod Wilson '19, who won the 800, running a casual 1:55.62 and then returning to lead off the 4x400 Relay with a 48.0 lead off leg.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500, Clemmie Mitchell '18 and Leandra Zimmermann '19 went 1-2 in the slow section, recording times of 4:50.27 and 4:51.21 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    The men's 4x100 Relay, comprised of Richard Lu '16, Michael Kaba '16, Tre Albritten '18 and Luca Cacopardo '18 won in a fine time of 42.97.
    
    
                  
    
    Chris Sweeney '18 had a strong day in finishing second in the 110HH in 15.37 and then winning the 400IH in 54.83.
    
    
                  
    
    Next weekend, Tech will be at home against strong squads from Bates College, RPI and Tufts University.  They will need to step up their game to come out ahead against those very competitive teams.
