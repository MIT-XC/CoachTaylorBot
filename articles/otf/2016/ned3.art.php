                  <h3>Engineers Claim New England Division III Titles                  </h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>May 5-7, 2016              </p>
              <p>Despite the injuries thoughout the season and the mental and physical fatigue from last week's championship, MIT held up better than everyone else as they successfully defended their <a href="ned3.php">New England Division III</a> titles; the women winning their fourth in succession while the&nbsp;men won their third in a row and fourth in five years.&nbsp; The men totally dominated the opposition, winning five events and scoring 176.5 points, over than a hundred more than Bates College, the second place team.  The women dominated in parts, but more or less won by default as no team, including MIT (with the exception of the distance runners), seemed to want the championship badly enough.&nbsp; The Engineers scored 123.5 points, 37 more than runner-up Williams College.</p>
              <p>While MIT was battling the injuries more than other teams, many teams were in final exams, and all teams were trying to come back after challenging conference championships the weekend before.&nbsp; While MIT is also in the midst of final projects as they approach the final week of classes, nothing was going to stop them on day one of the championship.</p>
              <p>MIT had one entry in the Decathlon, Luke Gray '18, seeded fifth in the competition.&nbsp; Gray did not have the best performances in the speed events (100, 110HH, 400), but did quite well in the field events and 1500&nbsp;despite a very irritated achilles tendon which made it very difficult in the Pole Vault and Javelin, the eighth and ninth events of the competition.&nbsp; Gray finished in fourth place to put MIT two points up in their quest for victory.</p>
              <p>The other three event finals on Friday were the Long Jump, Hammer Throw and 10K.&nbsp; In the Long Jump, MIT was seeded for six points.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the colder than normal temperatures (55 degrees) and rain going from drizzle to pouring throughout both days of competition, great performances were few and far between.&nbsp; Arinze Okeke '17 took advantage of the situation, jumping 21-11 1/2 for second place.&nbsp; Carrington Motley '16 added a 21-9 effort, good for sixth place&nbsp;and a total of 11 points.&nbsp; The women one upped the men.&nbsp; They were seeded for 17 points and scored exactly that.&nbsp; Haley Strouf '18 led the trio of super sophomores to a 1-3-8 finish.&nbsp; Strouf jumped three personal bests during the competition, eventually winning on the final jump with an 18-8 performance-a mark that should get her into the NCAA Division III Championship in three weeks.&nbsp; Nneoma Okonkwo '18 jumped 18-5 1/4 for third and Hannah Chen '18 placed eighth at 17-5 1/2.</p>
              <p>In the Hammer&nbsp;the men did not score, and the women again got exactly what they were seeded for, second place and eight points.&nbsp; Jackie&nbsp;Vahey '17 threw 162-6 in the wet circle.</p>
              <p>The final event of the night was the 10K.&nbsp; The women raced first, seeded for an amazing 21 points, they knew that would require a top effort, particularly since many individuals in the race ran earlier in the season just to qualify, not necessarily their best effort.&nbsp; Danielle Poto '16 from Bridgewater State College took the lead after an initial lap of 88 seconds, dropping an 84 to spread the field and continued to hammer out a challenging pace through a 5:45 first 1600 and proceeded to pick it up when it was obvious she was not shaking Mary Eccles '18 and Nicole Zeinstra '16.&nbsp;At the 2400 mark, Zeinstra fell off the pace, but Eccles remained steady as they ran a 5:42 second&nbsp;and third 1600.&nbsp; Running sub 18:00 through 5K, it was obvious Eccles was having a great race.&nbsp; A 4:47 fourth 1600 put Eccles in a bit of distress as she fell off the pace of Poto, but never by much.&nbsp; Running 5:53 and then 5:51, Eccles stayed within three or four seconds until the final 400 where her 86 dropped her back seven total seconds but&nbsp;a PR of more than a&nbsp;minute with a 36:06.03&nbsp;for second place, a mark that will certainly qualify her for Nationals.&nbsp; Zeinstra held onto fifth in 37:39.67, Jenny Xu '19 ran 37:44.41 for sixth and Camila Thanos '19 placed seventh in 38:12.67.&nbsp; The excellent effort produced 17 points, four fewer than the seeds predicted.</p>
              <p>The men were seeded for 24, truly a tall order. Unlike the women's race, the pace was quite casual with regard to national qualifying performances.&nbsp; The leaders ran 5:12 pace for the first 4800 and then the pace picked up suddenly to sub 5:00 pace.&nbsp; Through 4800 all MIT runners were with the leaders, but with the increase in pace the pack started to string out.&nbsp; By 6400 meters, Benji Xie 'G, Josh Rosenkranz '19&nbsp;and Daniel Weiss '19 were there at 20:34&nbsp;while Brian Gilligan '17 was only two seconds back.&nbsp; Another 4:58 1600 still did not shake out the top six runners.&nbsp; With 800 to go Xie was feeling it and took off.&nbsp; He dropped a 2:15 final 800 to pull away with the victory by over five seconds with his 31:25.09.&nbsp; Rosenkranz finished in third in 31:34.09, within eight seconds of the MIT freshman record.&nbsp; Weiss was fourth in 31:39.25 and Gilligan&nbsp;placed seventh in 32:01.64.&nbsp; The 23 points was about as good as could be hoped for, putting them up five points after the first day of competition.</p>
              <p>Day two for the women did not begin well as a series of poor performances put the women in a big deficit.&nbsp; Fortunately, Williams College, the only team with&nbsp;a solid chance of taking out the Engineers were not doing very well either, but they were doing better than MIT.&nbsp; In the Pole Vault, a traditionally strong event for MIT,&nbsp;Tech was supposed to garner 15 points, but only came away with six and a half as Sherry Wan '16 tied for fourth at 10-11 3/4 and Jen Tylock '17 managed a seventh place at 10-6.&nbsp; At the same time, Natalie Alper '17 could not shake off hamstring issues as she placed eighth at 5-2 1/2 when she had been seeded fourth.&nbsp; Even the events that appeared to go pretty well for Tech did not go as well as perceived.&nbsp; In the Shot Put, seeded for 18 points, Isabella Stuopis '16 led Vahey and Slutsky to a 3-4-5 finish for 15 points, throwing 39-5 1/4, 39-5 and 39-4 respectively.</p>
              <p>Things were not any better on the track as the women started off with the 4x100 Relay since both Steeplechasers have been injured since the indoor season.&nbsp;&nbsp;The women just seemed down mentally as Okonkwo ran a slow first leg, had difficulty catching Strouf who had to slow in order to receive the baton.&nbsp;Nothing improved in the final two legs as MIT, seeded fifth did not place at all.</p>
              <p>During this time the men were bringing a much better attitude and performing accordingly.&nbsp; Seeded fifth in the 4x100, Richard Lu '16, Michael Kaba '16, Chris Sweeney '18 and Tre Albritten '18, finished in a close second despite switching out two legs and Sweeney catching Albritten before the exchange zone and before he reached full speed.&nbsp; The time was not their best but a fine 42.45.&nbsp; In&nbsp;the Steeplechase, seeded to place third and fourth, Aidan Gilson '19 continues to improve as he ran a 12 second PR to finish in second in 9:23.50.&nbsp; Unfortunately Ben Freed '18 did not come through&nbsp;to earn a place.</p>
              <p>The women were more up than down once the 1500 started, but not by much.&nbsp; Maryann Gong '17, managing a stress reaction as she tries to prepare for Nationals, was not seeded to score in the 1500, but ran a conservative 4:35.18 good for fourth place and five more points than seeded.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Kendra Knittel '17, not seeded to score in the 400, placed eighth in 59.07 to add one more point.&nbsp; However, Chen did not make finals in the 100HH and she was seeded sixth.&nbsp; Okonkwo, seeded to place sixth in the 100, lost a point, finishing seventh in 12.74.</p>
              <p>In these same events, the men were again&nbsp;doing well&nbsp;for the most part.&nbsp; With no 1500 entry they could not score, but earned their expected 11 points in the 110HH as Kaba and Sweeney placed 3-4 in 14.86 and 15.04, a PR for Sweeney.&nbsp; Only seeded for six points in the 400 with the number one seed, States Lee '16, out with a&nbsp;severe tendonosis, Danny Newman '17 and Derek Barnes '16 placed third and fifth respectively in 49.33 and 49.47 for 10 points.&nbsp; Albritten, with his poor start, managed to pass one runner in the finals to finish seventh in 11.05, but was seeded for sixth.</p>
              <p>The big event for both genders was the 800.&nbsp; Bailey Tregoning '19 was seeded fourth in the women's race and Jarod Wilson '19 was not seeded as he missed the past three weeks with a stress reaction.&nbsp;Tregoning ran with the leaders from the start, coming through the 400 in 68.2.&nbsp; On the backstretch she took the lead, powering to a 2:14.11 finish and a new MIT Freshman Record.&nbsp; Wilson, having not run for three weeks other than two short workouts, was in the second of three sections and knew he would have to post a very fast time to beat those in the top section.&nbsp; Following along in the first lap he split 55.0.&nbsp; As the pace slowed Wilson picked up the pace, taking the lead in the final 250.&nbsp; As he came to the finish his lack of endurance work was evident as he could not quite hold it, finishing second in his section in 1:52.47.&nbsp; Overall he ended up fifth, but that was four more points than MIT was counting on.</p>
              <p>In the Discus, Cody Bratten '18 finished second with a throw of 150-3, one place higher than expected.&nbsp; Vahey did not win the Discus as expected and teammate Slutsky beat her, claiming second and third at 137-9 and 137-8.&nbsp; The women earned 14 points while seeded for 16.</p>
              <p>In the Men's Pole Vault, the men held their own.&nbsp; Scott Cameron '19 came through with a second place 14-9 performance.&nbsp; Marshall Wentworth '16 earned seventh place at 14-3 1/4 and Ben Schreck 'G tied for eighth, also at 14-3 1/4&nbsp;to cumulatively score one and a half points more than they were seeded.</p>
              <p>While the men's meet was already out of reach, the triple jumpers put it out of sight.&nbsp; Even though they were seeded for an unrealistic 27 points, they managed 28.&nbsp; Okeke won with a jump of 46-11 3/4.&nbsp; Billy Ruschel '18 was second at 46-10 1/4, Angel Echevarria '16 fourth at 46-2 1/2, Motley fifth at 46-2 and Ryan Prinster '18 eighth at 44-9.</p>
              <p>With five events to go on the track, and not knowing how many points Williams earned in the Discus, and the Triple jump still going on, a strong event for Williams, the women needed every point they could get.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen, seeded first, placed third in the 400IH despite being assigned lane one, a very poor lane in the hurdles.&nbsp; Her 61.78 was her season best.&nbsp;However, Williams scored 11 points, three more than expected.</p>
              <p>Knittel, seeded an unrealistic wind-aided fifth in the 200, nevertheless finished in seventh with a 25.79.&nbsp; A fine outing for the sprinter.</p>
              <p>Not wanting to double back the 10K runners from the night before into the 5K, the quartet of Gong, Eccles, Zeinstra and Xu were prepared to do what was necessary for their team,&nbsp;and with the knowledge at hand it appeared to be necessary.&nbsp; At the same time, MIT was scrambling for healthy legs in the 4x400 and 4x800 relays, but was not succeeding&nbsp;to field a team that could score points in the 4x800 and it would be close in the 4x400.&nbsp; The 5K began fast with&nbsp;a 5:31 first 1600.&nbsp; Gong went with the leader and Eccles and Zeinstra were working together back at 5:37.&nbsp; Xu started in the back and was working with a group that could score but was pretty far back at 5:43.&nbsp; The pace slowed to 5:40 pace for Gong and the leader and 5:46 for Eccles and Zeinstra.&nbsp;With 1000 to go, Gong eased out, running 2:38 and then a 39 to win by 20 seconds in 17:22.16.&nbsp; Eccles finished third in 17:46.71 and Zeinstra fifth in 17:54.26.</p>
              <p>During the race it was discovered the Williams' triple jumpers finished 1-2&nbsp;and earned a sixth in&nbsp;the Discus.&nbsp; However, with the 20 points in the 5K by MIT, it was determined Williams could not catch MIT even if they won the final two events; the 4x400 and 4x800 relays, so MIT pulled both teams and closed business for the day.</p>
              <p>The men finished up in style.&nbsp; First Kaba and Sweeney again represented MIT, this time with a 2-7 finish in the 400IH.&nbsp; Kaba ran 54.07 while Sweeney was timed at 55.49.</p>
              <p>In the 200, Albritten had the time to make up for his start as he is clearly the fastest in New England at top speed.&nbsp; His first place finish was timed in 21.69.&nbsp; Newman supported with a fifth place finish in 22.21.</p>
              <p>In the 5K, Tech pulled two of the three 10K runners returning for the 5K, but Weiss wanted to race, joining the fresh Dennis Maloney '19 and Rory Beyer '17.&nbsp; Maloney, not particularly liking the 3:40 first 1200 stroll, picked up the pace to 70 per quarter, first stringing out and then dropping all competition.&nbsp; Looking as if he could have had lunch while doing so, the freshman ran 4:50, 4:40 and 4:48 before closing in 33 to win in 14:51.17.&nbsp; Beyer ran a PR in his second ever 5K, placing fourth in 15:00.81.&nbsp; Weiss just missed out on scoring but still ran 15:19.33.</p>
              <p>The Engineers wanted to go for the 4x400 win, but without Lee it was going to be a task.&nbsp; Kaba volunteered to join&nbsp;Wilson, Barnes and Newman to go for the victory.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the mind was stronger than the body and Kaba could only produce a 50.3 after the two hurdle events.&nbsp; Wilson showed he has not lost much speed as he ran 49.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Barnes was forced to race hard and responded with&nbsp;a 49.2 of his own to give Newman the lead, which he held with a 49.4 for a cumulative time of 3:17.40.</p>
              <p>Gilson joined three fresh teammates for the 4x800 Relay.&nbsp;Nathan Munet '19 led off with a 1:58.7.&nbsp; Gilson went out in 56.8, but died, running 1:59.9.&nbsp; Chris Mutty '19 ran an excellent leg, finishing in 1:58.1 to put MIT in a good position to score.&nbsp; Henry Tareque '17 held on nicely, running 1:59.3 to give MIT sixth place in 7:56.10.</p>
              <p>The next two weekends MIT will back off of trying to&nbsp;win championships as they recover and try to prepare for the NCAA Division III Championship.&nbsp; Next week, those competing will travel to Southern Connecticut State University on Friday and Saturday for the NEICAAA Championship.</p>
