                  <h3>Shaoul Sets MIT Triple Jump Record, MIT Brings Home Seven All America Awards</h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                </center>
              
              
              <p>May 24-26, 2018              </p>
              <p>MIT brought 10 women and six men to the the <a href="ncaa.res.pdf">NCAA Division III Outdoor Track &amp; Field Championship</a>, held at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse, with hopes of making it into the top 10 on the women's side and top 20 on the men's.&nbsp;To make it to this championship a student-athlete had to be ranked among the top 22 women&nbsp;/ 20 men entered in their event.&nbsp; Once here, only the top eight score&nbsp;and earn All America honors.&nbsp; MIT's hopes for either team&nbsp;would need some surprise outcomes to come to fruition.</p>
              <p>On day one, things did not start off in a manner that would help MIT's goal.&nbsp; Mary Eccles '18 was the first to compete for the Engineers.&nbsp; The 10K, Eccles event, was moved to 8:45 a.m. in order for the athletes to escape the extreme heat predicted for the original start time, which was three hours later.&nbsp; Eccles started out great, and looked as though she was ready to move up from her ninth place seed and earn her second All America award.&nbsp; However, after running back to back 5:49 miles, and just before the 4800 mark, Eccles pulled her parachute, putting in a 6:40+ mile.&nbsp; This was not her day, but the senior ended a marvelous season and truly inspirational career with a 17th place finish in 38:16.03.</p>
              <p>Cody Bratten '18 was up next, taking to the discus circle to try and put MIT on the scoreboard.&nbsp; Bratten, also seeded ninth entering the competition, had three decent throws, but nothing at the level that would get him into finals (top nine).&nbsp; He finished in 12th with&nbsp;a 156-7 performance.</p>
              <p>The women's Pole Vault was starting at about the time the Discus was ending.&nbsp;&nbsp;MIT had Jacqueline Ahrens '21 (seeded ninth) and Kari Stromhaug '19 (seeded 14th) in the competition.&nbsp; Stromhaug has earned All America honors in each of her competitive seasons at MIT and Ahrens, just a freshman, was also All American in her first season.&nbsp; The opening height was 11-5 3/4, which both cleared on their first attempt.&nbsp; That height knocked out two competitors and another one never showed for the competition.&nbsp; The next height 11-11 3/4 was cleared by both Stromhaug and Ahrens on their second attempt with six more vaulters not making the height.&nbsp; At 12-3&nbsp;1/2, Stromhaug cleared on her first attempt, but Ahrens needed three attempts.&nbsp; This height claimed six more victims, leaving seven who cleared it and the defending national champion who had yet to enter the competition.&nbsp; Stromhaug, the only one to have cleared 12-3 1/2 on her first attempt was winning the competition at that point.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, two cleared the next height and neither were Stromhaug or Ahrens.&nbsp; The defending national champion failed to make her opening height, giving Stromhaug third place and Ahrens a two-way tie for sixth.&nbsp; MIT was on the board with eight and a half points.</p>
              <p>The women's Discus was already underway and Ariela Slutsky '18, seeded 14th in the competition, was doing relatively well, having thrown 145-0 to finish second in the first flight.&nbsp; With 11 throwing in each flight, and only nine going to finals, Slutsky would have to beat at least four in the seeded flight, which is exactly what happened.&nbsp; The senior then improved to 145-5, but remained in ninth, not quite reaching All American as she did in 2017.</p>
              <p>It was time to get onto the track again with the women's 1500.&nbsp; MIT had both Marissa McPhillips '20 and Katie Bacher '20 in the field, seeded sixth and eighth respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both were in the second of two heats, with the top four in each and the next four fastest times moving on to the 12 person field&nbsp;final on Saturday.&nbsp; The fifth place runner in the first heat finished in 4:37.15, so as long as McPhillips and Bacher were either top four in their heat or top eight and faster than 4:37.15, they would be in the final.&nbsp; The initial pace of the second heat was slow with an opening 400 of 76 and 2:30 for the 800.&nbsp; Things still did not pick up significantly, but McPhillips and Bacher moved up in the crowded field to gain better position.&nbsp; With 300 to go&nbsp;McPhillips moved hard, catching the leaders with a final 400 of 70 to finish second in 4:36.74.&nbsp; Bacher, moving a little behind McPhillips, struggled in the final 50, falling from fourth to sixth, .04 from seventh.&nbsp; Her&nbsp;time of 4:37.63 was the final time to make it to the finals.</p>
              <p>Next up for MIT was the 400IH.&nbsp; The men were up first with Chris Sweeney '18, seeded 18th, representing MIT in lane four of the first heat.&nbsp; Sweeney got out well, struggled a bit on the fourth&nbsp;and fifth hurdles and took too long to recover.&nbsp; He finished well, having a solid homestretch but was only able to finish fifth in his heat with a 54.22, good enough for 14th overall.</p>
              <p>Hannah Chen '18, making her fourth trip to the NCAA Championship in the 400IH, was seeded fifth entering the competition.&nbsp; The senior was able to win her heat despite hitting some hurdles and stuttering badly on the homestretch, running 62.33 in the windy conditions.</p>
              <p>The final events for MIT on day one were the men's and women's 3,000 Meter Steeplechase.&nbsp; Jenna Melanson '20 was seeded eighth entering the competition and Aidan Gilson 12th.&nbsp; Gilson put himself in excellent position early in&nbsp;the trial.&nbsp; Even&nbsp;though the pace was slow (4:56 at the 1600), the pack was fairly spread out.&nbsp; Gilson grew too comfortable with the margin of separation and lost enough of his competitiveness that he started losing a lot of ground.&nbsp; With the top five in each heat and the next four fastest times advancing to the final, he was taking it a bit too casually.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having fallen back to fifth, the junior made a burst with 200 to go to move into fourth in 9:24.05, making finals on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The top seed was in Melanson's heat and she went out to the front with a strong start.&nbsp; Melanson, closed that gap over the first quarter, running in second with a group of five who had separated themselves from the rest of the pack.&nbsp; Nothing changed throughout the race and Melanson ran a very relaxed personal best of 10:41.37 to finish in a very close second, moving on to the finals.</p>
              <p>Day two was a very light day for the Engineers by comparison, but important in their quest to have a successful team finish.&nbsp; Alec Reduker '20 was the first to compete for MIT, entered in the High Jump as the eighth seed.&nbsp; Reduker had cleared 6-10 3/4 during the Spring Trip fresh off his All America performance at the Indoor NCAA Division III Championship.&nbsp; However, he then suffered a lower back injury that put him out for a few weeks with no practice or competition and then a guarded approach to championship preparation.&nbsp; The opening height was 6-4, which Reduker cleared with no problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;He then cleared 6-6 on his first attempt.&nbsp; However, at 6-8 he was unable to clear, ending his outdoor season.</p>
              <p>Later in the evening, after a three hour lightning delay, Bailey Tregoning '19 and Margaret Trautner '20 prepared for the 800.&nbsp; Tregoning, seeded ninth was in the first heat and Trautner, seeded 20th, was in the third heat.&nbsp; Making the finals required finishing among the top two in each heat or to be one of the next three fastest times.&nbsp; The first heat went out extremely fast, splitting the first 400 in 61.&nbsp; Tregoning knew it was too fast and was comfortable at 63 about ten meters behind a group of four runners.&nbsp; She ran a solid next 200, looking as if she might catch the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, but all too significant, Tregoning lost hope for about 100 meters, before reapplying herself and finishing well.&nbsp; Her 2:11.88 was seventh in her heat, ruling out the possibility of making finals.&nbsp;The second heat was also fast with the third place runner running 2:09.79, which meant in order for Trautner to make finals she would have to be one of the top two in her heat or be third and run faster than 2:10.18.&nbsp; Neither of those happened as Trautner only saw how fast everyone was running and lost hope.&nbsp; Her heat went out really slow, splitting 66, so no one qualified on time from that heat.&nbsp; Trautner finished 20th overall in 2:14.19.</p>
              <p>Saturday, the final day of competition and one that would be in the mid-90's all day, started with the Steeplechase.&nbsp; Gilson was up first for MIT.&nbsp; The pace was absolutely pedestrian at 5:00 for the first mile.&nbsp; At that point it picked up and Gilson did not respond to the increase in pace.&nbsp; However, despite the slow early pace, many did not keep up.&nbsp; Gilson faded from second to eighth, but fought for that final All&nbsp;America position and earned it in 9:16.04.</p>
              <p>It was now Melanson's turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;In complete contrast, the women's start was fast.&nbsp; Melanson had made the decision to go out with the leaders, but a little bit off of them if it was too fast.&nbsp; Well, they were very fast at 77 for the first quarter and she was 79, which was plenty fast enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;This put her in limbo between the first two and the four who were the chase pack.&nbsp; After 2K she started slowing from her 5:34 first mile and the chase pack caught her.&nbsp; She too fought for eighth place and also held on, running another personal best of 10:41.30.</p>
              <p>Next, McPhillips and Bacher were up in the 1500 final.&nbsp; The pace was quick from the start, so even though&nbsp;both McPhillips and Bacher were being cautious in the back of the 12 person final, they still came through the 400 in 72 and the 800 in 2:25--fast for temperatures in the mid-90's.&nbsp; In the third lap McPhillips moved up well and was in fourth position with a 4:38.&nbsp; Bacher let the group get away and was pretty far back at 3:41.&nbsp; In the final 300 McPhillips could not quite stay with the pack, falling back to a very respectable seventh in 4:33.58.&nbsp; Bacher made a strong push, just missing All American, ending up in ninth in 4:34.24.&nbsp; This was McPhillips first outdoor All America award and Bacher's first individual event final--major progress for both runners.              </p>
              <p>Hannah Chen was next up in the finals of the 400IH.&nbsp; In lane six, Chen got out okay, but seemed lethargic on the backstretch.&nbsp; Coming into the final turn she started to settle down and she ran a strong finish&nbsp;to gain seventh place out of the nine finalists&nbsp;in 61.25.&nbsp; This was Chen's eighth All American award; four in the 400IH and four as a member of the DMR at the indoor championship.</p>
              <p>In the Hammer Throw, Slutsky was seeded sixth with a best of 182-4.&nbsp; Right from the start she seemed cautious, not using the full circle on her turns and not turning at her normal velocity.&nbsp; Her best throw in the trials was 169-11 and that was her third throw.&nbsp; It took 174-6 to make finals and 175 to place.</p>
              <p>The final event for the Engineers was the men's Triple Jump.&nbsp; Billy Ruschel '18, seeded 11th, was the top jumper&nbsp;in the first flight.&nbsp; His first jump was at least a 48' jump, but he just fouled.&nbsp; He then jumped a weak 45-0 1/2.&nbsp; On his final attempt he was right about 49', but again barely fouled, ending his MIT career, but at least going for it and going out in style.&nbsp; Yorai&nbsp;Shaoul '21, the indoor runner-up and sixth seed at 49-5, did not mess around, starting off with a 50-10 3/4 jump, blowing away the MIT record and putting him in second place.&nbsp; His next jump was 51-8 1/2, putting him just 5 1/4&quot; out of first place.&nbsp; On his third attempt Shaoul jumped 51-5 1/2.&nbsp; Did he have a 52 jump in him?&nbsp; After the break before finals, Shaoul was not on step and ran through his fourth attempt.&nbsp; On his fifth attempt he seemed to have had it, but his back foot landed a bit farther back than his front, giving him a 51-3 effort.&nbsp; On his final attempt, he jumped 51-4 1/4, making five efforts over 50', each would have been a new MIT record.&nbsp; To&nbsp;say that Shaoul brings his best to the biggest stage is an understatement.</p>
              <p>The men finished with nine points and two All Americans, placing in a tie for 38th.&nbsp; The women earned five All America honors, scoring 13 1/2 points for 17th place.&nbsp; All in all a very successful meet for the Engineers.</p>
