    May 14-15, 2009
    
    
      
    
    MIT only brought a few individuals to the ECAC Division III Championship hosted by Springfield College, but those who made the trip continued to improve and step-up. Even though the women left some who could score in this meet at home, including Amy Magnuson '10, and did not double anyone in an attempt to score points, they still managed to finish in third place with 58 points. Likewise the men only brought four athletes, leaving Stephen Morton '10 and other scorers at home to prepare for finals or to rest for the NCAA Championships next week. 
    
    
      
    
    On Friday, the weather consisted of sixty five degree temperatures with rain and strong winds, not particularly conducive for great performances in track and field. Hazel Briner '11, was the first competitor for the Engineers, making another attempt at putting together a heptathlon score of 4400 points, the amount it would likely take to make the NCAA Championships. Her top score thus far had been 4049 and even with a perfect meet 4400 was probably out of reach. Meet management assisted by turning around the high hurdles to go with the wind. Briner took advantage and ran a strong 15.64 for 759 points and a good start. Her second event, the high jump provided her best heptathlon jump of the year with a 4-10 1/2 leap and another 610 points. In the shot put, Briner put together a personal best with a 37-10 effort, worth 630 more points. The final event of day one of the heptathlon, the 200 was run into the wind, which fortunately was only .8 meters per second at the time of the race. Briner ran her second best effort ever with a 27.71 for 654 points. Her first day total was certainly on the way to a great score. 
    
    
      
    
    The pole vault was moved inside due to the weather. The men were first and Nate Sharpe '09, was the first to enter for Tech. Sharpe cleared 13-10 and was over 14-4 but failed to do so without displacing the bar. Freshman Nathan Peterson continued to vault well, clearing 14-4 with good attempts at 14-10, but not enough to make the height. Greg Tao '10, cleared 15-9 3/4 with very good attempts at 16-3 1/2. Tao has made it into the NCAA field for the pole vault and will compete at 6:00 p.m. on Thursday evening. 
    
    
      
    
    Back on the track, Jennifer Doyle '09, was trying to improve on her 10,000 meter qualifying time of 36:50.43 as the NCAA has a finite number of competitors for the meet, and most event fields will have between 14-18 competitors. Doyle was ranked 21st on the 10K list. After weeks of working on her senior thesis, not getting the best of sleep and not being able to focus on track and field to the degree she would like, Doyle stepped on the line. Her pace was right on for the first seven laps but then she lost confidence in her ability and let her pace slip to 90 second quarters, which she maintained until the final mile when she realized she had something left. Gradually she picked up the pace, running the final two laps in 84 and 76 seconds respectively to move into second place in 37:07.75.
    
    
      
    
    In the women's pole vault, Emily Hwang '09, looked pretty good at 12-6, but was unable to clear the height, going out in second place with her vault of 12-3 1/2. Karin Fisher '11, did not have her best day in an attempt to better her NCAA qualifying mark of 11-8 1/2, clearing only 10-4. Hwang will vault at 4:00 p.m. on Friday at nationals. 
    
    
      
    
    On day two, the weather improved greatly, going to the extreme of 85 degrees, with little or no wind. Briner still had difficulty getting an outstanding long jump but did manage a pretty good 14-10 3/4 for 443 points. She popped a big javelin throw of 94-1, nearly a 10 foot PR, for 452 points. Briner saved her best for last as she ran an outstanding 2:29.11 in the 800 for 704 points and a 4247 total. Her score was an NCAA provisional mark but not enough to make the championship field. 
    
    
      
    
    In the 1500, Yermie Cohen '09, ran a strong race but just did not make his move soon enough. The first quarter was a pedestrian 65, but the pace picked up significantly to 61 with Cohen moving up to the front of the pack. The third quarter slowed a bit but the leaders still came through in 3:09. If Cohen would have moved then, he not only would have won but would likely have run 3:51. Instead he held back, not thinking he could kick from that far out, and waited until the final 100 to make his move. He ran a personal best of 3:53.84, .02 out of first place. Cohen's time will not likely get him into the NCAA field.
    
    
      
    
    Jacqui Wentz '10, had no issues of holding back. Running with the pack through the first quarter in 72 seconds, Wentz took the lead halfway through lap two, coming through the 800 in 2:25. Wentz lengthened her lead through the third quarter, splitting the 1200 in 3:38. Her final 300 was an incredible 52 seconds en route to a 4:30.94, a nine second personal best and an automatic NCAA qualifying time. Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, also ran the 1500 as a tune-up for the 10K at the NCAA's on Thursday night at 7:40 p.m. should she get into the field. Her 4:48.65 was five seconds off of her best as it did not seem she was as mentally prepared as in the past. Even though her 1500 time is the fifth fastest time in the country, Wentz is electing to race only in the 3000 Steeplechase on Friday at 5:35 p.m., an event in which she is seeded 12th, but has a very good chance of placing high. 
    
    
      
    
    Next on the track were freshman stars Portia Jones, and Martha Gross in the 400. Jones was trying to improve her NCAA qualifying time of 56.95 while Gross was attempting to dip into the 58s. Jones went out better than usual, running the first 200 in a high 26, but then seemed to back off for the third 100, not making up the big gap between her and Marcia McCord of Ithaca. In the final 100, Jones closed the gap but still lost by .66 seconds, running a personal best of 56.61. Gross seemed to be running for time instead of racing, running tense the entire way. Her 59.73 was not quite what she was hoping for. While Jones time will get her into nationals, she is deciding on racing the 400IH at the NCAA Championships where her 61.82 is the sixth fastest time in the championship field. Jones will run the 400IH trials at 5:20 on Thursday and if she makes the finals she will race on Saturday at 3:25. 
    
    
      
    
    Andrea Bradshaw '09, was in the 800, hoping to find the fight that made her the indoor New England Division III champion and the indoor 600 and 800 record holders for MIT. She did not take advantage of the slow 67 first 400, preferring to hang in the back of the pack. Her second quarter showed signs of the fight she used to have, but it was not enough to qualify for the NCAAs. She placed seventh in 2:16.75. 
    
    
      
    
    Jamie Simmons '12, the other sensational 400 freshman runner, was out to improve her 400IH time and hopefully make the NCAA field, which would take a sub 63 performance. Simmons ran the best race of the year as she did not stutter any hurdles, only making one step adjustments. Her off balance first steps after the hurdles cost her but she nevertheless ran a fine personal best of 63.57, good for fifth place. This time is not likely to make the 400IH field at nationals. 
    
    
      
    
    The final event of the championship for MIT was the 4x400 relay. The foursome of Simmons, Bradshaw, Gross and Jones owned the sixth fastest time in the country going into the day with a 3:52.03, but knowing there were many last chance meets as well as some very good competition in their own meet, that time may not hold up, and they needed to try to improve. Simmons led things off with a phenomenal 57.9 lead off leg to put MIT in second behind Cabrini College. Bradshaw lost a little time on the handoff as she left a little early and then got passed by a strong leg from Wheaton College even though she ran a solid 58.9 leg. However, she passed the Cabrini runner down the home stretch, moving MIT back into second. A good handoff to Gross helped, but her 59.5 leg lost a lot of ground to a very fast Cabrini third leg and a strong Wheaton runner. Jones received the baton 10 meters behind Wheaton and 20-25 behind Cabrini. Jones caught the Wheaton runner by the 200 mark but then similar to her open 400, seemed to save herself for the final 100. The fatiguing Cabrini runner took advantage of this and held on to a .55 second win over MIT's 3:52.85. MIT enters the championship as the eighth fastest team. They will run trials at 7:25 p.m. on Thursday, and the finals, should they qualify, at 4:55 p.m. on Saturday.

    **MIT Men and Women Earn Engineer's Meet Victory**
    
    
      
    
    April 4, 2009
    
    
      
    
    MIT began their true outdoor season (a meet involving most of the team) at WPI in Worcester, MA, the site of this year's annual Engineers Meet. The men claimed a relatively easy victory with a score of 160.5 to 123.5 for RPI and 113 for WPI. The women did not pull out the victory until the final event, the pole vault, to win with 146 points to 135 for RPI and 87 for WPI.
    
    
      
    
    The day started off pretty miserable with temperatures in the 40's and the wind gusting at 20-30 mph and proceeded to get worse with even harsher winds, making the wind chill too low to produce outstanding performances. If the facility were set up to utilize the strong winds it may have been beneficial for the sprints and jumps but with the ability to only use one finish line, which was running into the strong headwind, and the jumps perpendicular to the direction of the wind, making the pole vault miserable, pretty much everyone suffered through the meet.
    
    
      
    
    On the men's side it was simply a matter of too many MIT competitors at a relatively high level. However, Tech could have done much better. Stephen Morton '10, was sick and after winning the long jump, retired from the meet, meaning he would not be scoring in the triple jump, 100 or 200 and that MIT needed to substitute for his anchor leg in the 4x100 relay. In addition, MIT intentionally did not double up their top runners and moved some to different events. Nevertheless, MIT won with depth and by claiming seven of the 19 events. 
    
    
      
    
    Vlad Sobes '11, perhaps had the best mark for MIT with a javelin throw of 190-4 for the win. Greg Tao '10, took care of his specialty with a vault of 15-4 1/2. The only other field event victory for the men was earned by Mattias Flander in the triple jump with a mark of 43-1 1/2. In the running events, Richard Prevost '11, started things off with a well run 9:34.80 in the 3000 Steeplechase despite the strong winds. Right after that, MIT was all set to win the 4x100 as they were leading by three second going into the final handoff. After the handoff, the incoming runner ran into the adjacent lane and interfered with RPI's handoff, thus earning a DQ for MIT. In the 800, Yermie Cohen '09, dropped down in distance and displayed nice closing speed as he won in 1:58.52. Dan Harper '12, showed the ability to run alone in the wind as he took the lead with 2400 meters to go and ran 15: 52.55 for MIT's final victory of the day for the men despite the strongest winds of the day. 
    
    
      
    
    The women, lacking the depth and missing most of the distance squad due to a need for a break in racing, resting Margaret Leibovic '10, in the sprints due to leg soreness and giving Amy Magnuson '10, a very short day, needed high quality to secure the win. They provided this by winning 12 of the 19 events despite giving away victories in the 100HH and 100 due to the absence of Magnuson and Leibovic. 
    
    
      
    
    The women pulled ahead by six with Alina Gatowski's victory in the 5000 with an excellent PR of 18:45.58. They expanded it by two more with a strong victory in the 4x400 in 4:07.30 by Jamie Simmons '12, Jacqui Wentz '10, Adrienne Bolger '09, and Andrea Bradshaw '09. However, RPI scored 12 to 0 for MIT in the discus to take a three point lead with only the pole vault remaining. Fortunately, Karin Fisher '11, led the way in the horrible cross wind with a vault of 10-10 and was buoyed by second place from Emily Hwang '09, and third by Hazel Briner '11 to secure the win.
    
    
      
    
    The most spectacular performance on the women's side was by Jacqui Wentz, who literally threw caution to the wind in the 1500, running 4:40.10, a new PR and a new varsity record. Six other victories on the track were earned by Portia Jones '12, in both the 200 and 400, running 61.15 and 27.01 respectively; Andrea Bradshaw in the 800 with a wire to wire victory in 2:21.72; Jamie Simmons ran 66.43 in the 400IH for the win despite some difficulties finding her steps; Liz Labuz '09, ran a solid 12:19.7 for the victory in the 3000 Steeplechase and the quartet of Bradshaw, Simmons, Jones and Magnuson won the 4x100 on a come from behind leg by Magnuson to total 51.93.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT heads north to Colby College in Waterville, Maine to face Bates, host Colby and Southern Maine.

    **Five NCAA Qualifying Marks for MIT Highlight Maine Meet**
    
    
      
    
    April 11, 2009
    
    
      
    
    With many of the men's team members suffering from flu like symptoms, causing two key performers to miss the meet, and a couple missing the meet for personal reasons, MIT was facing a serious deficit going into its meet versus three teams from the state of Maine; Bates, Colby and Southern Maine (USM). Despite a furious flourish of points from MIT at the end, the lack of sprinters and jumpers did them in as they lost to a strong and balanced Bates squad for the first time in a regular season competition since 1983. The final score was Bates 227 and MIT 215. Southern Maine, ahead for much of the meet finished a close third at 210, while host Colby completed the scoring with 51. 
    
    
      
    
    The Tech women were not without any key performers, but due to those coming off of being sick and a couple nursing nagging leg issues, the team was certainly not at full strength. As a result, the lack of depth from MIT, combined with some great performances from Colby College, the meet came down to the final relays. MIT came out on top with 161 points to 154 for Colby and 105 for Bates. Southern Maine did not bring a women's team to the meet.
    
    
      
    
    As a highlight to the meet there were five NCAA qualifying performances by the Engineers. Four of them were earned by the women with Jacqui Wentz '10 and Emily Hwang '09, leading the way. Wentz ran an MIT record on the way to her 10:47.97, the second fastest time in the country for Division III at this time. Hwang jumped 12-3 1/2 to reset her own MIT record and vault to the highest mark in the country thus far. Portia Jones '12, looked much better in her second try at the 400IH, this time running 63.30 to provisionally qualify for nationals, set the MIT freshman record, and of course, win the race. Also in the pole vault, Karin Fisher '11, cleared 11-8 1/2 to provisionally qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship. On the men's side, Greg Tao '10, improved his provisional mark to 15-7 in the vault to win the event.
    
    
      
    
    With Stephen Morton '10, and Mattias Flander '11 missing the meet due to illness, MIT lost a lot of potential points in the long jump, triple jump, 100 and 200 meter races. In addition, Tony McDonald '10, was unable to compete in the throws and Richard Prevost '11, missed the bus, costing the Engineers some big points in the steeplechase. Others on the team stepped up and did their best to win the meet, but with eight scoring places per event in the men's meet, a couple of high places could easily be out weighed by multiple scorers from another team. 
    
    
      
    
    Early on, MIT would place relatively high but then get outscored due to the depth of Bates and USM. MIT outscored their opponents in only four individual events, the 800, 1500, 5000 and pole vault. MIT displayed an overall well balanced team, but the depth was just not there on this day. Behind by 30-40 points for most of the day, MIT came back strong in the pole vault at the end of the meet. Following Tao, MIT placed 4-5-6-7-8 for a total of 24 points. Following up that score, the 5K runners, led by Jake Ruzevick '09, who won in 15:09.73, placed 1-3-4-5 for another 24 points, finally passing Southern Maine, but not getting close enough to displace Bates College.
    
    
      
    
    MIT had five other winners on the day. Vlad Sobes '11, took the victory in the javelin with a throw of 180-2. Nick Leonard '11, was the only two event winner, taking both hurdle events. Leonard won the 110HH in a personal best of 16.06 and then came back with another personal best of 56.48 in the 400IH. Yermie Cohen '09, earned the other individual win with a 4:01.83 come from behind victory in the 1500. The men also took the 4x800 relay win to end the meet with Stephen Serene '12, providing the heroics with a 2:00 anchor leg to come from behind and provide MIT the victory.
    
    
      
    
    The women's meet was back and forth with Colby all day. Lacking depth in the throwing events and giving Jones and Magnuson '10, the day off from the jumping events for the most part, MIT lost to Colby in the field events, minus the pole vault, by a score of 69 to 31. Fortunately, Tech won 12 of 20 events and scored 20 of a possible 24 points in the pole vault to claim the close victory.
    
    
      
    
    In addition to Hwang's win in the pole vault, MIT claimed two other victories in the field events. Vicky Hsu '09, claimed one in the javelin with a great toss of 108-9. Hazel Briner '11, threw a personal best in the shot put to win in 37-4 1/2. MIT claimed most of the victories in the running events and probably would have won all but one with a totally healthy and confident Margaret Leibovic '10, to win the 100 and 200. The only other running event the women lost was the 1500, despite an outstanding personal best of 4:44.85 by Jennifer Doyle '09.
    
    
      
    
    In the 100HH, Amy Magnuson took the victory in 14.97 to narrowly beat teammate Portia Jones, who ran 15.09 to go along with her 400IH victory. Martha Gross '12, won the 400 in 61.73 despite going out much too fast for the first 200. Andrea Bradshaw '09, took care of business as usual in the 800 with a 2:19.13 victory. Anna Holt-Gosselin earned the victory in the 5K with a 17:56.81. MIT also took all three relay events, despite shuffling personnel around. Jones, Jamie Simmons '12, Bradshaw and Magnuson took the 4x100 in 50.54. Simmons, Kirsten Aarsvold '11, Adrienne Bolger '09, and Jones ran 4:06.01 for the win in the 4x400 and Wentz, Bradshaw, Erika Erickson '09, and Doyle completed the 4x800 in 9:31.47.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT has their final tune-up prior to the NEWMAC Conference Championship. The teams will travel to Springfield College, hoping for a warm weather invitational. Although many will rest for the upcoming championships, MIT does hope for some strong performances.

    **MIT Competes Well at NCAA Division III Championships**
    
    
      
    
    **Six Fourth Places, Four MIT Records for Engineers**
    
    
      
    
    May 21-23, 2009
    
    
      
    
    MIT was well represented at the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championships this week at Marietta College in Marietta, Ohio. Nine women (Andrea Bradshaw '09 4x400 relay, Jennifer Doyle '09 10K, Martha Gross '12 4x400 relay, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11 10K, Emily Hwang '09 pole vault, Portia Jones '12 400IH, 4x400 relay, Amy Magnuson '10 100HH, Jamie Simmons '12 400IH, 4x400 relay, Jacqui Wentz '10 3000 Steeplechase) and two men (Stephen Morton '10 Long Jump, Triple Jump, Greg Tao '10 Pole Vault) were ready to finish their season in style.
    
    
      
    
    First up in the three day meet was Morton in the long jump. No one seemed to be jumping great in the trials, so Morton's 22-6 1/2 stood up to get him into the nine man final in seventh place. Individuals began to jump better in the final, including Morton, who landed a couple of 24' bombs that were unfortunately very narrow fouls. The two individuals behind him jumped further while Morton fouled all of him attempts to finish in ninth.
    
    
      
    
    Tao was up next in the pole vault. Seeded 11th, Tao hoped to be among the final few vaulters as he did indoors earlier this year. Jumping clean (no misses) through heights of 15-3 1/2, 15-7 1/4 and a new outdoor personal best of 15-11 1/4, Tao was guaranteed an All America slot as many vaulters went out at the 15-11 1/4 height. Making three excellent attempts at 16-3, Tao was unable to clear the height. Being clean through the earlier heights earned Tao fourth place in the event.
    
    
      
    
    On the track, Jones and Simmons were up in the 400IH trials. Jone's heat was up first. She did not get out real well and had to reach a bit for the first hurdle, but then she settled down and cruised over the next five hurdles, making up ground and catching up to the leaders. The next four hurdles Jones stuttered up to and did not pull her trail leg through, yet she ran pretty well between the hurdles. Her overall strength netted her a personal best of 61.73 even with the disastrous four hurdles. Her time ended up as the fifth fastest in the trials. Simmons ran a very good race, looking great over all of the hurdles. Her 63.68 placed her 16th overall and was not fast enough to make the final. Simmons came in as the 19th seed so her improvement is something the freshman can build on. 
    
    
      
    
    Two hours later, Simmons and Jones joined Bradshaw and Gross to run the 4x400 trials. Coming into the meet as the eighth seed, there was hope the foursome could make the finals. Simmons got things rolling out in lane seven with an incredible personal best leadoff of 56.8. This put MIT right at the front of the pack at the handoff. Bradshaw got out well and ran the first part of the race fast in order to stay with the leaders, but was third at the break. Coming around the final turn she fell back to fourth but stayed pretty close with a fine 58.4 leg. At the handoff to Gross, the incoming runner from the team just in front of MIT moved into Gross's path causing a collision and slowing her down significantly. Nevertheless, Gross ran an outstanding leg, maintaining fourth place and putting MIT about 10 meters behind second and third place. However, again the handoff went wrong when Jones also ran into the incoming runner, putting her 15 or so meters behind at the start. Frustrated with the collision, Jones did not challenge the leaders and fell back to fifth place on the backstretch and never regained the place with her 57.2 leg. MIT's 3:51.68 was a personal best and new MIT record but was only 12th out of the 15 teams. Given the format for advancement, top two teams in each heat and the next two fastest times, MIT would have had to run 3:49.88 to make it into the finals. Even without the two collisions Jones would have had to have run about 56 flat to have gotten MIT into Saturday's race.
    
    
      
    
    On Friday, Magnuson was the first to compete for MIT, running in the second heat of the 100HH trials. With a fine start, but hitting a few hurdles, Magnuson finished in second in 14.50 running into the 1.5 meter per second headwind. Her time was the sixth fastest in the trials, earning her a spot in the finals on Saturday.
    
    
      
    
    In the steeplechase, Wentz went out with the leaders, running a nice paced first mile of 5:36. She continued that pace, staying with, but in the back of the lead pack of six runners through the first six laps. When the leader finally made a break in the final lap and a half, Wentz was unable to go with her. In the final straight Wentz moved up to fourth with a great kick to earn her first All America honor. Her 10:32.61 was a 15 second personal best and another MIT record.
    
    
      
    
    Emily Hwang was last to compete for MIT on Friday, jumping in the pole vault competition. Hwang looked excellent, clearing each of her heights (11-4 1/2, 11-10 1/2, 12-2 1/2, 12-6 1/4) on the first attempt. Similar to Tao, Hwang had very strong attempts at 12-10 1/4, but was just not quite able to clear the height. Hwang finishes her career with an outstanding fourth place finish to again earn All America honors. 
    
    
      
    
    On Saturday, Morton was back in competition in the triple jump. This time he did not let fouls get in the way. All six jumps were between 47-00 3/4 and 49-07 3/4, the latter good for fourth place and a new MIT record. Morton's first jump was 48-08 1/4, which put him in fifth place going into the finals. His fifth jump was his 49-07 3/4 leap that moved him up to third. However, in the final round he was passed by four centimeters. The top four jumpers were separated by only 19 centimeters. 
    
    
      
    
    Amy Magnuson was back in the finals of the 100HH, completing a season long comeback from a serious hamstring tear the year before. She made the most of the opportunity, improving from her trials run, running 14.37 into a slight headwind for a fourth place finish.
    
    
      
    
    MIT's final event was the 400IH featuring MIT's star freshman, Portia Jones. Similar to the trials, Jones did not get out really well, stuttering on the first hurdle. She then began to move, almost pulling even with the field at the fifth and moving into a solid third place on the sixth hurdle, she caught her lead leg and nearly fell, losing ground and falling to fifth place. Her poor trail leg continued to plague her although she moved back to fourth, she was unable to get third, being out-leaned by .01 seconds. Jones finished in 61.76.
    
    
      
    
    Overall, the women finished in a tie for 10th place with 20 points, their highest finish ever. The men tied for 29th place with 10 points. The six total individual All America honors was an excellent representation of what MIT has accomplished this year in track and field.

    Six MIT records, five new or improved NCAA qualifying marks and thirty four personal bests led MIT to perhaps their best meet ever. At the New England Division III Championships, hosted by Springfield College, MIT men and women coming off an average performance in winning the NEWMAC Conference Championship last weekend, knew they would have to step-up big if they were to give heavily favored Williams College a run. In the women's meet, Williams was seeded to score 161.5 points to 113 for MIT, while on the men's side, Williams was favored by a score of 112 to 95. Of the twenty plus other teams, none were seeded to be within 30 points of MIT in either meet. The women had a career  and history defining weekend, pulling off the upset while scoring 152.5 points to 143 for Williams. The MIT men also had a phenomenal meet, outscoring their seeds to finish second to Williams 136.66 points with 108 of their own. 
    
    
      
    
    If Portia Jones '12, carried the team point wise with 25 points by winning the 200, 400 and placing fourth in the100HH despite her blocks slipping, as well as leading off the fourth place 4x100 and anchoring the winning 4x400 team, then Jacqui Wentz '10, embodied the spirit and determination of this team and Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, Jennifer Doyle '09, and Jamie Simmons '12, the fight and unwillingness to lose. Wentz set two new MIT records and was the anchor leg in the 4x800 relay that was not only victorious but crushed the MIT record, running 9:13.96 after Wentz pulled off a come from behind 2:14.0 anchor to set up the 4x400 to hold onto the 7.5 point lead. In her first race, the 3000 Steeplechase, Wentz ran 10:47.46 to improve her own NCAA qualifying mark and MIT record. Later, she was back on the track in the 800 where she finished third in 2:15.76 to claim the MIT record from Andrea Bradshaw '09, who finished fifth in the race with 2:16.56.
    
    
      
    
    Holt-Gosselin, ran the 10K on Friday, gamely trying to go with the leader, but after coming through the 3200 in 11:26 she began to fall off the ambitious pace. The early consistent 85 second quarters eventually caught up to her, causing her to slip to third at the end despite her 37:31.12. On Saturday, with the promise of not using her in the 5,000 meter race she was entered in unless the meet was on the line, Holt-Gosselin was pretty sure she was finished competing in the meet. However, with the incredible performances piling up, MIT took the lead in the meet two events before the 5K. With Williams seeded to place 1-3-4-5 and Holt-Gosselin second, it was critical to have her in there if MIT was going to have a chance to pull out the meet. Somehow she found the strength to run 17:51.69 to garner third place. 
    
    
      
    
    Jennifer Doyle, feeling the pressure and stress of finishing her thesis, was not feeling the best going into the meet. This has never stopped Doyle from performing big when it is needed. In the 1500, she moved strong at the 800 mark, coming through the 1200 in 3:46 and finishing in a big PR of 4:40.20, good for fifth place. Coming back in the 5,000, Doyle was not seeded to score. Once again, Doyle came through despite initially appearing to give up. At the 3200 mark, in 13th place, 19 seconds behind Holt-Gosselin, Doyle began to move. Running quarters of 89, 87, 83, 77 and finishing with a 36 final 200, Doyle moved all the way to fourth to run 17:57.85.
    
    
      
    
    Jamie Simmons, continues to improve by leaps and bounds each week. Running both relays as well as the 400 and 400IH, Simmons had a full plate. Running a fine second leg in the 4x100 relay, she helped set the team up for their fourth place finish. In the 400, seeded fifth at 59.12, Simmons finished with a vicious final 200 to place third in 58.13. An hour later, in the 400IH where she was seeded sixth, she looked beat and fatigued over the first six hurdles. It then appeared as if Simmons looked up, saw she was in last place, and just decided she was not going to accept that outcome. She bolted past the runners, finishing in third with a another personal best of 64.91. 
    
    
      
    
    The women began their meet on Friday with the first day of the heptathlon, as well as the 10K, long jump and hammer throw. Neither MIT nor Williams was very strong in the field events with the exception of the pole vault for MIT, but Amy Magnuson pulled off a big surprise in the long jump, moving up from her eighth place seed to finish fourth with a jump of 17-8 3/4, just fouling her last attempt that would have moved her to second place.
    
    
      
    
    In the 10K, in addition to Holt-Gosselin, MIT entered Tania Morimoto '12 and Alina Gatowski '11. Morimoto, feeling drained the past few weeks, had taken some time in the pool rather than on the roads to try and recover. It must have worked, as combined with her will to succeed, she was able to hold onto fifth place despite fading from a very ambitious early pace. Morimoto's final time was 38:32.88. Gatowski, running a huge personal best, just missed scoring as she finished ninth in 39:40.35.
    
    
      
    
    On Saturday, MIT began things with the second day of the heptathlon, the pole vault and the 3000SC. After building up a nice lead on day one led by her personal best of 15.88 in the 100HH, Hazel Briner '10, held her ground with marks of 14-11 1/4 in the long jump, 76-1 in the javelin and 2:33.33 in the 800 to win the event overall with 3972 points. In addition to Wentz's 3000SC victory, Liz Labuz '09, and Maggie Lloyd '12, ran personal bests of 11:44.22 and 11:54.39 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    The pole vault, MIT's big event, was not a disappointment. Seeded to score 18 points, it would have been easy to lose some of those key points, but the vaulters came through big with Emily Hwang '09, leading the way with a 12-7 1/2 winning vault and New England Division III meet record. Karin Fisher '11, jumped 11-7 3/4 to garner third, and in the middle of her heptathlon, Briner managed to clear 10-2 to place sixth, one place higher than she was seeded to finish, giving the Engineers 19 points in the event.
    
    
      
    
    After the fourth place finish of the 4x100 (Jones, Simmons, Margaret Leibovic '10, Magnuson) and Doyle's fifth place finish in the 1500, Magnuson and Jones were on the track for the final of the 100HH. In the trials, both had won their heats with Jones running a personal best of 15.01 and Magnuson running 14.48. In the finals, Jones had blocks missing some spikes on the bottom and did not get someone to hold her blocks, resulting in her blocks slipping at the start, causing her to nearly fall. Despite this start, Jones ran as the superb competitor she is and nearly caught the third place runner, finishing in 15.18 for fourth. Magnuson had no such problems, sprinting to a season best 14.39 victory.
    
    
      
    
    Jones, running in the very next event, the 400, received the time benefit of running her hurdle race before the men's 110HH final and her 400 after the men's 400 final, giving her nearly 30 minutes to recover. This proved to be plenty as she took her frustration from the hurdles out on the 400 field, running away with a 57.24 victory. In addition to Simmons' third place, another freshman, Martha Gross, placed eighth with a season best of 59.39 despite not being seeded to score.
    
    
      
    
    After the 800, in the 400IH, in addition to Simmons' third place finish, Kirsten Aarsvold '11, ran a great race, finishing in 66.65 for a huge personal best and a tie for eighth place, giving MIT 1/2 point.
    
    
      
    
    Jones was back on the track in the 200. Despite having to run the full turn due to her assignment in lane one, and her notoriously poor start, Jones recovered from spotting the field 15 meters and closed with an incredible final 100 to pull out the victory in 25.69.
    
    
      
    
    After the very successful 5000 where MIT scored 11 points to the eight they were seeded and Williams scored 18 as compared to the 25 they were seeded for, the relays were all that was left. Entering the 4x800 relay, MIT held a 5.5 point lead. MIT was seeded to place fourth and Williams seventh, but it was obvious that both teams had the runners to place 1-2. What was to be determined was which would take first and which one second. Bradshaw led off for MIT, hoping to give the Engineers a nice lead after the first leg. Williams had the same idea and were a bit more successful with their plan, opening up a ten meter lead after Bradshaw's 2:19.2 leg. Adrienne Bolger '09, was next and did not disappoint, closing the lead with an excellent 2:20.1 leg. Freshman, Alicia Kaestli, took the baton for the third leg, running a very well paced 2:20.5 to keep MIT with 10 meters of both Williams and Middlebury. This set up the heroics of Wentz, who gradually closed the lead down with her opening 400 of 66 and then completed the job, pulling away in the final 200 to win by over two seconds.
    
    
      
    
    All MIT needed to do in the 4x400 was to finish no worse than sixth if Williams were to win the event. Out in lane eight, with a three turn stagger, Simmons led off with a big 58.6 to put MIT in the lead. Gross came back with a 60.2 to maintain the lead and Aarsvold ran an excellent 61.1 to give Jones a small lead, but that was all she would need as she put the icing on the cake with a 57.6 anchor to finish in 3:57.76 
    
    
      
    
    For the men, Friday was exceptional both in points scored and in quality of performance. The decathlon second day was finishing and Travis Hery '11, was in seventh place with 5343 points, more than 200 points higher than his seed. Right after that, both the long jump and 10K were starting. In the 10K, Jake Ruzevick '09, Dan Harper '12, and Jack Bourbonnais '10, hung onto the leaders through a very pedestrian pace, which saw the participants come through the 4800 in 16:00. The pace picked up to a 5:10 fourth mile and then a 5:07, which is where the leaders broke away. Ruzevick hung on to finish fourth in 32:42.00 while Harper and Bourbonnais were relatively close behind in fifth and sixth, running 32:47.98 and 33:17.21 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    Over in the long jump pit, Stephen Morton '10, was almost completely healed from his back injury and appeared ready to compete. However his first jump was a foul and his second jump was only a little over 22'. Knowing he needed a big jump to guarantee finals, Morton hit the jump perfectly, landing at 24-02 1/4, a quarter inch further than the record held by Stanley Johnson in 1934. Trying to save his legs and back, MIT shut Morton down as they were certain the huge jump was enough to win without him jumping in the finals. The 24 points were more than MIT had hoped for and positioned them well after day one.
    
    
      
    
    At the start of day two, MIT opened big with Richard Prevost '11, and Paul Welle '11, in the 3000 Steeplechase. The top seed from Keene State, Cory Loonan, took the pace out very fast in 68 seconds for the first quarter. Prevost and Welle were the only ones who followed and when Loonan fell off the fast pace they were left by themselves. They went on to place 1-2 in 9:26.54 and 9:28.79 respectively, both PRs, for 18 big points.
    
    
      
    
    MIT failed to score in the 4x100, but over in the discus circle, Mitch Kelley '11, went from eighth place to second on his final throw, tossing the discus 149-00 for another big MIT personal best. Similarly, Tony McDonald '10, was sitting in eighth in the shot put and moved to fourth on his final throw with a put of 45-10 1/2. MIT was only seeded to score six in the discus and two in the shot, so the combined 13 points were a big help.
    
    
      
    
    Back on the track, Yermie Cohen '09, was in a very fast 1500. The opening 400 was in 60 and the half in 2:01. Cohen was back at 2:03 towards the front of the spread out pack. The third quarter was slower for Cohen, who came through in 3:07. He ran the final 300 in 50 seconds to hold onto fifth place in 3:57.09, two places higher than he was seeded.
    
    
      
    
    The next event MIT was entered in on the track was the 400IH. Nick Leonard '11, ran a great finish even though his backstretch was uncharacteristically poor, finishing in a personal best of 55.55, good for sixth place.
    
    
      
    
    Vlad Sobes '11, placed fifth in the javelin with a throw of 178-4 and may have broken his foot on his first throw. MIT will have to wait until Monday to see what damage was done to his foot. 
    
    
      
    
    Over in the triple jump, Morton and Mattias Flander '11, were taking care of business. Seeded fourth and seventh, both jumpers brought it this day. Morton jumped 48-4 3/4 for second place and his second MIT record of the meet. Flander jumped a personal best 46-5 1/4 for fourth place.
    
    
      
    
    Before Morton made his record making jump, he had to line up for the 200, a race in which he was seeded eighth. Not able to do much working out on the track with his back as of late, Morton seemed lacking in the necessary strength but he nevertheless managed a fourth place in 22.42.
    
    
      
    
    The final field event for MIT was the pole vault. With seven vaulters in the field, MIT stood a strong chance of scoring well. Seeded to score 16, Greg Tao '10, Nathan Peterson '12, and Nate Sharpe '09, combined for second, third and tied for fifth respectively for a total of 19 points. 
    
    
      
    
    Not knowing how the pole vault would turn out, MIT made the decision to keep Ruzevick and Cohen entered in the 5K to go along with a fresh Hemagiri Arumugam '10. The pace was quick and Arumugam was up to the task, coming through the 1600 in 4:52, the 3200 in 9:44 and the 4800 in 14:32 before finishing in fourth place in 15:04.11. Ruzevick made a remarkable comeback to place seventh in 15:14.54, an exceptional time after running the 10K the evening before. Cohen got cramps in his calves and did not place despite his 15:33.36.
    
    
      
    
    MIT will now focus on individuals trying to make or improve marks to get to nationals. The next meet will be the NEICAAA Championship on Friday and Saturday at UMass Amherst. The championship brings the best of all track and field athletes from New England colleges, regardless which division they are in.

    **Engineers Set Five More NCAA Qualifying Marks at All New England Championship**
    
    
      
    
    May 8-9, 2009
    
    
      
    
    After last weekend's record setting performances in the New England Division III Championship, MIT chose to rest many of its athletes, either giving them the weekend off from competing or limiting the number of events performed. The primary focus for MIT track and field now is preparing athletes for the NCAA Division III Championship, May 21-23. So, entering this weekend for the New England Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association Championship (NEICAAA) at the University of Massachusetts, there was no effort or expectation from a team perspective, but there was a high expectation on individual performances. MIT came through in a big way with five new or improved NCAA qualifying performances, two new MIT records, one freshman record and nine personal or season bests. 
    
    
      
    
    Even without distance stars, Jacqui Wentz '10, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, and Jennifer Doyle '09, MIT's women still scored 37 points to finish in a tie for ninth place among all of the colleges in New England, finishing as the number one Division III team. Emily Hwang '09, once again failed to clear 13' by the narrowest of margins, settling for a rare second place at 12-3 1/2 in the pole vault. Teammate Karin Fisher '11, placed 6th with a vault of 11-5 3/4.
    
    
      
    
    Hazel Briner '11, reset her own MIT record in the heptathlon with a score of 4049 points, setting an impressive personal best in the 100HH of 15.49. Briner placed 8th overall after a disappointing long jump caused her to lose a lot of ground after being in third after day one.
    
    
      
    
    In the high hurdles, Amy Magnuson '10, won the 100HH in a season best 14.34, reaching the auto standard for NCAA qualifying. In the finals Magnuson hit two hurdles as she was being more aggressive in getting her lead leg on the ground. One of the hurdles, the sixth one, threw her off balance, costing her valuable time, letting her know she can definitely run faster. 
    
    
      
    
    Portia Jones '12, Jamie Simmons '12, and Kirsten Aarsvold '11, all ran the 400IH and all ran personable bests in the trials. Jones won her section in 62.45 while Simmons was the final qualifier for Saturday's finals in 64.22. Aarsvold did not advance but finished the season on a high note, running 66.55. In the finals, both Jones and Simmons got out well, but Simmons continued to have difficulty finding the rhythm of the event. She finished in eighth in 64.81. Jones ran very well, finishing in second in 61.82, bettering the NCAA auto standard and setting a new MIT standard in the event.
    
    
      
    
    In the women's final event, Simmons, Andrea Bradshaw '09, Martha Gross '12, and Jones were trying for an improvement on their time of 3:56.16 in the 4x400. Needing a 3:53 or better to feel secure in qualifying for nationals, the team was determined to run their best. Simmons led off with her signature strong leg of 58.5 to put MIT towards the front of the pack. Bradshaw ran her best leg ever, turning a 58.2, handing off to Gross in 5th place, but within one second of the leader. Gross got a nice break at the handoff, but fell far behind in the first 200. However, she moved up well with a great second 200 to finish in 58.6, although MIT handed off in sixth place. Jones moved quickly behind the second through fifth runners and realized she needed to go around. Once she went around this group she started moving on second place, but ran out of track, finishing in third place, .08 behind UMass Amherst, in 3:52.03, setting a new MIT mark with that time and now own the sixth fastest time in NCAA Division III. 
    
    
      
    
    For the men, Paul Welle '11, stole the spotlight. Seeded with a best time ever in the 3000 Steeplechase of 9:28.79, Welle stepped up and raced for the victory despite losing his right shoe, the foot he usually uses to push off the water jump barrier. Coming through the mile in a very quick 4:58, Welle stayed up front, lasting until the final lap when the two leaders finally pulled away. Welle finished in third in 9:18.09, a solid NCAA provisional qualifying mark and ranked fifth on the all-time MIT list. 
    
    
      
    
    Stephen Morton '10, earned two sixth places in the long jump and triple jump but did not jump well in either. Morton's marks were 22-7 and 45-4 1/4, far from his best he delivered the week before.
    
    
      
    
    Greg Tao '10, and Nathan Peterson '12, placed in the pole vault with jumps of 15-3 and 14-9 respectively, but neither vaulted their best. Tao placed sixth and Peterson eighth.
    
    
      
    
    Two other men's performances deserve mention despite not earning any points. In the 1500, Yermie Cohen '09, ran a nice race, setting a personal outdoor best of 3:54.48, an NCAA provisional qualifying time. Running in the back, Cohen was in a section that came through the 400 in 60 seconds. Slowing at the half to 2:06, the pace again picked up in the third 400 with Cohen coming through in 3:07. He moved up well in the last 300 meters but ran out of track, finishing in 10th place.
    
    
      
    
    Matt Bieniosek '09, closed out his MIT career with a personal best in the outdoor 800, running 1:55.18 in an excellent race.
    
    
      
    
    MIT will be taking a few athletes to the ECAC Division III Championships next Thursday and Friday at Springfield College to see if a they can improve on their NCAA qualifying marks or just to fine tune going into the NCAA Championship the following week.

    **MIT Takes Care of Business, Winning NEWMAC Titles for Men and Women**
    
    
      
    
    April 25, 2009
    
    
      
    
    Both Men's and Women's teams from MIT were seeded to win the NEWMAC Outdoor Track and Field Championship on Saturday at Mt. Holyoke College and win they did. Despite the unseasonably mid 80 degree temperatures, and the oven like atmosphere on the track that had an artificial turf field, the Engineers used depth on the men's side, and quality on the women's side to win their respective championships, the ninth in succession for the men and 10th over the 11 years the conference has been in existence and the second overall for the women. The final scores for the men were MIT 230, WPI 179, Springfield 151, Coast Guard 137, Wheaton 56 and Babson 14. For the women, MIT was first with 248 points, Springfield was second with 175, Wheaton 155, Smith 81, WPI 60, Babson 27, Mt. Holyoke 15 and Coast Guard with 9.
    
    
      
    
    MIT had relatively few winners on the men's side. Stephen Morton '10, usually the star of this meet with two NEWMAC Athlete of the Year awards to show for it, was suffering from back pain and was not able to produce his usual top performances, although he did manage second place efforts in both the long jump and triple jump with leaps of 23-0 1/2 and 46-2 respectively. Wins were produced in the pole vault by Greg Tao '10, (15-10 1/2) and then all the events from the 1500 and up with Yermie Cohen '09 taking the 1500 (3:58.31), Richard Prevost '11, the 3000 Steeplechase (9:35.51), Dan Harper '12, the 5000 (15:51.86) and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, the 10K (33:11.64).
    
    
      
    
    Most of Tech's points were scored using their depth in the distance events, the pole vault, high hurdles and pole vault. Overall, the field events were the weakest area for MIT, scoring only 77 points, 25 of which came via the pole vault. WPI scored 101 points in the field, owing mostly to their 1-2-3-4 sweep in the hammer throw, but also showed pretty good balance. 
    
    
      
    
    The goal for MIT, for both men and women, was to win with as slow of times as possible, saving themselves for the remaining championships and keeping in mind the high temperatures. This certainly held the times down in the longer races, particularly the 5K and 10, although this served MIT well as they scored a combined 89 points in the 1500, 3000SC, 5000 and 10K.
    
    
      
    
    MIT's focus was on Coast Guard, the team that had emerged as the strongest opponent last year and appeared on paper to be the biggest threat this year. WPI, typically in the lower half of the final ranking of teams, surprised many with their early lead that lasted halfway through the meet. MIT Coach Halston Taylor never even considered the strength of WPI, which in retrospect was seeded to score 168.5 points, making them the second seeded team going into the meet. MIT was seeded to score 249, but the absence of Morton and not scoring at the expected level in the 800, high jump, discus and hammer hurt the Engineers chances of beating their seed total. 
    
    
      
    
    In addition to those champions mentioned above, others receiving All Conference honors for MIT for placing among the top two were: Vlad Sobes '11, in the javelin, Morton in both the long jump and triple jump, Tony McDonald '10, Jake Ruzevick '09, in the 1500 and 5000, Paul Welle '11, in the 3000SC and Jack Bourbonnais '10, in the 10K. 
    
    
      
    
    The women entered the conference championship, whose rules only allow four entries per team per event, with only 24 team members. Their was some concern that the lack of depth might hurt the engineers, but the quality of performances more than made up for it. Showing a lack of strength in the field events certainly affected MIT's chances as Springfield College racked up the points, outscoring MIT 99 to 56, despite MIT taking 24 in the pole vault led by a new MIT record and a win by Emily Hwang '09, of 12-6 1/4. The track is where MIT prospered, winning every individual event from the 400 through the 10K as well as the 100HH and 4x100 relay, outscoring Springfield 192 to 76. The only running events the Engineers did not win were the 100, 200 and 4x400 relay.
    
    
      
    
    In addition to Hwang, victors were Amy Magnuson '10, in the 100HH (14.48 into the wind), Portia Jones '12, in the 400 (57.69), Jamie Simmons '12, in the 400IH (66.04), Andrea Bradshaw '09, in the 800 (2:17.03), Katherine Eve '12, in the 1500 (4:45.03), Jacqui Wentz '10, in the 3000SC (11:05.56), Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, in the 5000 (18:50.01), Tania Morimoto '12, in the 10K (39:13.45), and Jones, Simmons, Margaret Leibovic '10, and Magnuson in the 4x100 (49.47).
    
    
      
    
    Again, the times were somewhat slow as the strategy was to keep the pace slow if possible. In the 1500, Katherine Eve ran a 2:26 final 800 as the first 700 was very slow. Holt-Gosselin finished with a 37 second final 200 in the very slow 5000. Both of these kicks were necessary to secure the victories whereas in the 10K it was not a factor.
    
    
      
    
    Other All Conference honorees were: Jones in the 200, Wentz in the 800, Jennifer Doyle '09, in the 1500, Liz Labuz '09, in the 3000SC and the 4x400 relay team of Martha Gross '12, Wentz, Kirsten Aarsvold '11, and Bradshaw. Not running Jones and Simmons in the 4x400 was just a matter of pulling back a little at the end of the meet since these women were already pretty fatigued. 
    
    
      
    
    The top point scorers for MIT in the meet were Magnuson and Jones for women, both scoring 23.5 points, while the injured Morton produced 18.5 points for the men.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT enters the New England Division III Championship, hosted by Springfield College. The decathlon is held Thursday and Friday, while the remainder of the meet is contested on Friday and Saturday.

    Men and Women Place Second in San Diego 
    
    
                  
    
    **Three Varsity Records Highlight Meet for Women**
    
    
                  
    
     March 28, 2009 
    
    
                  
    
    MIT Men's and Women's Track and Field teams both placed second at the Point Loma Nazarene University Spring Invitational. The men finished second with 285.5 in the twelve team meet behind Azusa Pacific with 313.5, although a scoring errors in the shot put and triple jump provided Azusa Pacific with a larger margin than it actually had. The women scored 267.5 to Point Loma's 303. Both teams representing the Engineers were only represented by approximately half the team as the cost of the week long spring trip to California precludes bringing more individuals.
    
    
                  
    
    The scoring awarded points to the top 14 places in each event, but no more than two individuals could score per team per event. The awarded points for first place was 15 points and then 13 for second decreasing by one point increments to one point for 14th place.
    
    
                  
    
    For the women, Jacqui Wentz '10, was the only double winner, taking the 3000 Steeplechase in a personal best of 11:00.30, which provisionally qualified her for the NCAA Division III Championship. A couple  hours later she came back in the 800 with a 2:18.69. 
    
    
                  
    
    Emily Hwang '09, winner in the pole vault had the other NCAA provisional qualifying mark with a 12-0 3/4 vault. She narrowly missed making 12-6. Her mark also set the MIT varsity record. 
    
    
                  
    
    Two more varsity records and one freshman record were also recorded by the women's team. The 4x100 team sprinted their way to a 49.47 record despite two pretty poor handoffs. The quartet of Margaret Leibovic '10, Jamie Simmons '12, Portia Jones '12, and Amy Magnuson '10 have the potential to get into the 48s this year. Andrea Bradshaw '09, Martha Gross '12, Simmons and Jones smashed the existing MIT record by six seconds, running a 3:58.35. This record should also drop some more by season's end. Simmons had quite the impact on the track team in her first meet as she also set the freshman record in the 400IH with a 65.62, barely nipping Jones in her 400IH debut of 65.64.
    
    
                  
    
    Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, after running a nice personal record in the 1500 in 4:43.58 to place second,  came back to win the 5000 in 17:59.21, running just fast enough to win.
    
    
                  
    
    In the men's meet, Mattias Flander '11, was one of three victors for MIT, claiming the triple jump with a 44-11 effort. The results mixed up the first and third place, placing Flander in third incorrectly.
    
    
                  
    
    Paul Welle '11, earned the 3000 Steeplechase victory for the second consecutive year. Welle's time of 9:40.68 just outkicked a competitor from the host school as well as his teammate, Richard Prevost '11.
    
    
                  
    
    Mitch Kelley '11, won the discus with a throw of 145-6, a big personal best for the sophomore. He threw an even better mark that he narrowly fouled in stepping out of the circle.
    
    
                  
    
    Although he did not win, Greg Tao '10, provisionally qualified in the pole vault with a jump of 15-5 to claim second in the event.
    
    
                  
    
    Many other personal best and New England Division III qualifying marks were had on the warm but windy day. MIT represented itself well in its first meet of the season. Next week, MIT is back in Massachusetts as they head mid-state to WPI to defend their Engineer's Cup title against RPI and WPI.

    Minus Distance Runners, MIT Wins Springfield Invitational
    
    
      
    
    Women Set Four NCAA Qualifying Marks, Men One 
    
    
      
    
    April 18, 2009
    
    
      
    
    MIT traveled to Springfield College on Saturday for the Springfield Invitational. While not quite spring weather. the conditions were the best MIT has seen since the Point Loma meet in California. The temperatures started out around 65 degrees with the sun shining but when the clouds came out the temperatures dropped to 60 with a strong wind. This did not seem to affect anyone as MIT had five NCAA qualifying marks, four for the women and one for the men. 
    
    
      
    
    Traveling sans distance runners, with just the goal of setting individuals up for the championships, MIT nevertheless won both the men's and women's meet. The men defeated 12 other teams by scoring 199.5 points, while the women defeated 11 other teams with 178.5 points. 
    
    
      
    
    The NCAA qualifiers were led by Amy Magnuson '10, who found her rhythm in the 100HH, running a 14.47 despite a poor start, winning by over a second. Also qualifying for nationals was Portia Jones '12, who did not win the 400, but she did finish second with a 56.95. Emily Hwang '09, won the pole vault, nearly clearing 12-7, although she did clear 12-1 1/2, two inches lower than her best this season, which leads all NCAA Division III qualifiers. The womens 4x400 team of Jamie Simmons '12, Andrea Bradshaw '09, Martha Gross '12, and Jones ran yet another school record in 3:56.16 to easily win the event. Simmons smoked the opening leg with a 58.1 to set up the victory. Bradshaw and Gross both delivered 59.4 legs, setting Jones up for a 58.5 anchor. Although the quartet has the second fastest time in the country to this point, they will need to run about two seconds faster if they hope to make the NCAA Championship field. Stephen Morton '10, was the only male setting an NCAA mark for MIT. After finally recovering from a severe cold that put him out for two weeks, Morton leaped to a 23-6 1/4 winning long jump.
    
    
      
    
    Many victories were earned by the Engineers. On the women's side, Simmons won the 400IH with a 66.13. Jacqui Wentz '10, won the 1500 in an MIT record of 4:39.64. Also, Liz Labuz '09, took first place honors in the 3000 Steeplechase with a personal best of 11:47.85. For the men, Vlad Sobes '11, won his specialty, the javelin throw, with a toss of 176-8. Greg Tao '10, won the pole vault despite the low height of 14-2 3/4. Morton also won the triple jump, but with only being permitted two jumps by the coaches, was only able to jump 46-3 1/2. Yermie Cohen '09, took the 1500 in a time of 4:01.00. Paul Welle '11, earned the victory in the 3000 Steeplechase with a 9:34.73. Jake Ruzevick '09, took the 10K with a casual run in 32:52.51.
    
    
      
    
    Both of Portia Jones' efforts set MIT records. Jones' 200 time was a 25.32, setting both the freshman and varsity record. Her 400 time also set both the freshman and varsity record. 
    
    
      
    
    Next weekend, MIT travels to Mount Holyoke for the NEWMAC Championship. Wheaton College has won the women's meet every year but one, when MIT took the championship in 2007. The MIT men have won the championship every year with the exception of 2000 when Springfield College earned the victory. MIT has a good chance at winning both championships if the teams perform the way they are capable and compete at the championship level MIT is known for.
