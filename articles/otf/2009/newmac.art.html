  <p align="left">April 25, 2009</p>
  <p align="left">Both Men's and Women's teams from MIT were seeded to win the <a href="newmac.res.html">NEWMAC Outdoor Track and Field Championship</a> on Saturday at Mt. Holyoke College and win they did. Despite the unseasonably mid 80 degree temperatures, and the oven like atmosphere on the track that had an artificial turf field, the Engineers used depth on the men's side, and quality on the women's side to win their respective championships, the ninth in succession for the men and 10th over the 11 years the conference has been in existence and the second overall for the women. The final scores for the men were MIT 230, WPI 179, Springfield 151, Coast Guard 137, Wheaton 56 and Babson 14. For the women, MIT was first with 248 points, Springfield was second with 175, Wheaton 155, Smith 81, WPI 60, Babson 27, Mt. Holyoke 15 and Coast Guard with 9.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT had relatively few winners on the men's side. Stephen Morton '10, usually the star of this meet with two NEWMAC Athlete of the Year awards to show for it, was suffering from back pain and was not able to produce his usual top performances, although he did manage second place efforts in both the long jump and triple jump with leaps of 23-0 1/2 and 46-2 respectively. Wins were produced in the pole vault by Greg Tao '10, (15-10 1/2) and then all the events from the 1500 and up with Yermie Cohen '09 taking the 1500 (3:58.31), Richard Prevost '11, the 3000 Steeplechase (9:35.51), Dan Harper '12, the 5000 (15:51.86) and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, the 10K (33:11.64).</p>
  <p align="left">Most of Tech's points were scored using their depth in the distance events, the pole vault, high hurdles and pole vault. Overall, the field events were the weakest area for MIT, scoring only 77 points, 25 of which came via the pole vault. WPI scored 101 points in the field, owing mostly to their 1-2-3-4 sweep in the hammer throw, but also showed pretty good balance. </p>
  <p align="left">The goal for MIT, for both men and women, was to win with as slow of times as possible, saving themselves for the remaining championships and keeping in mind the high temperatures. This certainly held the times down in the longer races, particularly the 5K and 10, although this served MIT well as they scored a combined 89 points in the 1500, 3000SC, 5000 and 10K.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's focus was on Coast Guard, the team that had emerged as the strongest opponent last year and appeared on paper to be the biggest threat this year. WPI, typically in the lower half of the final ranking of teams, surprised many with their early lead that lasted halfway through the meet. MIT Coach Halston Taylor never even considered the strength of WPI, which in retrospect was seeded to score 168.5 points, making them the second seeded team going into the meet. MIT was seeded to score 249, but the absence of Morton and not scoring at the expected level in the 800, high jump, discus and hammer hurt the Engineers chances of beating their seed total. </p>
  <p align="left">In addition to those champions mentioned above, others receiving All Conference honors for MIT for placing among the top two were: Vlad Sobes '11, in the javelin, Morton in both the long jump and triple jump, Tony McDonald '10, Jake Ruzevick '09, in the 1500 and 5000, Paul Welle '11, in the 3000SC and Jack Bourbonnais '10, in the 10K. </p>
  <p align="left">The women entered the conference championship, whose rules only allow four entries per team per event, with only 24 team members. Their was some concern that the lack of depth might hurt the engineers, but the quality of performances more than made up for it. Showing a lack of strength in the field events certainly affected MIT's chances as Springfield College racked up the points, outscoring MIT 99 to 56, despite MIT taking 24 in the pole vault led by a new MIT record and a win by Emily Hwang '09, of 12-6 1/4. The track is where MIT prospered, winning every individual event from the 400 through the 10K as well as the 100HH and 4x100 relay, outscoring Springfield 192 to 76. The only running events the Engineers did not win were the 100, 200 and 4x400 relay.</p>
  <p align="left">In addition to Hwang, victors were Amy Magnuson '10, in the 100HH (14.48 into the wind), Portia Jones '12, in the 400 (57.69), Jamie Simmons '12, in the 400IH (66.04), Andrea Bradshaw '09, in the 800 (2:17.03), Katherine Eve '12, in the 1500 (4:45.03), Jacqui Wentz '10, in the 3000SC (11:05.56), Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, in the 5000 (18:50.01), Tania Morimoto '12, in the 10K (39:13.45), and Jones, Simmons, Margaret Leibovic '10, and Magnuson in the 4x100 (49.47).</p>
  <p align="left">Again, the times were somewhat slow as the strategy was to keep the pace slow if possible. In the 1500, Katherine Eve ran a 2:26 final 800 as the first 700 was very slow. Holt-Gosselin finished with a 37 second final 200 in the very slow 5000. Both of these kicks were necessary to secure the victories whereas in the 10K it was not a factor.</p>
  <p align="left">Other All Conference honorees were: Jones in the 200, Wentz in the 800, Jennifer Doyle '09, in the 1500, Liz Labuz '09, in the 3000SC and the 4x400 relay team of Martha Gross '12, Wentz, Kirsten Aarsvold '11, and Bradshaw. Not running Jones and Simmons in the 4x400 was just a matter of pulling back a little at the end of the meet since these women were already pretty fatigued. </p>
  <p align="left">The top point scorers for MIT in the meet were Magnuson and Jones for women, both scoring 23.5 points, while the injured Morton produced 18.5 points for the men.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT enters the New England Division III Championship, hosted by Springfield College. The decathlon is held Thursday and Friday, while the remainder of the meet is contested on Friday and Saturday.</p>
