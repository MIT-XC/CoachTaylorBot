  <p><strong><span class="style1">Engineers Set Five More NCAA Qualifying Marks at All New England Championship</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 8-9, 2009</p>
  <p align="left">After last weekend's record setting performances in the New England Division III Championship, MIT chose to rest many of its athletes, either giving them the weekend off from competing or limiting the number of events performed. The primary focus for MIT track and field now is preparing athletes for the NCAA Division III Championship, May 21-23. So, entering this weekend for the <a href="neicaaa.res.html">New England Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association Championship (NEICAAA) at the University of Massachusetts</a>, there was no effort or expectation from a team perspective, but there was a high expectation on individual performances. MIT came through in a big way with five new or improved NCAA qualifying performances, two new MIT records, one freshman record and nine personal or season bests. </p>
  <p align="left">Even without distance stars, Jacqui Wentz '10, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, and Jennifer Doyle '09, MIT's women still scored 37 points to finish in a tie for ninth place among all of the colleges in New England, finishing as the number one Division III team. Emily Hwang '09, once again failed to clear 13' by the narrowest of margins, settling for a rare second place at 12-3 1/2 in the pole vault. Teammate Karin Fisher '11, placed 6th with a vault of 11-5 3/4.</p>
  <p align="left">Hazel Briner '11, reset her own MIT record in the heptathlon with a score of 4049 points, setting an impressive personal best in the 100HH of 15.49. Briner placed 8th overall after a disappointing long jump caused her to lose a lot of ground after being in third after day one.</p>
  <p align="left">In the high hurdles, Amy Magnuson '10, won the 100HH in a season best 14.34, reaching the auto standard for NCAA qualifying. In the finals Magnuson hit two hurdles as she was being more aggressive in getting her lead leg on the ground. One of the hurdles, the sixth one, threw her off balance, costing her valuable time, letting her know she can definitely run faster. </p>
  <p align="left">Portia Jones '12, Jamie Simmons '12, and Kirsten Aarsvold '11, all ran the 400IH and all ran personable bests in the trials. Jones won her section in 62.45 while Simmons was the final qualifier for Saturday's finals in 64.22. Aarsvold did not advance but finished the season on a high note, running 66.55. In the finals, both Jones and Simmons got out well, but Simmons continued to have difficulty finding the rhythm of the event. She finished in eighth in 64.81. Jones ran very well, finishing in second in 61.82, bettering the NCAA auto standard and setting a new MIT standard in the event.</p>
  <p align="left">In the women's final event, Simmons, Andrea Bradshaw '09, Martha Gross '12, and Jones were trying for an improvement on their time of 3:56.16 in the 4x400. Needing a 3:53 or better to feel secure in qualifying for nationals, the team was determined to run their best. Simmons led off with her signature strong leg of 58.5 to put MIT towards the front of the pack. Bradshaw ran her best leg ever, turning a 58.2, handing off to Gross in 5th place, but within one second of the leader. Gross got a nice break at the handoff, but fell far behind in the first 200. However, she moved up well with a great second 200 to finish in 58.6, although MIT handed off in sixth place. Jones moved quickly behind the second through fifth runners and realized she needed to go around. Once she went around this group she started moving on second place, but ran out of track, finishing in third place, .08 behind UMass Amherst, in 3:52.03, setting a new MIT mark with that time and now own the sixth fastest time in NCAA Division III. </p>
  <p align="left">For the men, Paul Welle '11, stole the spotlight. Seeded with a best time ever in the 3000 Steeplechase of 9:28.79, Welle stepped up and raced for the victory despite losing his right shoe, the foot he usually uses to push off the water jump barrier. Coming through the mile in a very quick 4:58, Welle stayed up front, lasting until the final lap when the two leaders finally pulled away. Welle finished in third in 9:18.09, a solid NCAA provisional qualifying mark and ranked fifth on the all-time MIT list. </p>
  <p align="left">Stephen Morton '10, earned two sixth places in the long jump and triple jump but did not jump well in either. Morton's marks were 22-7 and 45-4 1/4, far from his best he delivered the week before.</p>
  <p align="left">Greg Tao '10, and Nathan Peterson '12, placed in the pole vault with jumps of 15-3 and 14-9 respectively, but neither vaulted their best. Tao placed sixth and Peterson eighth.</p>
  <p align="left">Two other men's performances deserve mention despite not earning any points. In the 1500, Yermie Cohen '09, ran a nice race, setting a personal outdoor best of 3:54.48, an NCAA provisional qualifying time. Running in the back, Cohen was in a section that came through the 400 in 60 seconds. Slowing at the half to 2:06, the pace again picked up in the third 400 with Cohen coming through in 3:07. He moved up well in the last 300 meters but ran out of track, finishing in 10th place.</p>
  <p align="left">Matt Bieniosek '09, closed out his MIT career with a personal best in the outdoor 800, running 1:55.18 in an excellent race.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT will be taking a few athletes to the ECAC Division III Championships next Thursday and Friday at Springfield College to see if a they can improve on their NCAA qualifying marks or just to fine tune going into the NCAA Championship the following week.</p>
