  <p><strong><span class="style1">MIT Engineers Victory Over RPI and WPI</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 5, 2008</p>
  <p align="left">The first meet of the season back in New England was a little warmer and a lot drier than expected and MIT took advantage by carving out a victory against RPI and WPI in the annual <a href="eng.res.html">Engineer's Cup</a> hosted by MIT with a score of 191 to 101 for RPI and 95 for WPI. MIT won 11 of the 19 events with Omari Stephens winning both the pole vault and the 110HH, Stephen Morton winning the 100 and 200 and Anthony Teixeira winning the long jump and triple jump for MIT's double event winners. The scoring went 7-5-4-3-2-1 for individual events and 7-5-0 for the relays. </p>
  <p align="left">Stephens won the vault with a season and outdoor best of 15-9. He was supported well as Greg Tao cleared a PR of 15-0 1/4 for second place and Patrick Barragan jumped a personal best of 14-3 1/4 for fourth place. In the high hurdles, Stephens pulled out the hard fought victory on the final hurdle in 15.30. Teixeira helped out by running 15.59 for fourth and Dave Fernholz placed sixth with a personal best of 16.13. </p>
  <p align="left">Teixeira only jumped in the trials of the long jump but that was enough for the win with a jump of 21-3 1/4. Without Stephen Morton in the event, Mattias Flander, Eric Beecher and Oliver Yeh took up the slack, placing third, fourth and fifth respectively. In the triple jump, &quot;Tex&quot; jumped 44-5 1/2 to win on his lasp attempt. Morton and Flander supported Teixeira'a victory with a second and third place. Obinna Anyanwu followed with a fifth place performance.</p>
  <p align="left">Morton sprinted to a 10.92 100 meter dash victory and was supported by Flander in fourth place. In the 200, Morton and Teixeira placed 1-2 with Morton running away with the victory in 22.26. Morton and Teixeira also teamed up with Nick Leonard and Anyanwu to win the 4x100 relay in a season best of 43.24. Overall, the sprint times were quite good given the 45 degree temperature.</p>
  <p align="left">Other MIT victories were led by a New England Division III leading performance by James Oleinik with a toss of 48-10 1/4. Kevin Kleinguetl took a small departure from his 800 and won the 400 with a time of 52.15. Dave Reshef was close behind in second place with a 52.34 performance. Richard Prevost knocked 20 seconds off of his debut in the 3000 Steeplechase with a 9:56.06 victory. Prevost was supported by Rocco Repetski in second place with a fine 10:14.85. The final MIT victory was in the 4x400 relay. Matt Bieniosek followed up his 1:57.71 second place in the 800 with a 52.1 leadoff leg. Reshef doubled back from his 400 with a 51.6 leg, handing off to Leonard who ran 53.8 to allow RPI to get very close. Kleinguetl prove equal to the task of anchoring as he ran a 51.5 for the victory.</p>
  <p align="left">One of the top efforts of the day went to Tony McDonald. The sophomore thrower threw a 153-6 personal best for third place in the hammer, a 43-3 1/4 personal best in the shot put for another third and 126-7 for third place in the discus.</p>
  <p align="left">One other performance of note was a personal best of 171-1 in the javelin by freshman Vlad Sobes. Sobes was leading until the final round.</p>
