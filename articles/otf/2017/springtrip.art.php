                  <h3>MIT Athletes Take Advantage of Spring Trip Meets</h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>March 31, 2017</p>
              <p>As is the case every outdoor season, the MIT Men and Women&rsquo;s Track and Field teams traveled out of the snow and cold of New England in search of warm weather and great performances to begin the 2017 outdoor campaign.&nbsp; Unlike recent years when MIT&rsquo;s cohort of sprinters, jumpers, vaulters, and throwers have traveled to Los Angeles to train at Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, this year&rsquo;s group traveled to San Antonio, Texas and was hosted by Head Men&rsquo;s and Women&rsquo;s Track and Field Coach Marcus Whitehead and his Trinity University teams.&nbsp; The weather was outstanding for the week, hitting the mid to upper 80&rsquo;s every day, and afforded Tech the opportunity to compete at a high level and get the outdoor season off to a fast start.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following a successful week of training, the entirety of the Spring Trip squad competed at the <a href="trinity_invite_results.pdf">Trinity Tiger Invite</a> hosted on Friday.&nbsp; For the throwers, however, their outdoor season began on Thursday at the <a href="final_results_bobcat_invitational_2017.pdf">Texas State Bobcat Invitational</a>, competing in the Discus for the first time outdoors.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p>At the Bobcat Invitational, the stage was set for the throwers to begin the season with a bang and get the Tech squads rolling into the weekend.&nbsp; Although the weather was perfect and the facilities and competition of mostly DI and DII athletes were fantastic, the meet officiating was far from it.&nbsp; In a Discus competition that saw seven flights of competitors take seven hours to complete, the MIT throwers would have their focus tested.&nbsp; That being said, they certainly stepped up to the challenge.&nbsp; The women competed first and were led by senior captain Jackie Vahey.&nbsp; From the third flight, Vahey &rsquo;17 was able to put together a throw of 132-06, a solid opener to her outdoor season in her signature event.&nbsp; After being told she did not qualify, but then realizing that they had only allowed six competitors to move on to the finals, the meet officials granted Vahey &rsquo;17 the finals throws that she earned.&nbsp; Although she did not throw farther, she was able to place 7th in a competitive field of athletes.&nbsp; Both Ari Slutsky &rsquo;18 and Felusho Jebutu &rsquo;20 also competed, throwing 112-01 and 102-00, respectively.</p>
              <p>On the Men&rsquo;s side, the trio of Albert Menio &rsquo;20, Jon Fakkema &rsquo;19, and Cody Bratten &rsquo;18 looked to keep the momentum going.&nbsp; Menio &rsquo;20 and Fakkema &rsquo;19 performed well, marking throws of 125-06 and 127-10, respectively, but had throws significantly farther that were not marked due to a 43.00m minimum mark standard set by the meet officials.&nbsp; Highlighting the throwers&rsquo; excellent start was Cody Bratten &rsquo;18.&nbsp; Bratten, a Discus specialist, came out firing, not only placing 5th in a talented field of competitors, but also improving his lifetime best by over a meter.&nbsp; Bratten &rsquo;18 unleashed a bomb of 160-08, placing him 5th all-time in MIT history and 5th in all of NCAA DIII so far this year.&nbsp; His distance would have qualified him for the outdoor championships in last year&rsquo;s field and could quite possibly do so this season. </p>
              <p>Next up, the full compliment of MIT technical athletes looked to build off of the tremendous start engineered by the throws crew.&nbsp; In what was easily the most beautiful day of the week, Tech looked to make a statement at the Trinity Tiger Invite.&nbsp; Once again, the throwers took it upon themselves to lead the way.&nbsp; In the first event of the day, the women&rsquo;s throwers took to the Hammer circle.&nbsp; Captain, Jackie Vahey &rsquo;17 demonstrated Tech&rsquo;s dominance by winning in convincing fashion.&nbsp; Vahey&rsquo;s throw of 173-02 was a huge personal best, is currently 4th in the country, and stands as the 2nd best mark in MIT history.&nbsp; In addition, Ari Slutsky &rsquo;18 launched a personal best throw of 162-11, which is currently 9th in the country and 5th all-time at MIT.&nbsp; In the men&rsquo;s hammer throw, Fakkema &rsquo;19 put on a show of his own, tossing a personal best of 152-10 on his way to another Tech victory.&nbsp; Menio &rsquo;20 also placed 7th in the event, with a throw of 125-01.</p>
              <p>In the Discus, Vahey &rsquo;17 came up with another great showing, improving upon her performance from the day before by throwing 138-01 for 3rd place.&nbsp; Slutsky &rsquo;18 kept pace, improving her previous day&rsquo;s performance by over 5m, finishing 4th with a throw of 131-01.&nbsp; On the men&rsquo;s side, Bratten &rsquo;18 didn&rsquo;t quite have the stellar performance of a day earlier, but finished 2nd with a solid throw of 153-04, right around his personal best of a season ago.&nbsp; Fakkema &rsquo;19, however, made the most of his second opportunity and threw a big lifetime best of 144-08, earning him 4th place.</p>
              <p>On the Long Jump runway, the jumps crew looked to keep Tech rolling.&nbsp; Following up her All-America campaign from the indoor season, Nneoma Okonkwo &rsquo;18 did not disappoint, dominating the field and winning the event with a leap of 19-00 &frac34;, giving Tech its third event win on the day.&nbsp; Okonkwo&rsquo;s jump currently ranks her 2nd in NCAA DIII.&nbsp; Jumpers Haley Strouf &rsquo;18 and Natalie Alper &rsquo;17 both posted strong performances as well, jumping 17-10 &frac34; and 16-11 &frac14;, placing them 3rd and 8th respectively.&nbsp; On the men&rsquo;s side, Tech competed without the talents of All-Americans Billy Ruschel &rsquo;18 and Arinze Okeke &rsquo;17, but had others step up in the process, resulting in three season&rsquo;s best performances.&nbsp; Specifically, Jason Villanueva &rsquo;18 set a new personal best leap of 20-07 &frac34; on his way to an 8th place finish.</p>
              <p>While the horizontal jumpers were having fun in the Trinity sand pits, the Women&rsquo;s Pole Vaulters owned the runway and placed 6 in the top 7 spots of the competition.&nbsp; Kari Stromhaug &rsquo;19 posted the best performance of the evening, vaulting 12-03 &frac12; on her way to victory.&nbsp; Stromhaug&rsquo;s season opener stands as the 4th best performance in MIT history, is currently 5th in the country, and may be enough to qualify her for the outdoor championship in May.&nbsp; Sophomore, Kathleen Brandes also posted a personal best performance, vaulting 11-05 &frac34; on her way to 2nd place.</p>
              <p>On the track, the MIT women&rsquo;s 4x100m relay was poised to clock a fast time in the warm San Antonio weather.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the relay comprised of junior captain Hannah Chen, Michelle Menkiti &rsquo;20, Gabriella Zak &rsquo;20, and Nneoma Okonkwo &rsquo;18, was doomed from the start.&nbsp; As Chen &rsquo;18 burst out of the blocks and was approaching the first baton exchange, Menkiti &rsquo;20 left much too early as she mistakenly was watching Trinity University&rsquo;s first leg enter the exchange zone.&nbsp; As a result, Chen was unable to pass the baton within the exchange zone, disqualifying the Tech relay team.&nbsp; The disappointment did not last long, however, as Chen &lsquo;18 quickly turned things around with her 100m hurdle performance.&nbsp; With a 2.1 m/s tailwind, Chen paced the field posting a personal best time of 15.01, .02 seconds faster than her previous best of a year ago.<br>
                Back to the throws circle, MIT&rsquo;s throwers looked to wrap up an incredible weekend with a competitive showing in the Shot Put.&nbsp; Ari Slutsky &rsquo;18 led the way for the women&rsquo;s squad, posting a season&rsquo;s best throw of 40-07 &frac12;, good enough for a 2nd place finish.&nbsp; On the men&rsquo;s side, junior Cody Bratten continued his stellar weekend by posting yet another personal best, taking 2nd place in the process with a toss of 48-07 &frac12;, which is currently 7th all-time at MIT.&nbsp; Fakkema &rsquo;19 and Menio &rsquo;20, once again performed well, throwing 44-04 &frac34; and 40-00 1/2, respectively.&nbsp; Dana Balek &rsquo;18 rounded out the throws performances, competing well in the women&rsquo;s javelin, throwing a solid 105-04 for 3rd place.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, on the track, Tech&rsquo;s sprinters took to the starting blocks.&nbsp; In the women&rsquo;s 400m race, Gabriella Zak &rsquo;20 got out to a fast start in the first 200m and although she struggled to hang on in the last 100m, posted a solid outdoor season opener of 60.36 for 3rd place.&nbsp; In the men&rsquo;s race, senior Danny Newman began his final outdoor campaign clocking a 51.45 and taking 7th place in the process.&nbsp; In the 100m, junior Nneoma Okonkwo and freshman Michelle Menkiti battled poor starts to post times of 12.63 and 12.65, placing them 3rd and 5th, respectively.&nbsp; In what was the highlight of the evening on the track for MIT, Hannah Chen &rsquo;18 and Gabriella Zak &rsquo;20 tested their mettle in the 400m hurdles.&nbsp; In her collegiate debut, Zak &rsquo;20 got out well in the first 200m, but once again struggled to maintain pace in the second half of the race, ultimately finishing 3rd in a time of 65.58.&nbsp; Chen &rsquo;18, a two-time All-American in the event, ran an incredibly well-paced race, hitting her hurdles in stride and easily cruising in for her second victory of the evening in a time of 61.19.&nbsp; Chen&rsquo;s performance was almost 4 seconds faster than the 2nd place finisher and currently places her atop the NCAA DIII list.&nbsp; To finish up the day on the track, Michelle Menkiti &rsquo;20 blazed a 25.48 in the women&rsquo;s 200m for 3rd place and a performance that is now 5th all-time in MIT history.&nbsp; Menkiti&rsquo;s time is now just .16 off the MIT freshman record held by multiple-time All-American, Portia Jones.</p>
              <p>Back in the sand, Tech&rsquo;s horizontal jumpers looked to make a statement in the Triple Jump.&nbsp; In the women&rsquo;s competition, Jasmine Jin &rsquo;20 looked to make a breakthrough and build off her strong freshman indoor season.&nbsp; Battling fouling issues early on which saw two 37-38&rsquo; jumps erased from her series, Jin&rsquo;s performance was promising yet disappointing as she was only able to manage a jump of 35-06 for 5th place. On the men&rsquo;s side, Tech&rsquo;s top performer Jason Villanueva &rsquo;18 built off of his earlier personal best in Long Jump with a huge leap and personal best of 46-06 in the Triple Jump.&nbsp; In addition, junior captain Ryan Prinster, who was returning from a hamstring injury, launched a solid short-approach performance of 44-02 for 4th place.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>In the vertical jumps, men&rsquo;s Pole Vault proved to be a bittersweet affair.&nbsp; Following disappointing no-height performances from Scott Cameron &rsquo;19 and Raja Rajcic &rsquo;20, Bobby Upton &lsquo;20 stepped up his performance to an unprecedented level for a freshman vaulter.&nbsp; Upton &rsquo;20 proved to be too much for the rest of the field as he vaulted to victory with a height of 15-09 &frac34;, shattering the MIT freshman record formerly held by Pole Vault standout, Nate Ball.&nbsp; Upton went on to attempt 16-01 &frac34;, a height that would likely qualify him for the outdoor championships in May, but narrowly brushed the bar with his chest on his final attempt.&nbsp; In the women&rsquo;s High Jump, senior captain Natalie Alper dominated the field on her way to another Tech event victory.&nbsp; Alper &rsquo;17 cleared both 5-01 and 5-03 on her first attempt, which proved enough for the win.&nbsp; Alper then attempted 5-5 &frac14;, clearing it on her second attempt and establishing a new outdoor personal best and MIT school record in the process.&nbsp; Alper then took solid attempts at 5-07, a national qualifying height, but was unable to clear.&nbsp; In Tech&rsquo;s final event of the evening, men&rsquo;s High Jump, freshman Chris Washington displayed true competitiveness and would not be denied the top spot.&nbsp; After clearing 6-00, 6-02, and 6-04, Washington &lsquo;20 found himself on his final attempt at 6-06.&nbsp; After two other competitors failed on their final attempt, Washington stepped up to his starting mark, approached the bar with confidence, and sailed over the bar with ease for Tech&rsquo;s 10th and final event victory of the evening.&nbsp; Washington finished his evening by brushing the bar with his left arm and narrowly missing 6-09 &frac12;, a height that would likely qualify him for the NCAA outdoor championship.</p>
              <p>In summary, this year&rsquo;s Spring Trip resulted in numerous personal and season&rsquo;s bests, 5 performances that are likely to qualify for the NCAA Outdoor Championships, an MIT school record, and an MIT freshman record.&nbsp; Next up, the Engineers of MIT will battle against the likes of Bates, Tufts and RPI in a scored quadrangular meet.&nbsp; Weather permitting; Bates College will host the competition in Lewiston, ME, which will be held on April 7th and 8th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
