                  <h3>Four Freshman Records Cannot Prevent Loss to Williams</h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>April 15, 2017</p>
              <p>Dual meets in collegiate track&nbsp;and field are a rare occurrence these days as most programs have lost sight of wins and losses, preferring to focus on small portions of their teams, getting those individuals to the respective terminal championship of the season.&nbsp; In order to get their athletes to their ultimate championship, generally the NCAA Championship, coaches feel they have to play the game of chasing performances&nbsp;by taking their athletes to the meets with the best competition.&nbsp; There lies the key word, competition.&nbsp; When two teams both want to win, particularly when those teams are rivals, and every member on those teams will do whatever it takes to score a point or cheer a teammate on to score a point, great performances happen because of that desire to win the meet.</p>
              <p>Despite missing&nbsp;a couple of key team&nbsp;members on the women's side (Maryann Gong '17, Bailey Tregoning '19), and more than a few on the men's side, MIT did not appear to have a good chance to win either meet against <a href="williams.res.php">Williams Collge</a>.&nbsp; However, great performances did happen and a very impressive team effort ensued.</p>
              <p>Scoring in a dual meet goes through four places, 5-3-2-1.&nbsp; While relays are supposed to be scored 5-3, the head coaches of both programs agreed to score them 5-0 so not team gets points for a potential walk-through.&nbsp; The men started with a nice come from behind victory as Jon Fakkema '19 threw a personal best of 156-11 in the Hammer Throw on his final throw.&nbsp; Chris Washington '20 cleared 6-6 in the High Jump, but lost on&nbsp;misses.&nbsp;Washington also came through with a personal best in the Long Jump, jumping 21-1 1/2, but that was only good for third place.&nbsp; Arinze Okeke '17, MIT's All America jumper is expected to start competing next week as he comes back from a broken fibula back in January, hopefully adding some strength to the horizontal jumps.</p>
              <p>On the track things started going Tech's way.&nbsp; Ben Freed '18 took the lead in the Steeplechase after the first 400 despite the 72 second pace and never looked back, cruising to victory in&nbsp;9:30.04.&nbsp;Rookie Brian Bates lost focus in the middle of the race and looked to be losing second place.&nbsp; However, if Bates is within striking difference with 400 to go, he finds the necessary focus to make a race of it.&nbsp; Fortunately his hurdle ability allows him to kick like that and the freshman made up a huge amount of time with a 30 second final 200 to take second 9:40.87 to 9:40.92.&nbsp; That will to fight inspired his teammates.&nbsp; In the 4x100 Relay, Danny Newman '17, Michael Amoako '19, and Henry Tareque '17 got the baton to  Tre Albritten '18, the two time All-America&nbsp;winner in the 200, who was making his competitive debut after injuring his hamstring in mid-February.&nbsp; Although getting the baton a few meters behind, it took Albritten less than half the straight to rectify the situation and sprint home with the victory in 43.11.</p>
              <p>The next event, the 1500 looked to be a strong one for the Ephs, but Matt Deyo '1G, fresh off his 10K attempt last week, showed his will to win.&nbsp; Coming off a 3:09 1200 pace, Deyo demonstrated some wheels as he went to the lead breaking up the front pack of Williams' runners.&nbsp; Although he was unable to hold onto the victory, his 3:55.46 was a significant personal best and earned his team second place, supported by Aidan Gilson's fourth place in 3:58.42.</p>
              <p>Although Chris Sweeney '18 was returning to compete for the first time since tweaking his hamstring at the end of the indoor season, he was not ready for any short sprints or the high hurdles.&nbsp; Luke Gray '18, primarily a decathlete, stepped up and took the victory in the 110HH with his 17.32.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Back in the field events, Bobby Upton '20 and Scott Cameron '19 went 1-2 respectively in the Pole Vault to help MIT stay close to their counterpart.&nbsp; The horizontal jumpers reversed the results of the Long Jump, taking the Triple Jump 1-2-4 for a&nbsp;9-2 edge in that event.&nbsp; Cody Bratten&nbsp;'18 led a 1-3-4 finish in the Discus Throw with his 157-0 winning throw.&nbsp; Unfortunately the Shot Put did not go the way the Engineers hoped, and Williams earned&nbsp;the 8-3 point result.</p>
              <p>The 400 Meter Dash was another turning&nbsp;point in favor of the Engineers.&nbsp; Tom Frejowski '19 and Michael Amoako  ran huge races to place first and second respectively, upsetting the Ephs.&nbsp; Frejowski ran 49.99 and Amoako 50.14.&nbsp;Newman, normally a 400 runner, raced the 100 since Albritten was not yet ready to come out of starting blocks.&nbsp; Newman got the job done, sprinting to an 11.27 victory.</p>
              <p>At this point, MIT was up 77 to 64.&nbsp; The 800 did a lot to even things up for Williams.&nbsp; Missing all but one of their top 800 runners, MIT simply got spanked.&nbsp; Williams swept the top five places, winning the event in 1:53.25.&nbsp; This put the score at MIT 77, Williams 75.</p>
              <p>Sweeney made his outdoor season debut in the 400IH and did not disappoint.&nbsp; He led gun to finish, winning in 56.65.&nbsp;Williams took second and third to make the event a wash.&nbsp; Tech stepped up big in the 200 as Newman led a 1-2-4 finish with Amoako claiming second and Acquah fourth.&nbsp; Newman's winning time was 21.99.&nbsp; Now&nbsp;the score was  MIT 91, Williams 82 with just the 5K, 4x400 and 4x800 to go.&nbsp;Going into&nbsp;the 5K, MIT needed six of the 11 points to seal at least a tie and three to set up needing only one of the two relays to win the meet.&nbsp; Having their two best distance runners, Deyo and Dennis Maloney '19 in the 1500 to protect their bodies after their 10K the weekend before, Tech was depending on their second tier runners, runners who were very motivated to get the job done.</p>
              <p>The pace was quick, led by the Williams' runners coming through the 1600 at 4:52.&nbsp; MIT still had three runners in contention&nbsp;and things were looking good.&nbsp;&nbsp;After 3200 meters it was clear Williams was going to win the event, but it also appeared MIT would get the next three places.&nbsp; However, that 4:52 first mile began to have its effect and the pace slowed.&nbsp; The second 1600 was 5:02, and although the Engineers held onto the pace, Williams had a runner making a ferocious charge to score.&nbsp; In the end, Williams was successful in placing first and second, but MIT secured the three points necessary to mean they only needed to win one of the two relays.&nbsp; Billy Woltz '20 place third in his 5K debut, running 15:29.57 and&nbsp;Steven Goldy '20 earned fourth in 15:30.19.</p>
              <p>After their performance in the 400 and 200 it appeared&nbsp;the Engineers would be able to take the 4x400 and secure the win, but Williams was very motivated.&nbsp; Amoako was suffering from a heal injury and did not feel he could go so Ken Acquah '20 would replace him.&nbsp; Brandon Corts '17 led off and delivered a solid 51.6 to put MIT slightly in the lead.&nbsp; Frejowski left a little early and had to slow to receive the baton, but stayed even with Williams with his 50.9.&nbsp; Acquah ran an outstanding leg, although he too left early and had to slow down.&nbsp; He did not give up despite being passed in the second turn, finishing just behind Williams in 51.2.&nbsp; Newman also left early, quickly falling behind by over five meters.&nbsp; Newman's mistake was thinking he could catch his opponent in the final straight, but the Williams runner had the same plan&nbsp;and had too much left, securing the victory 3:22.65 to 3:23.18.</p>
              <p>After getting swept in the 800, it appeared unlikely MIT would be able to win the 4x800.&nbsp; Bates led off, but struggled mightily in the second lap, producing a 2:07 leadoff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Deyo ran 1:59.0, Gilson 1:57.6 and Nathan Munet '19 a 1:59.3, MIT could not make up the early gap, losing the event and the meet 100 to 94.</p>
              <p>The women's meet had a similar pattern.&nbsp; Led by their outstanding throwers, Jackie Vahey '17 and Ariela Slutsky '18, MIT stayed ahead in the field events, as the duo placed first and second in the Hammer, Discus and Shot Put.&nbsp; Slutsky won both the Shot Put (38-7 1/2) and the Hammer (PR of 163-5) while Vahey took the Discus in 139-6.&nbsp; Vahey even joined Dana Balek '18 and Elise McCormack-Kuhman in the Javelin to secure a fourth place.&nbsp; Balek won easily with a PR of 123-5.</p>
              <p>Although Kari Stromhaug '19 was sitting out the Pole Vault due to a sore back and Kaitlyn Sparks '20 no-heighted, Kathleen Brandes '19 led Makenzie Patarino&nbsp;'19 and Jen Tylock '17 to a 1-2-tie for 3rd finish, winning in 11-7 3/4.&nbsp; The jumps did not quite go the way of the Engineers.&nbsp; Williams swept the Triple Jump despite Jasmine Jin '20 jumping a PR of 35-8 1/2.&nbsp; Williams' three All America high jumpers did their job, relegating Natalie Alper '17 to a fourth place finish.&nbsp; Although Nneoma Okonkwo '18 was able to win the Long Jump at 18-11 1/4, Williams put two athletes ahead of Haley Strouf '18, to secure second and third.&nbsp; MIT took the field events 50.5 to 26.5.</p>
              <p>However, Williams strength was in the running events, and when not at full strength that did not go in Tech's favor.&nbsp; Jenna Melanson '20 did her part, taking the lead early in the Steeplechase and disregarding everyone to win in 11:06.25, an MIT freshman record.&nbsp; Megan McCandless '20 continues her comeback from plantar fasciitis, running the steeple for the first time.&nbsp; Despite awful waterjump efforts due to substantial deceleration going into the barrier, she still placed third in 11:20.64.</p>
              <p>The quartet of Hannah Chen '18, Michelle Menkiti '20, Jane Reed '20 and Okonkwo delivered a huge blow to the favored Williams 4x100 unit.&nbsp; Although the first handoff was a big reach by Chen as Menkiti left a little early, the foursome ran a 47.76 to win in an impressive time.</p>
              <p>In the 1500, where Williams was heavily favored with the last minute scratch of Gong, went as expected.&nbsp; After a slow start (80), the pace picked up in the third lap as both Clemmie Mitchell '18 and Katie Bacher '20 came through in 3:52 after&nbsp;a 73 lap.&nbsp; The top two Williams' runners had more speed and sprinted away from Mitchell (4:46.79) and Bacher (4:48.90), who had to settle for third and fourth.</p>
              <p>Chen won the high hurdles in 15.11, Reed claimed second in a PR of 58.62 in the 400 and Chen returned along with Gabriella Zak '20 to place 1-4 in the 400IH.&nbsp; Chen, the third ranked intermediate hurdler in all of Division III won the event in 61.53.&nbsp; Zak went out too fast, has not yet learned to use her other lead leg and struggled home in 66.98.</p>
              <p>Menkiti had quite the day.&nbsp; In addition to her role in the 4x100, she placed second the&nbsp;100 in 12.40, breaking her own freshman record&nbsp;in the event and took third in the 200 in 25.12, another freshman record.&nbsp; The problem with the 200 was that Williams placed first, second and fourth to close the gap on MIT.</p>
              <p>Just prior to the 200 Marissa McPhillips ran an outstanding race, defeating many top Williams 800 runners with her 2:17.24 performance.&nbsp; So, going into the 5K, MIT was up 91.5 to 88.5 for Williams.&nbsp; Williams had two runners who had qualified for Nationals in the 10K the week before, was heavily favored to place&nbsp;take first, second and third as their third runner was a national caliber miler.&nbsp; Mary Eccles '18 was determined not to let that happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial pace was 5:48 for the 1600, which was not particularly fast, but not that slow either.&nbsp; The second mile pace picked up to a 5:37, but Eccles stayed right with the leaders.&nbsp; However, the third Williams' runner fell off the pace.&nbsp; Now the question was whether Eccles could break up the top two.&nbsp; After taking the lead with 900 meters to go with 83 second quarters, the Williams duo took off in the final 400 to easily go 1-2.&nbsp; Eccles ran an outdoor PR of 17:41.93.</p>
              <p>Going into the relays, MIT needed to win both to win the meet.&nbsp; While this again seemed unlikely, no one quit.&nbsp; In the 4x400, Reed led off with a 59.9 to hold a slight lead.&nbsp; Alper ran 59.8 to stay even and Zak ran 59.4 to bring the baton to Chen just five meters back.&nbsp; Chen produced her fourth outstanding performance of the day, touring the oval in 56.8 to win the event in 3:55.90.</p>
              <p>Just like the men, the 4x800 would decide the meet.&nbsp; MIT simply did not have the legs, but they did have the heart.&nbsp; Margaret Trautner '20 led off with a 2:27, but similar to the men, that put MIT six seconds in arrears.&nbsp; Bacher, already pretty gassed, ran a gutsy 2:22.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Melanson was totally out of her element, but ran 2:24.6 anyway.&nbsp; McPhillips came back and finished in 2:19.7, but could not make up the difference.&nbsp; Williams ran 9:18.91 while MIT finished in 9:33.66 to lose the relay and the meet.&nbsp; The one bright spot was that the performance was another MIT freshman record.</p>
              <p>Next week, MIT will host the Sean Collier Invitational, a non-scoring meet, and therefore will send a handful of runners to Princeton for the Larry Ellis Invitational.</p>
