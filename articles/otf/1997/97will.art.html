<FONT SIZE=4> With an extra week between the end of the regular
season and the Championships, the Men's Track Team went to the
Williams' Invitational.  The intent was to go to a non-scoring
competitive meet with good weather conditions.  Reality was a
rainy, wind swept, cold day. There was very little competition
because the coaches were worried about injuries the week before
the Division III Championships, and pulled many of their competitors
from the competition.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Nevertheless, MIT had many season and personal bests,
showing that they are ready for the Championships.  Qualifying
for next week's meet were Mike DeMassa '97 in the Pole Vault with
a season best of 12-09, and Mike Parkins '99 in the 5000 Meter
Run with a time of 15:05.4.  This was the first meet that Mike
did not run the Steeplechase.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Other bests were turned in by numerous competitors.
 In his first long jump of the season, Ravi Sastry '98 jumped
20-0.  In the Pole Vault, Dafe Ogagan '97 had a personal best
of 14-10 to win that event.  Dafe had three great attempts at
15-04, but did not quite make it.  Also in the Pole Vault, contested
inside due to the weather conditions, Andrew Jamieson '99 started
getting back to his Indoor form with a vault of 13-03 for a season
best.  Lincoln Bonner '97 put together a fine 400IH race in running
a personal best of 58.3, which probably will qualify him for next
week's Championships if he decides to run that event.  In the
800, Martin Suresh '99 came in 2nd with a personal best of 1:59.1.
 Also with a personal best in that race was Chuck Van Buren '98
with a 2:03.6.  Dan Helgesen '97, recovering from a month long
bout with sickness, ran a season best with a 2:00.5 performance.
 Neal Karchem '99 and Ashley Clayborne '99 had season and personal
bests respectively, running 51.1 and 54.6.  In addition to Parkins
fine performance in the 5000, was David Kelman's season best of
17:08.5.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The New England Division III Championships begin
on Thursday, May 9 at Tufts with the Decathlon.  Although MIT
does not have any decathletes, they will be contenders for one
of the three trophies given to the top 3 teams.  Without the full
services of injured Matt Sandholm '97, and Ravi Sastry '98, Tech
will have its work cut out for it.</FONT>
