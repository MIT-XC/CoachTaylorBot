RECORD<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> MIT's Mens Track and Field Team was at home Saturday
for the last time this season, hosting the final regular season
contest.  Their opponents were Springfield College, and the Coast
Guard Academy.  Going into the meet with an unblemished record,
MIT managed to continue their winning streak with a 103 1/2 to
81 1/2 to 18 score over Springfield and Coast Guard respectively.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Entering the meet, still without the services of
Senior sprinter, Matt Sandholm, the Engineers were about 8 point
favorites.  That is very little in a triangular meet where the
points awarded are 5-3-2-1 for 1st-2nd-3rd and 4th.  The Coast
Guard Academy was without the services of their fine sprinters
because of a service academy rule that maintains all of the academies
must send a 400 Relay Team to the Penn Relays.  This loss of sprinters
actually hurt MIT significantly more than Springfield.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> MIT prepared to double and triple athletes where
necessary in order to win the meet, but towards the end, was able
to back off and rest people as the win was secured with 2 events
to go.  With 27 season or personal bests, MIT athletes made certain
there were no doubts about the outcome of the meet.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Once again, the throwers were at a disadvantage,
this time due to the quality of the Springfield throwers, but
also because of two MIT throwers who were unable to compete. 
Fortunately, the jumpers enjoyed the exact opposite, a large advantage.
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The only score for MIT in the throws was from Pat
Dannen '98 in the Discus with a 4th place effort.  Coast Guard
was able to take some of those points so that Springfield enjoyed
a 35-1 advantage over MIT because of the throws.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> In the jumps, MIT swept the Long Jump, led by Dafe
Ogagan '97 with a 21-0 1/2 jump.  While not sweeping the Triple
Jump, Tech did secure 1st and 2nd place.  Morio returned to his
winning ways with a 43-1 1/4 leap, but the surprise was Sam Thibault's
first jump of the year of 41-10 3/4 to garner 2nd place.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The High Jump was not supposed to be very good for
Tech, but Ravi Sastry '98 returned from the injured list to jump
6-2, tying him for 3rd.  Typically one of MIT's best events, the
Pole Vault gave Tech 7 more points.  Dafe Ogagan won his second
event with a 14-0 vault and Thibault again jumped 13-6 to tie
for 2nd.  The jumps were won by MIT over Springfield by a score
of 23 1/2 to 9 1/2, bringing the field event total to Springfield
44 1/2 to Tech's 24 1/2.  Coast Guard was close behind, scoring
15 of their total 18 points.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The running events obviously went well for MIT,
and began accordingly in the 400 Relay.  Tech has not lost a sprint
relay the entire season, even though 6 different runners have
been in 4 different combinations, all due to injuries.  Once again,
MIT had great exchanges to bring home the victory in 44.25.  This
advantage was not so great because CG did not enter a team, giving
Springfield 3 points just for finishing.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> MIT boasts 2 of the top runners in the country for
Division III in the 3000 Meter Steeplechase, and Mike Parkins
'99 added to that by winning in 9:13.5 to qualify for the National
Championships.  Leif Seed '99, already qualified for the Nationals,
led Mike through the first mile before backing off to save energy
for a battle later in the day in the 800 Meters.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The 1500 Meters was basically a strategic race designed
to gain MIT the first 3 places and help one of those three get
a personal best.  Both feats were accomplished as Joel Ford '98
and Chris McGuire '00 paced Sohail Husain '98 to a personal best
of 4:11.6.  Those first 3 running events gave MIT a 23 to 7 edge
and brought Tech within 4 points of the lead.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The 110HH was a key event because Springfield had
the Indoor 55HH Division III Champion, and MIT had an undefeated
Lincoln Bonner.  Lincoln won out with a huge personal best of
15.35.  Dafe Ogagan claimed 3rd with a season best of 16.18. 
The score was now tied and Tech was on their way.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Both Springfield and Coast Guard were weak in the
400, so Coach Taylor added jumper, Alexander and middle distance
man, Dan Helgesen '97 to the event in hopes of a sweep.  True
to form, Neal Karchem '99 led the sweep, with Helgesen running
a surprising 51.67 to claim 2nd.  All four Tech runners (Karchem
51.36, John Kim '98 52.21, and Alexander 52.64) ran either personal
or season bests.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The 100 Meters went as predicted with Springfield
claiming 1st.  However, Bonner gained 2nd and Alim Needham '97
claimed 3rd with a 11.93.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The featured event of the day, the 800 Meters, did
not quite live up to it's billing.  Walsh of Springfield, a noted
1:53 half-miler who takes it out hard when he is not doubling
back from another event, did just that and pulled away with 200
meters to go.  Seed, who was supposed to go out with him, was
not having a great day after hitting his knee in the Steeplechase.
 He did go with him, but lost focus at 400 meters and faded to
1:58.20 for 3rd.  Ford charged hard at the finish to claim 2nd
in 1:57.92.  Edgar Ngwenya charged hard for 4th in 1:59.85.  Martin
Suresh ran a personal best with a 1:59.92, but did not place.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> With Seed in the 800, and Bonner in the sprints,
the 400IH race was left to Ogagan to try and defend.  Springfield
was supposed win the race and did.  However, Dafe did his job,
claiming 2nd with a best of 59.42.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The 200 race saw Bonner pay back, and reverse the
finish from the 100 Meter Race.  Lincoln ran 23.21 to defeat the
Springfield runner by nearly 3 tenths of a second.  MIT also placed
3rd and 4th with Karchem and Kim stepping up.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Chris McGuire ran his second race in the 5000 Meter
Run.  Instructed to run hard, McGuire started with 73 second quarters,
and finished the same, as his biggest deviation was 1 second.
 Chris ran 15:17.91 for yet another 1st place finish.  Frank Johnston
'00 finished the freshman duet with a personal best of 16:02.92
for 3rd.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The 1600 Relay was of little consequence, so those
who felt like running did so.  The unlikely team of John Kim,
Mike Parkins, Joel Ford, and Neal Karchem edged Springfield with
a very respectable time of 3:28.64.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Tech's next meet will be the Williams' Invitational
on Saturday, May 3rd.  Others at the meet will be Westfield State
and Middlebury College.</FONT>
