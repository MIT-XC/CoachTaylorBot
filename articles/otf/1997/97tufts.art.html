OVER TUFTS<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Based on Tufts' entries, the April 19 meet in the
cold and windy conditions at MIT, should have gone to Tufts. 
However, a couple of injuries combined with performances not close
to entered seeds were Tufts downfall.  MIT won every running event
and held their own in the field events to come away with a 99-64
victory to remain undefeated at 6-0.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The meet did not start well for Tech as Tufts went
1-2 in the Hammer and Discus to start the throws with a 16-2 lead.
 Due to the wet weather the jumps were contested inside.  Tufts
added to their lead with a triple victory from Rommel Childress
in the Long Jump, Triple Jump, and High Jump.  Trailing 14-31,
MIT began to put things together.  In the Pole Vault, Sam Thibault
'00, led the MIT sweep with a 13-06 vault.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Back outside, the running events were about to start.
 The first event was the 400 relay.  Still without the services
of Matt Sandholm, the 400 Relay Team was anchored by Dafe Ogagan
'97.  The consistently great handoffs of Brad Geilfuss 'G to Lincoln
Bonner '97 and Lincoln to Neal Karchem '99 once again put MIT
well in the lead going into the anchor leg.  Still safeguarding
his recent injury, Dafe cruised in to win.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Coach Halston Taylor made the decision before the
meet not to double any of the middle distance or distance runners.
 This meant that the fewer runners in those events had to get
the job done.  With that in mind, Mike Parkins '99 got things
started with an easy victory in the 3000 Steeplechase (9:46.8).
 The wind was so strong, the MIT runners forgot about times and
just went for the victories.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> In the same fashion, Leif Seed '99, not running
the Steeplechase for the first time this year, went up against
perennial national qualifier Mike Northrop of Tufts.  Both runners
sat behind the other pace setters until with 300 meters to go,
Leif decided he had waited long enough and kicked in with a 46
last 300 into the wind to win in 4:06.61.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> MIT was now within 6 at 33-39.  Tufts was heavily
favored to win the next two events, but someone forgot to tell
the Tech runners.  The first event was the 110HH, in which Lincoln
beat Tufts' Jesse Chertoff for the first time in over a year with
a fine time of 15.67.  Dafe followed in third with a 16.36 to
pull MIT within 3.  Neal Karchem '99 won the 400 for the first
time this season with a fine time of 51.68.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> With Matt out of the sprints, Lincoln was forced
to come back in the 100.  Brad had MIT's first false start this
year, but Lincoln came through with a 11.58 victory to put MIT
1 point behind Tufts.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The 800 has been a big event for MIT all season.
 To be certain that Tech was capable of handling the runners from
Tufts, all of the MIT runners were fresh.  Joel Ford '98 did not
disappoint as he won from behind in 1:59.02.  Martin Suresh '99
did an excellent job with a ferocious sprint down the home stretch
to pass Northrop of Tufts and garner second place. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Finally gaining the lead, Tech was not about to
give it up.  The only setback came with Tufts getting 1st and
3rd in the Shot Put, but that was quickly made up with a 1-3 effort
by MIT in the 400IH.  Leif led the way with a season best of 57.21.
 Dafe again tried a new event, and did so successfully with a
60.20 for third.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> In the 200, MIT put things away for good with a
Bonner, Karchem, Geilfuss sweep.  Lincoln and Neal had season
best times of 23.15 and 23.54.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Chris McGuire '00, the 4th leading scorer on the
team, followed the Tufts' runners for 3 miles of the 3.1 mile
race.  At times there were as many as 4 Tufts' runners surrounding
or leading Chris, but it did not seem to shake his confidence
in his ability to win.  With just more than 200 meters to go,
Chris started his kick, running the last 200 meters in 28 seconds,
and winning by 10 seconds in 15:33.27.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The Javelin and the 1600 Relay were both going to
finish at the same time.  For the first time in Coach Taylor's
memory, MIT swept the Javelin.  Rookie Chad Souke '99, throwing
for the first time, and after 1 practice with the spear, threw
148-1 to win.  George Torres '99, after placing 3rd in both the
Hammer and the Discus, moved up to 2nd in the Javelin.  Rounding
out the scoring was Andres Morin '99.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The relay, trying for a season best time, got things
off to a bad start as Edgar Ngwenya 'G led off with a 54.1.  Ford
made up the difference with a 52.6 and handed off to Seed, who
ran a 52.3.  Anchoring with his best leg of the season was Karchem
with a 51.5.  The 3:30.70 was far from a season best, but provided
a 4 second margin of victory.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> MIT's next meet will be the last home meet of the
season on April 26th with Springfield College and the Coast Guard
Academy at 1:00. </FONT>
