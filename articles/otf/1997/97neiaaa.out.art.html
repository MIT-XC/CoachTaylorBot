CHAMPIONSHIPS<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Due to exams and stiff standards, MIT Men's Track
Team only had 4 entries in this weekend's NEIAAA Championships.
 This is the only meet in the season where all NCAA Divisions
go head to head in a championship.  The format is a two day meet
with trials taking place on Friday and finals on Saturday except
for a few of the field events and the 5 and 10K.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Dafe Ogagan '97, and Andrew Jamieson '99 qualified
in the Pole Vault, but Dafe tore some cartilage in his knee last
week and Andrew wanted to prepare for exams.  Likewise, Leif Seed,
bothered by a tendonitis in his lower leg, did not run in hopes
that he will be able to race better at Nationals.  Entered athletes
who did not make the fields were Morio Alexander 'G, in the Triple
Jump with a 45-00 mark, and Joel Ford '98, in the 800 with a 1:55.44
time.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Those who did make it in were Lincoln Bonner '97
in the 110HH, freshman Chris McGuire in the 5000, and Mike Parkins
in the 3000 Steeplechase.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> On Friday, Lincoln, seeded 12th, ran the trials
and turned in a time of 15.45 to qualify for Saturday's Final.
 Also on Friday was the 5000.  The fast and slow sections were
combined and run at an earlier than usual time.  Neither Coach
Taylor nor Chris McGuire noticed the change printed on the seed
sheets.  Hearing over the loudspeaker, 20 minutes before the event
that it had been moved up, Chris immediately began his warmup.
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Chris warmup up okay and appeared ready to go, but
with 1 mile to go his stomach began to cramp from a late snack
and probably due to the rushed warmup.  He nevertheless ran his
second best time of the season with a 14:57.53, but was not his
usual self at the finish.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> On Saturday, Lincoln competed in the Finals.  He
had a pretty good start, but was off balance after the 2nd, and
3rd hurdles.  A slow trail leg was his problem on this his final
110HH race for MIT.  Lincoln placed 6th and scored with a time
of 15.47.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Last up for MIT was Parkins.  Mike was seeded 4th,
but with Seed out of the field, he moved up to 3rd seed.  The
race was a perfect pace for Mike, but later in the race he was
sloppy over a couple of water jumps, nearly stopping on the last
one.  He had taken the lead with 500 meters to go and held it
until the last 200.  The last water jump was the difference as
he lost by a little over 1 second, but finished 2nd in 9:12.78.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Going into this week's National Championships, Seed
and Parkins are seeded 7th and 8th respectively in the 3000 Meter
Steeplechase.  McGuire is seeded 7th in the 5000 Meters.  The
Steeplechase is contested on Wednesday and Friday and the 5000
on Thursday and Saturday. </FONT>
