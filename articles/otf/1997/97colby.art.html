TO REMAIN UNDEFEATED<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The Men's Track Team traveled to Waterville, Maine
this past weekend to face and defeat host Colby College, Bowdoin
College, Bates College, and the University of Southern Maine by
scores of 93 1/2 to 83, 63, 50, and 6 1/2 respectively.  MIT competed
without many of their top athletes.  Some of these were due to
injuries (Ravi Sastry, Matt Sandholm, Omar Saleh, and Mike DeMassa),
and others were due to absences (George Torres, Jason Dailey,
and Juan Carlos Fuenmayor-Soto)  Perhaps the key absence was Dafe
Ogagan missing the meet due to academics.  Coach Halston Taylor
estimates the team gave up 36 points which would have also taken
away 36 points from the opposition.  Scoring in the meet went
6-4-3-2-1.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The weather started out looking very promising,
but soon turned cold and windy, affecting many of the performances
of the day.  Nevertheless, numerous personal bests were established
by MIT.  Qualifying for the New England Division III Championships
in 4 weeks were Morio Alexander 'G in the Triple Jump (45-0),
Andrew Jamieson '99 in the Pole Vault (13-0), and Lincoln Bonner
'97 in the Long Jump (20-11 1/2), all winning their respective
events.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> MIT scored 0 points in the throwing events.  In
part, the blame should be placed on the three throwers who missed
the bus, but the quality of the opposing team's throwers may have
negated their effect anyway.  Possibilities existed for Tech in
the Javelin and the Discus, but it did not materialize.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> In addition to the jumps already mentioned, Morio
also placed 3rd in the Long Jump with 20-06 1/2.  Jared Miller
'98 place 5th in the Triple Jump with 39-11 1/2.  Leif Seed '99
just missed scoring in the Triple Jump, but added a tie for 4th
in the High Jump at 5-10.  In the Pole Vault, Sam Thibault '00
vaulted 12-6 for 3rd and Matt Potts '00 came in 4th at 12-0.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Fortunately, the runners were able to establish
some dominance in the distance events.  Leif won the Steeple once
again in 9:33.21 and was followed in 2nd by Mike Parkins '99 in
9:35.92.  Both ran casually until there was 800 meters to go.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> In the 1500, the next event, Chris McGuire '00 continued
his undefeated season in this race with a slow-paced, strategic
4:12.29.  Coming close behind in 3rd with a personal best was
Sohail Husain '98 (4:14.28), and Joel Ford in 4th (4:14.53).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> By the time the meet got around to the 5000, Tech
just needed to make certain that no one from Colby or Bowdoin
beat them.  A fatigued Parkins and McGuire did what was necessary,
placing 2nd and 3rd in 15:57.74 and 15:58.32.  Running a personal
best, just out of placing, was Frank Johnston '00 in 16:11.10.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The shorter events did not go very well for Tech
for the most part.  In the 100, Matt Sandholm thought he was ready
to go, but 30 meters into the race, the same hamstring injury
that caused him to sit our the New England Division III Championships,
recurred.  Brad Geilfuss 'G hung on for 3rd and Alim Needham '97
came through for 5th place.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> In the 200 Meters, knowing they would not have Sandholm,
Neal Karchem '99 and Geilfuss teamed up to get 4th and 5th in
23.72 and 23.79.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Karchem did much better in the 400, placing 2nd with
a season best 51.50.  John Kim '98 ran 53.22 to follow in 4th.
 The wind was having it's effect in these races.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The 800 Meters definitely did not go as planned.
 MIT was planning on sweeping 1,2,3 in the race, but ended up
getting 3,4,5.  Running out front, but not doing anything with
it, or falling too far behind were MIT's errors.  Tech's top two
runners, Ford (3rd) and Edgar Ngwenya 'G (5th), were still feeling
the effects of being sick during the week, while Martin Suresh
'99 (4th), simply lost focus and fell too far behind at the beginning.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The hurdle races went better, but not great.  Lincoln
had a great day, as he added to 110HH victory to his Long Jump
with a 15.75 effort.  Dave Ratliff ran a personal best of 17.86,
but did not place.  Missing Ogagan and Sastry really hurt in this
race.  The 400IH proved too much for Bonner.  Looking good until
hitting the 6th hurdle, Lincoln totally fell apart and finished
out of the money in 11th.  Leif ran a best (58.50), but not good
enough, as Colby went 1-2.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Next week, Tech hosts Tufts University on Saturday
at 1:00.  Last year, Tufts was the only team to defeat MIT.  </FONT>
