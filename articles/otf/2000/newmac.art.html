NEWMAC CHAMPIONSHIP</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>April 29, 2000</P>

<P>MIT Men's Track and Field team went into the 2nd annual NEWMAC
Championship as defending champions, and according to the seeds,
slight (5 point) favorites. However, Springfield College, fierce
competitors at home, proved that they can step up when necessary as
they defeated MIT by a score of 212.5 to 198.5. Coast Guard with 115,
WPI at 42, and Wheaton scoring 39 were the remaining teams.</P>

<P>Springfield's team has a base of throwers and sprinters, exactly
MIT's weaknesses. Conversely, MIT's strength within the conference is
in the 1500 and up, where Springfield is considerably weak. True to
form Springfield scored 78 out of a possible 112 points in the four
throwing events to MIT's 12. In the 1500, 3000 Steeplechase, 5000,
and 10K MIT scored 80 out of a possible 112 to Springfield's 9. The
difference came in the sprints where Springfield dominated to the
point of 37.5 to 8.5 in the 100 and 200.</P>

<P>MIT fell behind in some early events where they were expected to
do better, but came through very well later in the meet. Both teams
experienced many personal bests throughout the meet, but Springfield
appeared more ready for the challenge.</P>

<P>The first event was the 10K. MIT took advantage of their distance
strength and entered the maximum of 4 runners according to conference
rules. No other team had any entries, thus giving the maximum of 28
points to MIT. Hoping to save strength for next week, yet wanting to
run fast enough to qualify for the New England Division III
Championships next weekend, Liyan Guo '01, Ed Keehr '01, and Albert
Liu '03, went out at a pace that would bring them in under 35:00.
Keehr and Liu were returning later in the meet in the 5000 if
necessary, and did not go with Guo after the scheduled 3 mile mark
increase in pace. Guo won easily in 34:17.82.</P>

<P>The Long Jump, Hammer, and Javelin all began at 11:00AM for the
men. In the Hammer, Greg Walker '03, came through with a nice PR of
123-8 to snare 6th place on his last throw. The Long Jump was
supposed to net MIT 9 more points than Springfield, but instead
Springfield outscored MIT by 8. This 17 point swing would prove to
haunt Tech as the meet wore on. The Javelin went as expected for MIT
in that Nikos Michalakis '01, won, but there were some easy points to
pick up which Springfield did and MIT did not, netting Springfield 5
more points than they were seeded to score.</P>

<P>After these early events, the Engineers settled down and began to
produce fine performances. In the 3000 Steeplechase, Phil Loiselle
'01, Craig Wildman '03, and Sean Nolan '03 came through with 2nd,
4th, and 6th places respectively. Loiselle ran to a season best of
10:00.20, and Wildman cut his best by over 20 seconds with a 10:05.00
4th place performance.</P>

<P>MIT's lack of sprinters was evident in the 400 Relay. Still making
adjustments with their new lineup, MIT's first two handoffs left a
bit to be desired as Springfield and Coast Guard ran away with the
first two places. The 100 trials did not go well either. Marc
Washington '03, and Robbie Gray '02, ran personal bests of 11.40 and
11.44 respectively, but Springfield held the first three qualifying
positions. In the final, MIT surprised by placing 4th and 5th, taking
the 3rd place away from Springfield.</P>

<P>Fortunately, the 1500 was next. Sean Montgomery '01, and Chris
McGuire '00, were surprised by a very fast early pace of 62 at the
400 and 2:05 at the 800. The pace did not slow at the 1200 in 3:08,
but Montgomery picked it up anyway, finishing his last 300 in 46 to
run a national qualifying performance, and meet record of 3:54.66 on
this windy afternoon. McGuire ran to a 4 second PR of 3:56.58 for 3rd
place. This is certainly bad news for McGuire's 10K opponents at
Nationals.</P>

<P>Another event which did not go well for Tech was the 110HH. MIT
was supposed to score a 3rd and 5th in the race, but instead received
4th and 6th. Unfortunately, Springfield stepped up and won the event
when their runner was seeded 2nd.</P>

<P>MIT hoped for breakthrough performances in the 400 and High Jump,
but that turned out not to be the case. Yuval Mazor '02, led the way
for MIT in the 400 with a 50.31 personal best of 4th, but Sabol from
Springfield won the event. Likewise, freshmen Craig Mielcarz and
Brian Hoying hoped to improve their great marks of 6-8 and 6-6
respectively, but it was not their day as they both cleared a very
respectable 6-6 while the Springfield jumper made 6-8.</P>

<P>Events that went well for MIT came toward the middle part of the
meet. The Pole Vault went very well as Dan Kwon '02, jumped 13-0 1/4
to tie for 2nd with the Springfield jumper. Matt Potts '00, and Dan
Opila '03 contributed for 4th and 5th respectively. The Triple Jump
proved another source of good fortune when the Springfield jumper
seeded 4th fouled out. MIT jumpers took advantage with 3 season
bests. Kalpak Kothari '01 leaped 44-08 1/4 for 2nd, Junius Ho '01,
41-09 1/4 for 4th, and Robbie Gray with a 6th place 40-07 effort.</P>

<P>The 800 and 400IH looked like they might be pivotal events for MIT
when Sean Montgomery (1:53.88), John Biesiadecki '01 (1:58.05), and
George Hanson '03 (2:00.99), upset Springfield for a 1st, 3rd, and
6th in the 800 to score a 4 point swing on Springfield. The
intermediates provided similar results as Tony Pelosi '01, Peter
Bluvas '01, and Mielcarz placed 3rd, 4th, and 5th to get 1 more point
than they were seeded.</P>

<P>With only the 5000 and 1600 Relay to go, MIT was down by 33
points. Coach Taylor made the decision to go ahead and double back
the 10K runners as well as Sean Nolan '03, from the Steeplechase, and
McGuire from the 1500. The hope was that if MIT could sweep there was
still a slim chance that Springfield might get disqualified in the
relay enabling MIT to win the meet. As it turned out, Keehr and
McGuire were able to place 1st and 2nd pretty easily, but Springfield
had a runner who ran a big season best to claim 3rd, thus clinching
the victory for the home team.</P>

<P>In the finale, the foursome of Mazor, Todd Rosenfield '01, Matt
Lehman '03, and Montgomery ran a comfortable 3:19.93 to win going
away.</P>

<P>Coach Taylor took the blame for his team's loss. "Whenever our
track team does not respond to a championship challenge like this one
it is the head coach's fault for not properly preparing and
motivating the team."</P>

<P>Next week, the Engineers travel back to Springfield for the New
England Division III Championships. Those contending for the title
are Springfield, MIT, and Williams College.</P>
