<P>March 27, 2000</P>

<P>As usual, the Spring Trip was built around; building camaraderie,
rewarding those individuals who most contributed to the success of
the team in Indoor Track who were also participating in Outdoor Track
and Field, and a warm weather location for great training and
competition.</P>

<P>Success was found on all fronts. The first four days, our
contingent of seventeen athletes and three coaches stayed in
Claremont, CA. The coaching staff at Claremont Mudd Scripps was kind
and hospitable enough to allow us to use their track and weight room
facilities at our convenience.</P>

<P>We arrived on Monday evening too late for much more than a warmup.
On Tuesday, after pracitce, we made a trip down to Huntington Beach
to join our host Neal Karchem '99, for a great day of volleyball,
frisbee, football, body surfing, and a super barbeque on the beach.
The entire team really apprectiated Neal's generosity and
hospitality.</P>

<P>After Thursday's practice, the team took a trip to Santa Barbara
to spend a day on the beach, and eat dinner at Junius Ho's parent's
Chinese restaurant. In addition to the truly awesome food, the Hos
made the entire team feel like family. They also invited Payton
Jordan, the 1968 Olympic Coach for Track and Field, and long time
Stanford University coach, along with his wife, and Mrs. Duffy
Daugherty, the wife of the famous ex-football coach of Michigan
State, both now local friends of the family. Great track and field
stories went well with the fabulous dinner.</P>

<P>On Friday, after practice, we headed down to San Diego. On
Saturday, the team went their separate ways after a light practice.
One group went to Tijuana while another group went to watch a local
track meet at Point Loma. Both groups met up at UCSD to observe the
elite Discus competition. UCSD has perhaps the greatest discus
throwing area in the world. Headwinds blow off the ocean to the
elevated throwing area where amazing distances are achieved. This day
was no exception as we witnessed a new NCAA record by Gabor Mate of
Auburn University finishing third overall in the competition. First
and second were earned by Adam Setliff and Andy Bloom respectively at
224-9 and 224-7. World Champion, Anthony Washington did not make the
finals.</P>

<P>Saturday saw the rest of the competition, including all the events
we were scheduled for. We had some remarkable performances given the
brief time we have been working in Outdoor Track. Chris McGuire '00,
led the way with an automatic qualifying effort in the 10K. Waiting
until 6:00PM to race, Chris lost patience quickly with the pack and
made a move to catch the leader, Ronaldo Da Costa, of Brazil, the 2nd
fastest marathoner of all time. Chris succeeded in catching him and
them proceeded to take the lead for the next 4 miles, each under
5:00. Falling behind in the final 2 laps, Chris nevertheless did not
slow down, running 73-74 seconds for every lap after the very first
quarter of the race. Chris finished in second with a time of
30:56.06.</P>

<P>Provisional national qualifying marks were made by Nikos
Michalakis '01, in the Javelin and Craig Mielcarz '03, in the High
Jump. Nikos put every throw in the 190-194 range, finishing with a
194-7 effort. Craig, having hyper-extended his knee in the Long Jump,
was not certain he would be able to High Jump. Coming in early, Craig
jumped better as the bar went up. At 6-8 he had plenty of clearance,
and had a very good attempt at 6-10, but failed to clear that
height.</P>

<P>Other fine efforts were put in by many MIT competitors. Sean
Montgomery '01, competing in the 800, won with a 1:53.06 performance.
Our 400 Relay team of Todd Rosenfield '01, Robbie Gray '02, Yuval
Mazor '02, and Marc Washington '03, ran a superb 43.96. The amazing
part is no one in that foursome can run faster than 11.60 in the open
100. Not bad for 2 weeks of practice with handoffs.</P>

<P>Brian Hoying was nominated by his teammates for the performance of
the meet, as he cleared 6-6 in the High Jump with a full arm cast due
to some wrist surgery he had three weeks ago.</P>

<P>Freshman, Sean Nolan, put in two fine performances. He ran a
15:32.76 in the 5000 to lead the day off, and finished the day, 6
hours later with a 10:04 first time performance in the
Steeplechase.</P>

<P>Overall, we qualified 3 for nationals, and 6 for the New England
Division III Championship. Next week we start the regular season with
a home meet versus RPI and WPI in the Engineer's Cup</P>
