5-0</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>April 8, 2000</P>

<P>MIT Men's Track and Field team traveled to Brunswick, Maine today
with their 2-0 record to take on Bowdoin (runners-up in the New
England Indoor Division III Championship), Colby, and the University
of Southern Maine. They left with a 5-0 record in a fairly close meet
with Bowdoin, outscoring the Bears 249 1/2 to 229 1/2. Colby and
Southern Maine finished with 138 and 52 points respectively.</P>

<P>The weather, which was supposed to include rain and colder
temperatures, cooperated with sunshine and 60s. This allowed for some
better performances, but overall, it looked like the Engineers were
not very psyched up for the competition.</P>

<P>Once again, MIT was led by the jumpers as they scored 67 1/2
points out of a possible 81 in the Long, Triple, and High Jumps. The
new NCAA scoring format for quadrangular meets awards 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1
points for 1-8 places, allowing up to 4 individuals to score from a
team per event. Craig Mielcarz, 03, led the way with 24 points as he
won the High Jump (6-6), placed 3rd in the Long Jump with 20-0, and
also scored in the two hurdle events with a 6th in the 110HH and a
3rd in the 400IH. Also doing well in the jumps was Junius Ho '01, who
scored a 2nd in the Triple Jump with a 40-0 performance, a 4th in the
Long Jump, and also won the 110HH in a best of 15.73. Kalpak Kothari
'01, won the Triple Jump with a 42' effort on the uphill approach
with the additional challenge of the landing area being higher than
the takeoff board due to the sand being higher than the borders of
the pit.</P>

<P>In the middle distance events, Sean Montgomery '01, showed his
All-America form despite suffering through a stomach problem the last
half of the week. Sean took the lead in the 1500 with 700 to go,
running the final 600 meters in 1:33 to win easily in 3:58.42. Sean
came back in the 800, taking the lead with 400 to go, running 55
seconds on the final lap to finish 20 meters in front in 1:54.86.
Also performing well in the middle distances were Chris McGuire '00,
with a 4:01.84 2nd place PR in the 1500, and a 5th and 6th place
finish from George Hanson '03, and Matt Yarosz '00, running 2:01.97
and 2:02.28 respectively in the 800.</P>

<P>There were a few other key performances in the meet. Perhaps the
most outstanding of those performances was Ed Keehr's '01, 15:08.72
victory in the 5000. Ed's time was a 31 second PR. Kevin Atkinson's
'02,  8th place finish in the 100 was nearly a .4 personal best, and
his start was not particularly impressive. Freshman Greg Walker threw
two personal bests, with 113' efforts in both the Hammer and Discus.
Peter Bluvas '01, improved 6 feet in the Discus with a 121'01"
effort. Of course, in the Javelin, Nikos Michalakis '01, won his
event with a throw of 197-2.</P>

<P>Next week, the Engineers travel to Medford to face the Jumbos of
Tufts and UMass Lowell in what promises to be a very challenging
meet.</P>
