DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP</B></FONT>

Running</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>May<B> </B>6, 2000</P>

<P>MIT went into the New England Division III Championship this
weekend seeded 4th and that is exactly where they finished with 70
points, behind host Springfield's 123, Williams' 96, and Bates' 83.
It was the first time in four NE Div. III Championships that MIT
finished so low in the team scoring. After the Indoor victory, it was
assumed by many that MIT would continue it's streak given the youth
of their team, but misfortune paid a visit to the Engineer's, forcing
them to wait until next year to win another title.</P>

<P>When provisional national qualifier, Dan Feldman '02, decided to
forego the outdoor season in favor of the Boston Marathon, the team
thought they could rally and get the job done. When Rick Rajter '03,
the leading point scorer from the indoor season, came down with a
season ending stress fracture due to a structural imbalance in his
foot the team still thought if things went well they would have a
chance. But in the final week, when Peter Bluvas '01, last year's
decathlon runner-up, held a 104 degree fever for three days, and
Kalpak Kothari '01, last year's Triple Jump champion, developed a
heel bruise when landing incorrectly on his 2nd phase during last
week's conference championship, the team realized it was not in their
immediate future to win the title.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, the team went to Springfield to get the job done.
Chris McGuire '00, started things off in the 10K with an easy victory
in the balmy 80+ degree, humid weather. Chris, having already
qualified for the National Championship later this month, and
planning on running a fast 5K next weekend, just ran to win, doing so
by 27 seconds in 32:04.67.</P>

<P>In the Long Jump, Tech was seeded for 2 points. Junius Ho '01, set
a PR with a leap of 21-7 1/4 to steal 6th place and Robbie Gray '02,
came through with a 20-10 1/2 effort for 8th place and a total of 4
points. At the same time, the Javelin was going on, but Nikos
Michalakis '01, was not having a good time of it. Nikos came into the
meet with a sore shoulder and elbow, and during warm-up, strained his
obliques. Nevertheless, he took two throws before pulling out, good
enough to secure 3rd with a 193-4 throw, one place lower than his
seed.</P>

<P>One of the best events for MIT was the 400 Relay. Tech was seeded
12th with a 43.96 and set to run in the slow section. MIT was
convinced they had worked out the problems with their new line-up and
were ready to run well enough to not only win their section, but also
place. Robbie Gray came over from the Long Jump and provided a fine
lead off leg, but just missed the first attempt at handing off to
Kevin Atkinson '02. They connected a split second later, apparently
not losing any speed through the zone. Kevin's handoff to Yuval Mazor
'02, was perfect, allowing Yuval to move up to 2nd, behind Tufts
coming into the final handoff. Yuval called for the pass a bit too
soon, causing Marc Washington to run with his hand back too long.
However, once Marc received the baton, he walked down the Tufts'
anchor, finishing in 42.95 to not only win their section, but also
place 6th, only .01 out of 5th place.</P>

<P>Craig Mielcarz '03,  did not live up to his 7th seed in the Long
Jump, but he more than made up for that by coming through in the High
Jump. Craig was not looking good during warm-ups, and did not jump
well at his opening height of 6-3, but as the competition went on,
Craig improved. Only two jumpers cleared 6-7, and Craig did so in
less attempts. At 6-9 1/2, Craig had two good attempts, but did not
make it. In addition to the victory, Brian Hoying '03, added a
6th.</P>

<P>The 1500, another event we were expected to win, was not going to
be as easy as the 10K. Sean Montgomery '01, was undefeated all
season, nevertheless his victory was not guaranteed. The pace started
out slow with 64 first quarter. Gradually the pace picked up with a
2:07 800, with Sean sitting in 2nd place. The third quarter picked up
significantly as Matt Twiest from Bates, leading from the beginning
tried to break up the field. Coming through in 3:08, freshman Mark
Miller from Keene State, took over and picked up the pace. Sean was
still following until there was 200 to go. At that point Sean tried
to take the lead but was held off by Miller until the final straight.
Finally, with 100 to go, Sean pulled into the lead, winning with a
3:52.04 performance.</P>

<P>Junius was up again, this time in the 110HH Final. Junius had a
poor start in the trials but finished strong in 15.77. In the finals,
he came out well, but was not sprinting well between the hurdles.
Nevertheless, Junius finished in 7th, 2 places up from his 9th
seed.</P>

<P>In the 400IH, Tony Pelosi '01, was ready to improve on his 55.94
PR in the trials earlier in the afternoon. Tony somehow got out a
little off, and for the first time this season came to the first
hurdle with 23 steps instead of his usual 22. Tony can hurdle well
with both legs, but the change through him off enough that he tried
to get back on the correct leg, causing him to struggle and fatigue
too early. Tony faded in the final 100, running 57.54 for 8th.</P>

<P>MIT was favored to score 4 points in the Pole Vault, an event the
Engineers had three entrants in. Matt Potts '00, and Dan Opila '03,
both cleared the first two heights to put themselves in good scoring
position. Matt, struggling all year, came through when it counted
most with a 13-3 1/2 personal best for 4th place. Dan finished in 6th
place to give Tech 8 points in the event.</P>

<P>Ed Keehr, was seeded 6th in the 5000, but when the early pace went
out quickly in the high temperatures, Ed began to fade. Normally very
consistent, Ed started running 78 second pace after the first mile
and a half, and by 2 miles was up to 80 pace, and about to lose
possession of 8th place. Somehow, Ed found a way to get it back. With
2 1/2 laps to go, Ed started coming back. He ran a 78 quarter to
start to move up on the 6th and 7th place runners. Ed's next lap was
a 69 as he blew past the runners and into 5th place. Another runner
caught Ed despite his continued kick, leaving Ed with his predicted
6th place in 15:35.68.</P>

<P>The final event, the 1600 Relay, looked to be hotly contested with
many possible sub 3:20 performances. Instead, the heat during the day
wore everyone out, resulting in no teams breaking 3:20. MIT started
off with Mazor who brought the baton home in 50.0 and just behind
Colby College. Todd Rosenfield '01, went out hard, taking over the
lead and pulling away until the 200 mark. Amherst College and Colby
were coming up strong in the end with Amherst pulling slightly ahead
at the handoff. The handoff from Rosenfield, who ran a 50.4 leg, to
Matt Lehman '03, was not very good, which put Lehman behind Amherst.
Matt worked too hard to pull into the lead, causing him to fatigue
too much at the end, which allowed Amherst to finish even up, with
Springfield and Colby close behind. Montgomery had a great handoff to
take a quick lead. Down the back straight, the Amherst runner put
some pressure on Sean who responded by pulling away and never looking
back, finishing in 49.6 to bring the team to victory in 3:20.28.</P>

<P>Next week, the Engineer's travel to UConn for the All Division New
England Championships.</P>
