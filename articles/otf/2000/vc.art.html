EARLY</B> <B>DUE TO POOR WEATHER CONDITIONS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>April 21, 2000</P>

<P>The weather in Springfield, MA at the Vern Cox Invitational was
the cause for some teams not to show up at all, and others to pull
competitors out of events due to safety concerns. MIT coach Halston
Taylor, sent his team home after four events, indicating that one
week before the start of a series of championships was too close to
risk injuries and illness in a meet that was non-scoring. Rain
pooring down, cold temperatures in the 40s, and gusting winds were
too much in a meet schedule that was predicted to be at least 4 1/2
hours in length.</P>

<P>The purpose of this meet for MIT was to improve performances to
qualify for the various championships upcoming in the next 5 weeks.
Tech jumpers started things off in the Long Jump with marks that
could hardly be called improved performances. Robbie Gray '02, Craig
Mielcarz '03, and Junius Ho '01, all jumping 21' 6" or better this
year, could do no better than 20' 2". In addition, the jumpers, in
hopes of getting out of the rain, were just huddling under an
umbrella inbetween jumps rather than properly prepare for their next
effort. Although they all made the finals, the team left prior to the
start of those finals.</P>

<P>The 3000 Steeplechase was the first running event. Phil Loiselle
'01, and Craig Wildman '03, made the most of the situation and ran
well. Craig ran a personal best with a 10:26 effort. MIT withdrew
their 400 Relay team in fear of pulled muscles then ran all middle
distance and distance runners in the 1500 before leaving for
home.</P>

<P>Nikos Michalakis '01, competed in the first round of the Javelin
at the same time the Long Jumpers were competing. Nikos managed a
180' 2" effort despite the conditions, but was certainly in risk of
injury during the plant and block phase of his throw, and held plenty
in reserve.</P>

<P>Coach Taylor said it was the first time in his 21 years of
coaching that he has had a team leave a meet before it was over. "One
other time in poor weather conditions I resisted the urge to pull my
team and we lost our two best sprinters for the remainder of the
season with severe muscle pulls. I could see this happening again,
and 1 week prior to the start of our championships made it not worth
the risk."</P>

<P>Next week, MIT returns to Springfield to defend their crown as
NEWMAC Champions against a favored Springfield team that is always
tough at home.</P>
