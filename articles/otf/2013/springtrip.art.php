              <p align="left">March 30, 2013</p>
              <p align="left">The MIT Track &amp; Field team took 16 men and 16 women to California during the school's Spring Break for an opportunity to train the technical folks (throwers, jumpers, vaulters, sprinters and hurdlers) in warm weather, bond a bit as a team and complete the week with a competition at <a href="springbreak.res.pdf">Westmont College</a>. Everything went well with the exception of the meet itself. Competing without two thirds of the runners on the team, the men placed second among six teams with 77.5 points and the women finished third among seven teams with 60.5 points</p>
              <p align="left">The weather, unlike the rain and relative cold of the past two years, was perfect, with temperatures in the 70's each day and sunny skies. The team had great training, quite a few bonding opportunities with a beach trip (surfing and volleyball), the annual skits, a game of assassins and excellent dinners hosted by alumni and parents.</p>
              <p align="left">The meet started off very well for MIT as Logan Trimble '13 won the 3000 Steeplechase in 9:49.85. He went out a little too fast with a 70 first 400 and then slowed too much in the final laps, although he was very aggressive on the barriers. Trimble showed much improved hurdle technique over last year. He finished with a 37 final 200, which included the water jump and another barrier, so he certainly had plenty left.</p>
              <p align="left">In the next event, the 4x100 relay, the women's quartet of Jackie Brew '14, Veronica Szklarzewski '15, Michelle Johnson '15 and Jackie Konopka '15 did pretty well for only having two weeks of handoff practices, but there is certainly room for improvement. Their 50.72 was competitive for this time of year, placing third. The men led off with Michael DuPlessis '14 who ran an excellent turn, but caught Josh Duncavage '13 earlier than expected. Duncavage ran a solid leg given his tenuous hamstring, but not full speed. Nevertheless MIT was tied for the lead as Duncavage had to wait on Adrian Samsel '16 to make it into the handoff zone. Samsel also ran a solid leg, keeping even with the Westmont team. Tyler Singer-Clark '14 received the baton slightly behind his opponent, looked as though he might pull off the victory, but was unable to gain an advantage. The 42.67 was an excellent time given the difficulties and projects for a sub 42 come championship season.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 1500, Sarah Quinn '16 and Allison Hallock '16 were expected to score pretty big for Tech. Quinn took the lead at the gun despite directions to the contrary, hit the 200 pretty slow (41) and sped up too much to come through the 400 in 74. She continued to push the pace for the second quarter, hitting the half in 2:25. She slowed in the third quarter, hitting another 74, which was the expected pace, but then faded a bit due to the fast middle, ending in 4:36.82, which smashed the MIT rookie record. Hallock did not come to race and it showed as she fell off the pace immediately, going from 77 to 84 and then 86 before waking up and competing the final 100 meters to preserve sixth place and score a point for her team at 5:02.32. Justin Bullock '14 took the lead right off the bat. Unfortunately for him and the team, he cannot pace well and hit the 400 in 60. He slowed in the next 200 and two opponents snatched the lead, leaving Bullock in their dust as they hit 2:02 and then 3:05. Bullock was fine at 2:04, but then the wheels fell off as he ran 3:14, and finished out of the scoring in 4:09.22.</p>
              <p align="left">The 400 was next on the track. Katharina Ross '16, splitting time with the jumps, was unable to be competitive with the other runners, clocking 65.46, but placing fourth. Singer-Clark was seeded second and delivered on that seeding even though the time was not very fast at 49.77. His first 200 was too slow, so even though he caught all but one runner in the final 200, he did run out of space to complete the job.</p>
              <p align="left">It was at this point that things started going south for the Engineers, at least on the track. In the High Hurdles, Jackie Brew did not have a great race, running 15.50, but placed sixth. Jackie Konopka was having a lot of problems with her ankle, so the hurdles just were not happening. After a 20.66 the coaches pulled her from her remaining events. On the men's side, Brian Djaja '13 injured his hamstring during warmups, probably ending his final season. Adrian Samsel, running in one of his seven events as he prepares for the decathlon, ran a solid 16.19 for third place and Jordan Mizerak '15, also a multi-eventer, ran 17.89.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 100, both Duncavage and DuPlessis were tentative about their chronic hamstring issues and decided not to race in the 100 and 200, ending any chance the men had of defending their win in 2012. Szklarzewski and Stephanie Birkhimer '14, ran 12.94 and 13.20 respectively, Szklarzewski placing fourth.</p>
              <p align="left">Jackie Brew's debut in the 400IH was pretty solid. She got out well, cruising through the first five hurdles in good shape. On the sixth hurdle she went to her weak leg and did not focus on pulling her trail leg through, which caused her to land off balance. That deceleration was not good when she needed to be the most aggressive, but she held on well to finish in 65.69. While the 400IH is Adrian Samsel's best event, he was a bit too mentally and physically beat for a great race. He got out slower than usual, coming up on his weaker leg and having to chop to do it. This continued for three hurdles before he got his race going. By this point the race was over. Richard Lu '16, racing for the first time since his indoor injury back in January, ran better than expected, falling off a bit at the end to finish just behind Samsel. Their times were 59.19 and 59.27 respectively.</p>
              <p align="left">Hallock doubled back in the 800, and was more competitive, but still not where she should be. Her 2:31.81 was good for another sixth place. Bullock and Trimble also doubled back and raced superbly. The 400 was relatively slow at 58 for the leaders. Both Bullock and Trimble started towards the back of the lead pack and moved up nicely to hit the 400 mark in 58 and 59 respectively. Bullock took the lead a little prematurely but was pulling away on the backstretch while Trimble continued to move towards the front of the chase pack. In the final 100 Bullock lost the lead and was unable to fight back all the way, but earned second in 1:56.15. Trimble closed well to tie for third in 1:57.05--pretty respectable for distance runners in the first outdoor meet.</p>
              <p align="left">Szklarzewski and Ross raced the 200 for MIT, running 27.48 and 28.89 respectively for the women. With DuPlessis and Duncavage out, only Singer-Clark represented Tech in the 200. Not in late-season form, he was only able to gain third place in 22.56.</p>
              <p align="left">Quinn was pulled from the 5000, even though she was by far the top seed, due to not wanting to risk any damage to her calves, which are still healing from the indoor season. Likewise, MIT pulled the men's 4x400 relay team as the total number of events was catching up to the athletes and not worth the risk of injury.</p>
              <p align="left">In the field events, actually in the entire meet for MIT, the top performances were delivered by the Pole Vaulters. Lauren Kuntz '13 started where she left off Indoors as National Runner-up, matching that height of 12-11 1/2 to win this meet and certainly qualify for outdoor nationals. Cimmy Virdi '16 cleared 11-5 3/4 and was very close to getting 12-0. Joanna Chen '15 cleared 10-6 and Sherry Wan '16 cleared 10-0. Cyrus Vafadari '13 won the event for the men, clearing 15-5 and nearly getting 15-11 on a borrowed pole. Yida Gao '13 took second with a personal best 14-11. Mizerak placed fifth at 11-11 3/4. Samsel's pole vault debut earned him a clearance at 9-0 1/4.</p>
              <p align="left">There were not too many more high place honors for Tech in the field events. Michelle Johnson took fourth place at 36-5 3/4 for the women in the Triple Jump, and was supported by Birkhimer (34-11 3/4), Szklarzewski (34-3) and Ross (32-9 1/2). Carrington Motley '16 led the way for the men with a jump of 42-11 3/4. Angel Echevarria '16 managed 42-10 1/4 while Arinze Okeke '16 jumped 42-2 3/4.</p>
              <p align="left">Isabella Stuopis '16 took second in the Shot Put with a put of 40-11 1/2, quite a bit off her indoor best, but still an MIT freshman record. Konopka threw 33-2 and Tilly Taylor '15 30-0 1/4. For the men, Alex Noakes '16 earned a point for MIT with his sixth place finish at 41-4 1/4. Curtis Shoyer '16 threw 35-6 1/2.</p>
              <p align="left">In the Long Jump, Brew jumped 17-2 3/4 for fifth place and a nice start to the season. After that the Engineers were 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and 17th. In order, Johnson 16-2 1/2, Szklarzewski 15-10, Birkhimer 15-7 3/4, Wan 15-7 1/4, Konopka 15-6 1/2 and Ross 15-2 1/4. Motley again led the men, jumping 21-6 for second place honors. Okeke jumped 20-6 1/4, Samsel at 19-11, Echevarria at 19-4 and Mizerak at 18-10.</p>
              <p align="left">Both Mizerak and Samsel  jumped 5-10 3/4 to place third and fourth in the High Jump. The women's High Jump did not go so well as Preethi Vaidyanathan only managed 4-11 and Konopka was unable to jump.</p>
              <p align="left">Tilly Taylor placed third in the Javelin, but only threw 120-7, far off her best. Stuopis and Riocci both made finals but neither placed, throwing 107-3 and 106-3. Curtis Shoyer placed fifth with 159-7. Mizerak and Samsel continued their decathlon training, throwing 108-7 and 88-5.</p>
              <p align="left">In the Hammer Throw Stuopis placed fifth with a throw of 107-1 and Riocci placed sixth at 105-6. On the men's side, Shoyer threw 122-8 to place sixth. Noakes just missed placing with his 115-3 effort.</p>
              <p align="left">Stuopis also placed in the Discus even through she only threw 106-3. Noakes also placed sixth on the men's side with his 119-5 throw.</p>
              <p align="left">Next week the Engineers are back home hosting RPI and WPI in the Engineer's Cup. They will certainly need to step up their level of competition if they are going to be successful against the better teams in New England during the early weeks of the Outdoor sesaon.</p>
