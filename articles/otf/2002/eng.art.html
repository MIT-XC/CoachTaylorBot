2-0</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Anderson, Khan and Washington Each Claim Two
Wins</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>April 6, 2002</P>

<P>Brian Anderson (800, 1500), Chris Khan (Hammer, Discus) and Marc
Washington (100, 200) each won two events to lead their team to
victory with 214 points in the annual Engineer's Cup against RPI
(148) and WPI (33). The scoring in the tri-meet went 7-5-4-3-2-1 in
individual events and 7-4-0 in the relays.</P>

<P>In both the 800 and 1500, Anderson uncharacteristically ran from
behind until 300 meters remained, when he unleashed a strong kick to
win both events easily. Washington also won by coming from behind.
Although, you would not expect it in the sprints, Washington spotted
his opponents a large, but obviously not insurmountable lead before
moving past just before the finish line. Chris Khan, not challenged
in either event, threw a season best in the Hammer with an effort of
169-1, but struggled in the Discus as he only threw 134-5.</P>

<P>Going into this meet, MIT was less than certain of a victory, as
many team members were not available, primarily due to illness and
injury. Those missed the most were freshman sprinter, Zach Traina,
2001 NCAA Hammer qualifier, Marios Michalakis and jumper/hurdler,
Victor Williamson. However, veterans and rookies alike, stepped up in
the 45 degree, windy conditions to provide more than enough points to
win the meet.</P>

<P>MIT also earned 6 other victories in the meet. In the High Jump as
Craig Mielcarz cleared 6-4 while going back and forth to the Long
Jump, where he placed 2nd with a 21-1 1/2 effort. In the 110HH, Rick
Rajter ran 15.52 to lead the Engineers to 16 of the 22 points
available in that event. Matt Lehman, nursing a sore groin, led a
1-2-3 finish in the 400 with a 50.80 performance. Mark Jeunnette came
from way behind in the 400IH to win in 57.64. Sean Nolan came back
from a 2nd place in the 1500 to easily win the 5000 in 15:32.62. The
quartet of Alan Raphael, Jeunnette, Anderson and Rajter combined to
win the 1600 Relay in 3:27.93.</P>

<P>Next week, the Engineers are at home against Bowdoin and Division
II rival, UMass/Lowell at 11:00.</P>
