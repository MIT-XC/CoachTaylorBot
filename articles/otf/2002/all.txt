    ECAC MEET**
    
    
    
    Amid final projects, final classes and preparing for final exams,
    MIT Men's Track team sent a contingent of their provisional national
    qualifiers to Springfield College to participate in the ECAC Division
    III Championship. Although none of the Tech competitors improved
    their marks, all but one placed and competed well, giving the team a
    4th place finish with just 7 competitors.
    
    
    
    
    
    For all practical purposes, with the exception of a couple of
    schools, the ECAC Division III Championship is just a last chance
    qualifier for the NCAA Division III Championship. Nearly all
    colleges, with the exception of MIT and a couple of others, are
    finished with the exams, and are probably not going to house students
    and send them to the meet just for the sake of placing in the
    meet.
    
    
    
    
    
    First up for MIT was the Pole Vault. Nathan Ball was looking to
    improve on his freshman record vault of 15-7 1/4 and make his
    qualification for nationals automatic. Nate started at 14-3 and had
    no misses through 15-3. Two of his vaults at 15-9 were over the bar
    but due to his not shooting straight up the pole, he knocked the bar
    off with his chest on the way over. Although he was leading up
    through 15-3, the winner eventually cleared 16-0 to pass Nate.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the Hammer Throw, Chis Khan elected to bow out to focus on the
    Discus. Marios Michalakis and Greg Walker competed to try and improve
    on their best marks of the year. Marios had trouble staying in the
    circle in the finals after leading the trials with a 173-3 effort.
    Marios did not improve on his trials mark and finished in 2nd place.
    Greg was not able to handle the final week shift from two turns to a
    toe turn and two turns with the hope of gaining the necessary speed
    to throw 10 feet farther and finished with a 159-4 throw.
    
    
    
    
    
    On day two, the High Jump led things off. Craig Mielcarz stayed
    home to practice feeling his 6-10 1/4 mark would get him in the NCAA
    meet. Brian Hoying needed to improve on his 6-8 mark. After
    struggling through 6-7, Brian had two great attempts at 6-9 1/2 but
    did not make it. Coming into outdoor track after spraining his ankle
    during basketball season did not give him enough time to get ready
    for the NCAA Championship.
    
    
    
    
    
    Ben Schmeckpeper needed to give it one more try in the 3000
    steeplechase. Realizing he was the top seed and deciding to take the
    lead to make things happen, Ben uncharacteristically shouldered much
    of the burden and he paid for it. Ben struggled after the mile mark
    and could only manage a 9:32.85 for 5th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sean Nolan rested on his 5000 time and worked on speed in the
    1500, joining Brian Anderson who wanted to improve his mark and
    racing comfort. A slow pace worked against both runners. Sean held on
    to 3rd place but only managed a 4:01.06 time. Brian paid for a
    difficult academic week and struggled to a 4:06.35.
    
    
    
    
    
    Chris Khan finished the competition for MIT with the Discus throw.
    Chris had some good warmups, showing the 170 mark is quite possible.
    However, in the competition he could not finish his good throws
    without fouling and ended up in 5th with 148-5.
    
    
    
    
    
    The athletes will wait and see who gets in to the NCAA meet and
    perhaps get one more opportunity to improve their marks and become
    All America honorees. The NCAA Championship will be held at
    Macalaster College in Minneapolis May 23-25.

    **MIT WINS ENGINEER'S CUP TO GO
    2-0**
    
    
    
    **Anderson, Khan and Washington Each Claim Two
    Wins**
    
    
    
    
    
    April 6, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    Brian Anderson (800, 1500), Chris Khan (Hammer, Discus) and Marc
    Washington (100, 200) each won two events to lead their team to
    victory with 214 points in the annual Engineer's Cup against RPI
    (148) and WPI (33). The scoring in the tri-meet went 7-5-4-3-2-1 in
    individual events and 7-4-0 in the relays.
    
    
    
    
    
    In both the 800 and 1500, Anderson uncharacteristically ran from
    behind until 300 meters remained, when he unleashed a strong kick to
    win both events easily. Washington also won by coming from behind.
    Although, you would not expect it in the sprints, Washington spotted
    his opponents a large, but obviously not insurmountable lead before
    moving past just before the finish line. Chris Khan, not challenged
    in either event, threw a season best in the Hammer with an effort of
    169-1, but struggled in the Discus as he only threw 134-5.
    
    
    
    
    
    Going into this meet, MIT was less than certain of a victory, as
    many team members were not available, primarily due to illness and
    injury. Those missed the most were freshman sprinter, Zach Traina,
    2001 NCAA Hammer qualifier, Marios Michalakis and jumper/hurdler,
    Victor Williamson. However, veterans and rookies alike, stepped up in
    the 45 degree, windy conditions to provide more than enough points to
    win the meet.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT also earned 6 other victories in the meet. In the High Jump as
    Craig Mielcarz cleared 6-4 while going back and forth to the Long
    Jump, where he placed 2nd with a 21-1 1/2 effort. In the 110HH, Rick
    Rajter ran 15.52 to lead the Engineers to 16 of the 22 points
    available in that event. Matt Lehman, nursing a sore groin, led a
    1-2-3 finish in the 400 with a 50.80 performance. Mark Jeunnette came
    from way behind in the 400IH to win in 57.64. Sean Nolan came back
    from a 2nd place in the 1500 to easily win the 5000 in 15:32.62. The
    quartet of Alan Raphael, Jeunnette, Anderson and Rajter combined to
    win the 1600 Relay in 3:27.93.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the Engineers are at home against Bowdoin and Division
    II rival, UMass/Lowell at 11:00.

    **MIT SHINES AT HUSKY
    INVITATIONAL**
    
    
    
    **16 Season Bests Highlite
    Meet**
    
    
    
    
    
    April 20, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT track and field athletes responded well to the competition
    Saturday at the Husky Invitational hosted by Northeastern University,
    by throwing, running and jumping to 16 personal or season bests in
    the non-scoring meet. The Hammer and the 800 were the events
    showcasing the most improvement. 
    
    
    
    
    
    Chris Khan led the way in the Hammer with another personal best
    and automatic qualifying mark of 184-8 to move up to a ranking of #3
    in the country for Division III. Marios Michalakis followed suit with
    a 176-8 throw to move up significantly in the national standings.
    Greg Walker nearly joined the national qualifiers, throwing 163-8 to
    miss national provisional qualifying by 8 inches. Finally, Scott
    Bradley added nearly 3 feet to his personal best, throwing 134-3.
    
    
    
    
    
    Alan Raphael ran a superb race in the 800, just losing his section
    at the finish, but running a best of 1:57.53. George Hanson, knocked
    7 seconds off his season best, running 2:01.21. Taku Iida set a PR
    for the second week in succession, even splitting a 2:03.34 to win
    his section.
    
    
    
    
    
    Due to the headwind, there were no personal bests in the sprints
    or 110 hurdles on the soft track. In the 1 lap events, Gabe Sanchez
    showed he his on his way back in the 400 as he ran a season best of
    51.96 and Mark Jeunnette knocked two more tenths off his 400 IH
    performance, running 56.30.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the 3000 Steeplechase, Ben Schmeckpeper showed he is getting
    more and more comfortable with his new event. In his third steeple
    ever, he lowered his personal best by another 10 seconds, running
    9:38.22. In other distance events, Liyan Guo ran a season best of
    15:58.61 behind the winning effort of Sean Nolan who ran 14:54.83 in
    a strategic event that showcased Sean's speed as he ran a 30 second
    final 200. Albert Liu ran his first 10K of the season, producing a PR
    of 32:49.71.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the jumps, Victor Williamson leaped 20-3 for a season best in
    the Long Jump, Rick Rajter started looking better in the High Jump
    with a 6-4 effort and Dan Kwon vaulted 14-0 at his favorite meet
    site.
    
    
    
    
    
    Dale Cotton had the performance of the day, three times setting
    new PRs, finishing with a 19' improvement to 180-11 in the Javelin
    Throw. Greg Walker had his second PR of the day when he threw 127' in
    the Discus Throw despite a light rain.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the Engineers will see if they are ready to defend
    their NEWMAC conference title against powerhouses, Wheaton College,
    Springfield College and the Coast Guard Academy. The meet will be
    hosted at MIT's new track with the first events beginning at 10:00
    AM.

    **MEN'S TRACK FINISHES WITH 2 ALL-AMERICA
    WINNERS**
    
    
    
    May 23-25, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    Even though nine different athletes on the MIT Men's Track and
    Field team qualified provisionally, only four actually were accepted
    into the NCAA Championship field. Of the four, only one was favored
    to score, but two came through, scoring 5 total points and finishing
    in a tie for 47th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    As usual, the MIT team was more of a dual meet team, as indicated
    by their 7th national ranking in the power rankings, which give a
    cumulative score based on the top two performers per event. The young
    team, no seniors among the nine provisional qualifiers, was
    successful to a point, but not quite good enough to make a strong
    showing at the NCAA Championship.
    
    
    
    
    
    Craig Mielcarz, for the second year in succession, led the team
    with the top score, a fifth place in the High Jump. Craig made first
    attempts at 6'5, 6'7 and 6'9 to put himself in a strong position to
    repeat his 2nd place performance from 2001. However, even though his
    final two attempts were excellent and near clearances, he failed to
    clear 6'11. Four made 6'11 and two of them made 7'1 to highlight the
    quality of Division III.
    
    
    
    
    
    Chris Khan, qualified in both the Hammer and Discus, competed in
    the Hammer first. He was seeded fourth entering the competition with
    a throw of 180'. In the trials he was only able to get off a throw of
    172-7 to enter the finals in 8th position. He improved his mark to
    176, which temporarily moved him into 7th, but was passed back to end
    up in 8th. In the Discus, Chris was not able to throw beyond 154-5 in
    the trials, which missed finals by one performer. His second throw, a
    toe foul, would have been over 160'.
    
    
    
    
    
    Brian Anderson debuted in his first individual effort at nationals
    and did well to make finals with a 3:56.17. In the finals, Brian ran
    well, taking the lead after 600 meters and holding it until 400 were
    left, but he could not hold on and dropped to 11th as the leaders ran
    57 seconds for the final 400.
    
    
    
    
    
    Nathan Ball had a fantastic freshman season, but was not able to
    put the icing on the cake at nationals. Opening at 14-7, a
    comfortable height for him, the strong tailwind and his speed from
    rested legs caused him to blow through the poles he was accustomed
    to. Not feeling comfortable going to a heavier pole, he was unable to
    manage the speed and failed to clear the opening height. 
    
    
    
    
    
    With all qualifiers returning next year, along with a couple of
    very talented freshman, MIT hopes to make a stronger showing at next
    year's championship at St. Lawrence University in upstate New
    York.

    **MIT FINISHES 2ND TO STRONG WILLIAMS TEAM
    IN NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
    
    MAY 2-4, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    Despite three individual victories and 10 personal bests, MIT
    Men's Track and Field team was not match for a very strong team from
    Williams College. MIT's 122 points ranks as the highest total in
    history for a 2nd place finish, but that was little consolation for
    the Engineers who were hoping to perform a little better and for
    Williams performers to not compete at their best level--neither
    happened as Williams scored 169.5 points for the title.
    
    
    
    
    
    Peter Bluvas got things rolling for Tech with a 2 day Decathlon
    victory in very unfriendly conditions that has 50 mph winds, a little
    rain and even a snow flurry. The highlight of the event was a 22
    vault effort to jump 12-7 1/4 for a new PR in the vault. Bluvas
    finished with 5732 points for a career best. Ossinger from Williams
    placed 5th to make the score 10-4 after 1 event.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT has 31 athletes competing in the meet, a new record, but most
    were seeded outside the top 4. Nevertheless, Tech had finalists in
    every event with trials (100, 110HH, 200, 400, 400IH). In the first
    final of the day, the 10K, MIT was seeded 8th with Albert Liu, but
    failed to score. Williams placed 2nd and 7th to garner 10 more
    points.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Long and Hammer were the next finals to take place. Craig
    Mielcarz and Tom Hoover placed 5th and 6th in the Long Jump despite
    the head wind. While Williams scored 0 points in the LJ, that was not
    the case in the Hammer. Richard Chau of Williams had a big PR to
    place 2nd, just ahead of Chris Khan, 182-10 to 182. Marios Michalakis
    placed 6th for MIT and Greg Walker had a PR of 165-1 for a new
    PR.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next in the field events were the Triple Jump, High Jump and Pole
    Vault. Austin Neudecker was leading the triple after the trials with
    his 44-4 jump into the headwind. However, the last two rounds brought
    out some great performances, most notably a 2nd place effort of 44-9
    by Dwight Ho-Sang of Williams, which combined with a 5th place by his
    teammate put MIT behind for good.
    
    
    
    
    
    The High Jump, going on at the same time, had very good results
    for MIT. Mielcarz placed 2nd with 6-9 3/4 and was supported by a 4th
    place from Brian Hoying and a 7th from Rick Rajter. Williams finished
    below their seed with only a tie for 8th.
    
    
    
    
    
    Nathan Ball continued his assault on the freshman pole vault
    record, moving into 2nd place all time on the MIT vaulting list with
    his 15-7 1/4 winning vault - again into a wind. Ball was not
    supported by his vaulting mates on this particular day, although
    Bluvas came back to set another best of 12-11. Williams had a vaulter
    place 2nd who was favored to win, but Tech was favored to score 12,
    so the net result was the same.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the Discus, the anticipated battle between last year's winner,
    Chris Khan from MIT and the nation's leading Division III thrower,
    Dan Austin of Williams never materialized as Khan had difficulty
    staying in and was only able to place 4th with a throw of 152-1, 8
    inches out of 2nd.
    
    
    
    
    
    The other field events were not scoring ones for MIT, but Williams
    managed 29 points in the Shot Put as they placed 1-4 to close out the
    meet.
    
    
    
    
    
    The first final on the track after all the trials was the 400
    Relay. MIT's quartet of Zach Traina, Rajter, Yuval Mazor and Marc
    Washington ran a PR of 42.75 to place as the fastest time for MIT
    since 1990. The PR gave them 4th place, just behind Williams.
    
    
    
    
    
    The next event, the 3000SC saw two MIT entrants not attack the
    start enough to get into the race. Ben Schmeckpeper, a freshman who
    was seeded 5th, moved up in the lst half of the race to place 5th in
    9:34.74, but again, Williams College placed higher than they were
    seeded when Karl Remsen won in 9:08.99 and Zach Blume finished in
    8th.
    
    
    
    
    
    Brian Anderson continued to run very well as he took a fast pace
    and made it faster when after trailing in 2:05, he ran a 60 second
    400 to come through the 1200 in 3:05. Anderson never looked back as
    he ran to a new PR of 3:53.04 despite the windy conditions. The
    bigger surprise was turned in by Sean Nolan. Nolan was seeded 5th
    with a best of 4:00.27. Moving hard in the last 150, Nolan challenged
    last year's national champion, Mark Miller of Keene State before
    finishing in 3rd with a 3:55.64 to provisionally qualify for
    nationals. Williams was seeded to score 0, but managed 4th with a
    gutsy 3:56 from Matt Winkler out of the slow section.
    
    
    
    
    
    Rick Rajter was not able to put all his ailments behind him, but
    put enough on hold to finish in 4th with a 15.21 into the wind.
    Rajter, hoping at the beginning of the season to qualify for
    nationals in this event, will give his back a much neede rest to see
    if the swelling around his spine can go down.
    
    
    
    
    
    Yuval Mazor ran a PR of 49.67 in the trials, joining Matt Lehman
    in the finals of the 400. Mazor placed 4th in 49.87 and Lehman 6th in
    49.95. The 8 points was 2 below what was expected. Williams also lost
    2 from their predicted seeds as thier 1st seed finished 2nd.
    
    
    
    
    
    Zach Traina could not match his wind aided 10.91, but he did
    manage to place 5th after being seeded 4th. Williams, seeded to score
    13 in one of their strongest events, managed 16 as they finished 1st
    and 3rd. The 200 was much the same as Traina placed 6th and Williams
    scored 13.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 800 was another bright moment for Tech. Alan Raphael, on a
    mission all season, came out of nowhere to place 2nd in a PR of
    1:54.15. Anderson tried to come back, and managed to go with the
    leaders through the 54 first quarter, but was not able to recover
    enough in the 40 minutes between races to do better than 1:58.
    Williams, seeded to score 26 points, finally had a bad event as they
    only scored 11.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 400IH saw two MIT runners make the finals, but 7th and 8th was
    all that was managed, although that was higher than they were seeded
    to score. Russ Moriarty ran a PR of 55.97 in the trials, but placed
    behind teammate Mark Jeunnette in the finals.
    
    
    
    
    
    Williams won the 1600 relay in 3:16.85, a fine time in the wind.
    MIT could not manage to score with their 3:27.02 as all their entries
    had already spent themselves in previous races.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, Tech goes to Northeastern University for the All New
    England meet on Friday and Saturday. Last year, MIT placed 9th
    against their foes from other divisions, but hope to place higher
    this year.

    May 9-11, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    The final two weeks of classes combined with a long season
    conspired to end most of MIT's track team a week early, causing them
    to miss the All New England Championship. Usually a very strong meet,
    equal or greater than the Division III Nationals, the meet was
    weakened without the presence of UConn and the Ivy League colleges.
    Even with the weaker competition, MIT was only able to place 10th
    overall with 26 1/2 points. 
    
    
    
    
    
    Tech had two personal bests and two season bests as they prepared
    for the NCAA Championship later this month. On day one, Sean Nolan
    led the way with an outdoor PR of 14:41.29 as he placed 2nd. Nolan
    improved his national ranking with his time and hopes it is good
    enough to get him into the National Championship. Also setting a PR,
    and improving his national qualifying mark, was Greg Walker who threw
    the hammer 170-2. Also in the Hammer Throw, Chris Khan placed 4th
    with a throw of 180-8.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the High Jump, Craig Mielcarz tied for 4th with a first clear
    at 6-7. Teammate Brian Hoying also made 6-7, but settled for 6th
    position.
    
    
    
    
    
    On the track, Brian Anderson qualified for the finals of the 1500
    with a 3:55.80. The other runners were not so fortunate. Alan Raphael
    ran 1:58.24 in the 800 after a slow first quarter and had to call it
    quits after a very successful season. Yuval Mazor, suffering from a
    cold, could not get untracked in the 400 and missed the finals. Zach
    Traina ran well into the wind, but his 22.63 was not enough to
    advance.
    
    
    
    
    
    Day two field events began with Khan throwing the Discus. With two
    of his three efforts being fouls he was unable to get one off far
    enough to make the finals, missing it by one person. Freshman Nate
    Ball continued his fantastic season with a 15-3 1/2 clearance, good
    enough for 5th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    Ben Schmeckpeper showed he is still on track to make it to
    nationals in the 3000 Steeplechase by running an even split first
    mile in 4:57, and finished in 7th with a PR and freshman record of
    9:24.12. This also provisionally qualified Schmeckpeper for the NCAA
    Championship. 
    
    
    
    
    
    Anderson was next on the track as he attempted to place in the
    1500. He did not have the same passion as last week, letting the
    competition pull away from him after the 1200 mark. Anderson finished
    the final 300 in a dismal 48 seconds to fade to 9th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final event for the Engineers was the 1600 Relay. The foursome
    of Matt Lehman, Raphael, Mark Jeunnette and Mazor decided they wanted
    one last opportunity to qualify for nationals, despite Lehman's
    tender hamstring and Mazor's cold. Lehman led off with a fine 49.8
    leg despite pulling his hamstring after the first turn. Raphael ran a
    personal best 400 leg when he also brought the baton in in 49.8.
    Jeunnette got out slow but nevertheless closed well with a 50.5 to
    put MIT on course for a season best. Mazor pulled it together long
    enough to bring the around in a 50.0 to give Tech their season best
    of 3:20.22
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT will take those that are provisionally qualified
    for nationals to the ECAC meet to see if they can improve their marks
    in their last chance opportunity. The meet will be held on Thursday
    and Friday at Springfield College.

    **MIT GETS OUT OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP BLOCKS
    WELL WITH RECORD SETTING VICTORY IN NEWMAC
    CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
    
    April 27, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT set a meet record for number of points scored on Saturday when
    they hosted the 4th annual NEWMAC (New England Women's and Men's
    Athletic Conference) Outdoor Track and Field Championship, scoring
    293 points to runnerup Springfield's 165 points. The Coast Guard
    Academy followed with 111.5, Wheaton with 109, WPI with 52.5 and
    Babson trailed with 36 in their second season of track and field. The
    meet awarded 10 points for 1st, and 8-6-5-4-3-2-1 for 2nd through 8th
    respectively. Each school was permitted up to 4 entries per
    event.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT, a pre-meet favorite by over 60 points, capitalized on their
    depth in the field events and quality in every event. The three main
    events the Engineers were looking to dominate were the Pole Vault,
    Hammer Throw and the 110 High Hurdles. Unlike most years when Tech
    had a dominant force in the middle distance and distance events, the
    2002 version has quality in those areas but not so much depth and is
    more dependent on balance.
    
    
    
    
    
    As expected, the hammer throwers came through with 25 points of a
    possible 29 when they placed 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th. Of the four, only
    David Saylor threw a PR when he launched one 148-8 to secure 5th
    place behind the winning throw by Marios Michalakis. The vaulters did
    not fall far behind the example set by the hammer throwers when they
    followed Nate Ball's new freshman and meet record 15-5 1/2 vault with
    3rd, 5th, 6th place finishes for 23 points. Also setting season bests
    in the vault were Dan Opila with a 13-9 1/4 for 3rd and 13-3 1/4 for
    Nestor Hernandez, good for 5th. The hurdlers stepped up with four
    season and three personal bests. Leading the way, Rick Rajter cruised
    to a 15.18 victory as he begins to round into championship form.
    Peter Bluvas showed he is getting ready for next week's decathlon as
    he set one of many PR's with a 4th place 15.58. Craig Mielcarz
    delivered a PR of 15.52 in the trials but fell to 15.62 in the finals
    for 5th place. Junius Ho blasted a 15.76 in the trials and finished
    7th in the finals for a total of 21 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    The other jumps also went well for MIT. The quality of the High
    Jump in this conference is the best in the country with two jumpers
    over 7' and two more over 6-10. Dan Olson and Raheim Greenridge of
    Wheaton did their job of going 1-2 with leaps of 7-1 and 6-11
    respectively. Brian Hoying and Craig Mielcarz of MIT followed in 3rd
    and 4th. The Long Jump gave MIT 17 points when Mielcarz delivered a
    21-6 effort for 2nd place and Ho added his 2nd season best of the day
    with a 21-4 3/4 leap for 3rd. Tom Hoover, fighting injuries, was only
    able to produce a 21-0 performance for 6th. Austin Neudecker garnered
    2nd in the Triple Jump by leaping 43-9 1/4 behind the 49-7 1/4 effort
    by Wheaton's Greenridge. Ho again came through with a career best
    when he placed 6th with 41-4 1/4.
    
    
    
    
    
    If the jumps went well, the throws were exceptional. Even the
    traditionally low scoring Shot Put crew delivered 15 points when
    Bluvas launched a PR of 43-4 3/4 to get 2nd ahead of some struggling
    Springfield throwers who usually own the event. Phil Zakielarz snuck
    into 3rd with a PR of 43-3 1/4. Chris Khan broke out of his techincal
    slump in the Discus with a throw of 160-8 for 1st place. Greg Walker
    and Peter Bluvas aslo had PRs with throws of 135-3 and 132-10, good
    for 5th and 6th places. Dale Cotton showed his throw last week of
    180-11 in the Javelin was no fluke when he threw 176-9 for 3rd
    place.
    
    
    
    
    
    Injuries and illnesses prevented Tech from filling the events in
    the running arena, but what they had faired pretty well. Brian
    Anderson was one of only two double event winners in the meet.
    Anderson took control of both the 800 and 1500 in the latter stages,
    running 1:55.96 and 3:57.73 under the very windy conditions. In the
    800, Alan Raphael supported with a PR of 1:55.98 for 2nd. Sean Nolan
    helped out in the 1500 with a PR of 4:00.27, good enough for 4th.
    
    
    
    
    
    The distance events followed suit with Ben Schmeckpeper continuing
    to knock near 10 second increments off his time each week when he ran
    9:29.71 as he approached the freshman record of 9:25.68. Sean Nolan
    came back very well from his 1500 and delivered a runaway victory in
    the 5000 with a 14:55.82. Albert Liu supported the effort with a
    season best of 15:36.66 for 6th. Liyan Guo and Greg Fonder placed 2nd
    and 3rd in the 10K by running 34:19.13 and 35:20.20 respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    Zach Traina placed 2nd and 3rd in his sprint specialties with
    11.12 and 22.26 times in the 100 and 200 meter dashes. Marc
    Washington supported in both with a 5th in the 100 and a 4th in the
    200. The 200 brought surprise results with 17 points when Rick Rajter
    ran a 22.90 PR for his first effort this year and Yuval Mazor ran a
    PR of 23.02, good for 5th and 7th respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    Earlier, Matt Lehman and Yuval Mazor finished 3rd and 4th in the
    400 with times of 50.29 and 50.55 respectively. Gabe Sanchez offered
    support by finishing in 7th. The other 400 event, the intermediate
    hurdles, went very well as Mark Jeunnette ran 56.03 for 2nd and a
    season best. Russ Moriarty followed in 3rd and Bluvas placed 6th in
    his first effort of the year.
    
    
    
    
    
    The relays brought more success for the Engineers. The 400 Relay
    of Traina, Rajter, Mazor and Washington had two good handoffs en
    route to a 43.29 2nd place finish. Matt Lehman led off the 1600 Relay
    with a 49.5 leg to put MIT ahead for good. Jeunnette, Anderson and
    Mazor finished the job in 3:22.81 for the victory.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Engineers are ready, but whether or not they are ready to
    finish the unfinished task of beating Williams College for the New
    England Division III title, being held at Williams, remains to be
    seen. The meet will start with the Decathlon on Thursday and Friday
    and conclude with the remaining events on Satruday.

    **MIT CAPS OFF SPRING TRIP WITH 3 NCAA
    PROVISIONAL QUALIFYING MARKS**
    
    
    
    March 29-30, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    The MIT Men's Track and Field team ended a warm and sunny week in
    Palo Alto, California on the campus of Stanford University at the
    annual Stanford Invitational. This meet is considered the kickoff to
    the Outdoor Track seaon for NCAA Division I schools as well as open
    athletes competing after their collegiate careers. The overwhelming
    competition did not seem to bother the Engineers, indeed it seemed to
    inspire some remarkable performances given how hard the team worked
    during the week leading up to the meet.
    
    
    
    
    
    While the hard workouts and the week of 80 degree temperatures
    seemed to leave the representatives from Cambridge, Massachusetts
    tired, the competition seemed to bring out the best in them. Leading
    the way with a tie for 5th was Craig Mielcarz with a national
    qualifying jump of 6-8 in the high jump. Also qualifying
    provisionally for the NCAA Championship were Chris Khan in the Hammer
    with a throw of 168-11 and Sean Nolan in the 5000 with a time of
    14:47.22.
    
    
    
    
    
    Numerous personal bests and New England Division III qualifying
    performances were also achieved on the Stanford track and field.
    Craig Wildman ran a terrific race in the 3000 Steeplechase, running
    9:48.17 for both a PR and a qualifying mark. Craig Mielcarz also had
    a good long jump effort of 20-11 1/4. Victor Williamson leaped 43-4
    1/4 in the Triple Jump for a PR and was closely followed by Austin
    Neudecker with a 43-3 3/4 effort. Nate Ball started the outdoor
    season off well with a vault of 14-9. In the other running events,
    Mark Jeunnette seemed to run everything well. Mark began with an
    intermediate hurdle race in 58.02 and shortly afterwards won his
    section of the 800 with a 1:55.31 performance. The next day, Mark
    anchored the 1600 relay consisting of Yuval Mazor, Alan Raphael and
    Gabe Sanchez to an overall time of 3:24.63 with his 50.3 leg. Running
    the fastest MIT time since 2000, the 400 relay team of Zach Traina,
    Rick Rajter, Yuval Mazor and Marc Washington ran 43.63 despite two
    poor handoffs.
    
    
    
    
    
    Other good performaces were supplied by; Junius Ho, who jumped
    20-5 1/4 in the long jump and ran 15.86 in the 110 High Hurdles, Rick
    Rajter and Peter Bluvas, running 15.59 and 15.81 respectively in the
    110 HH, Brian Anderson running 4:00.66 in the 1500, Matt Lehman and
    Yuval Mazor running 50.42 and 50.80 respectively in the 400 and Zach
    Traina running 22.85 and 11.33 in the 200 and 100 respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next Saturday, the annual Engineers Cup will be hosted by WPI as
    MIT tries to avenge their loss to RPI last year, when numerous
    athletes were out with injuries and illnesses.

    **TECH TRACK FINISHES 4-0 FOR REGULAR
    SEASON**
    
    
    
    April 13, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    Craig Mielcarz, qualifying automatically for the NCAA Division III
    Championships with his 6-10 1/4 winning effort, led four other
    Engineers, who earned provisional qualifying marks in their
    respective events, en route to a convincing victory over Division II
    powerhouse UMass/Lowell and Division III rival, Bowdoin College at a
    meet hosted by MIT.
    
    
    
    
    
    Breaking in the new Mondo track and jumping surface, MIT scorched
    the new surface with several New England Division III qualifying
    times, throws and jumps. Finishing their regular season with a 4-0
    record, MIT turned a 5 point seed performance deficit into a 60 point
    victory, scoring 192 points to 132 for UMass/Lowell. Bowdoin followed
    with 81.
    
    
    
    
    
    Tech new they had a big edge in the jumping events over UML, but
    knew the advantage UML owned in the 100-400IH may be too much to
    overcome. The jumpers took care of their job by outscoring UML 59 1/2
    to 12 with Bowdoin scoring 20. Likewise, the throwers for MIT scored
    45 to 21 to 25 for UML and Bowdoin respectively. Mielcarz led four
    MIT long jumpers over 21' with his 22-04 1/4 PR, good for 2nd place.
    Also over 21' were Tom Hoover 21-11 3/4, Junius Ho 21-1 1/2 and
    Austin Neudecker 21-0 1/2 for 3rd, 4th and 5th places. In the High
    Jump, Mielcarz was followed by a 6-8 national qualifying effort from
    Brian Hoying to take 1st and 2nd. The Pole Vault brought another PR
    and freshman record from Nathan Ball at 15-3, which was also a
    provisional NCAA qualifying performance. Dan Kwon followed in 2nd
    place, jumping 13-6. Austin Neudecker followed his 6-2 effort in the
    High Jump with a final jump of 44-6 in the Triple Jump to place 2nd
    and lead a 2-5 sweep.
    
    
    
    
    
    Chris Khan just missed an automatic qualifying mark in the Hammer
    throw with a PR winning effort of 182-1. Marios Michalakis competed
    for the first time this year, throwing 170-3 for 2nd place and also
    qualifying provisionally for the NCAA championship. Greg Walker and
    David Saylor placed 4th and 5th, throwing PRs of 157-5 and 147-3
    respectively to lead the hammer throwers to earn the honor of the
    highest scoring event for MIT. Khan also won the Discus, but it was
    far below his best effort, as he threw 145-5. Khan was unable to
    produce his best effort in the Shot Put, bus Francisco Cruz stepped
    up to place 2nd with a throw of 43-4 1/4. Phil Zakielarz placed 3rd
    in his MIT debut with a 43-0 1/2 effort. In the Javelin, Dale Cotton
    came through with a PR of 161-10, good enough for 4th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    On the track, UML outscored the Engineers 99 to 87 1/2, but that
    was much closer than the 128-68 margin the seeds predicted. Things
    started well for MIT in the first event, the 3000 steeplechase. Ben
    Schmeckpeper, running his 2nd steeple ever, came from way behind to
    run an 11 second PR to win in 9:48.60. Craig Wildman supported the
    effort with a 10:04.30 3rd place performance. This 4 point swing was
    followed by a predictable 2nd place effort in the 400 Relay. However,
    the 43.07 performance was a pleasant surprise by the Engineers.
    
    
    
    
    
    The next event brought about a 6 point swing as Brian Anderson ran
    a season best of 3:56.61 and Sean Nolan ran a huge PR of 4:00.90 in
    the strong winds placed 2nd and 4th and UML was only able to place
    1st and 3rd, far below their seeds.
    
    
    
    
    
    The High Hurdles went very well for UML as they went 1-2 to MIT's
    3 through 6. This did not help Tech's cause as the swing was 8 points
    in UML's favor. Nevertheless, season bests were earned by Rick Rajter
    in 15.26 and Craig Mielcarz in 15.61.
    
    
    
    
    
    Yuval Mazor and Matt Lehman broke the 50 second barrier for the
    first time in the 400, placing 5th and 6th respectively with times of
    49.85 and 49.88. With UML scoring 15 compared to their predicted 21,
    the 8 point swing from the hurdles was erased.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the 100, MIT gained another 3 points over the seeds when Zach
    Traina took advantage of the tailwind to run a 10.91 to win by .08
    seconds and set a freshman record. Marc Washington followed in 6th
    with 11.26.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 800 went exactly as predicted, with Brian Anderson and Alan
    Raphael placing 1st and 2nd for MIT in times of 1:58.02 and 1:59.15
    respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    Another 5 point swing occurred in the 400IH where UML was
    scheduled to score 19 points to 3 for MIT. Mark Jeunnette and Russ
    Moriarty ran season bests of 56.50 and 56.89 to place 4th and 5th
    respectively and earn 5 points while UML placed 1-2-3 for 16.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 200 was the biggest surprise of the day for Tech. Traina came
    through again, this time with a second place of 22.02 to miss first
    by .03 seconds, and get his second freshman record of the day. UML
    was seeded to outscore MIT 18 to 0, but Traina's performance,
    combined with a 22.61 from Marc Washington for 6th turned the event's
    score to 6 for MIT and 13 for MIT.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 5000 was another event where UML was seeded to outscore MIT.
    Tech rarely gets outscored in a distance event, but this was the
    opponent that beat them in a cross country meet in the fall. Sean
    Nolan and Ben Schmeckpeper came back from their first events to make
    sure things went MIT's way, which they did with Tech scoring 12 to
    UML's 7. Nolan won the event in 15:06.52 by running behind and
    outkicking his opponent in the final 400.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final event on the track, the 1600 relay, brought a great
    finish to a great meet. Lehman led off with a fine 50.0 to put MIT in
    the lead for good. Jeunnette brought the baton in with a 50.7 on this
    very windy day. Anderson, running his 3rd event of the day, showed he
    gets better as the day goes on, running a PR of 50.5 to extend the
    lead. Mazor did his job, bringing the baton to victory with a 49.9
    leg to finish in 3:21.32, a truly great time under the conditions,
    particularly in a tri-meet.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the Engineers travel to Northeastern University in
    Dedham to compete in the Husky Invitational. This is a non-scoring
    meet where MIT hopes to improve on many individual performances.
