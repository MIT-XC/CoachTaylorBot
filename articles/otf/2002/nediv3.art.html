IN NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>MAY 2-4, 2002</P>

<P>Despite three individual victories and 10 personal bests, MIT
Men's Track and Field team was not match for a very strong team from
Williams College. MIT's 122 points ranks as the highest total in
history for a 2nd place finish, but that was little consolation for
the Engineers who were hoping to perform a little better and for
Williams performers to not compete at their best level--neither
happened as Williams scored 169.5 points for the title.</P>

<P>Peter Bluvas got things rolling for Tech with a 2 day Decathlon
victory in very unfriendly conditions that has 50 mph winds, a little
rain and even a snow flurry. The highlight of the event was a 22
vault effort to jump 12-7 1/4 for a new PR in the vault. Bluvas
finished with 5732 points for a career best. Ossinger from Williams
placed 5th to make the score 10-4 after 1 event.</P>

<P>MIT has 31 athletes competing in the meet, a new record, but most
were seeded outside the top 4. Nevertheless, Tech had finalists in
every event with trials (100, 110HH, 200, 400, 400IH). In the first
final of the day, the 10K, MIT was seeded 8th with Albert Liu, but
failed to score. Williams placed 2nd and 7th to garner 10 more
points.</P>

<P>The Long and Hammer were the next finals to take place. Craig
Mielcarz and Tom Hoover placed 5th and 6th in the Long Jump despite
the head wind. While Williams scored 0 points in the LJ, that was not
the case in the Hammer. Richard Chau of Williams had a big PR to
place 2nd, just ahead of Chris Khan, 182-10 to 182. Marios Michalakis
placed 6th for MIT and Greg Walker had a PR of 165-1 for a new
PR.</P>

<P>Next in the field events were the Triple Jump, High Jump and Pole
Vault. Austin Neudecker was leading the triple after the trials with
his 44-4 jump into the headwind. However, the last two rounds brought
out some great performances, most notably a 2nd place effort of 44-9
by Dwight Ho-Sang of Williams, which combined with a 5th place by his
teammate put MIT behind for good.</P>

<P>The High Jump, going on at the same time, had very good results
for MIT. Mielcarz placed 2nd with 6-9 3/4 and was supported by a 4th
place from Brian Hoying and a 7th from Rick Rajter. Williams finished
below their seed with only a tie for 8th.</P>

<P>Nathan Ball continued his assault on the freshman pole vault
record, moving into 2nd place all time on the MIT vaulting list with
his 15-7 1/4 winning vault - again into a wind. Ball was not
supported by his vaulting mates on this particular day, although
Bluvas came back to set another best of 12-11. Williams had a vaulter
place 2nd who was favored to win, but Tech was favored to score 12,
so the net result was the same.</P>

<P>In the Discus, the anticipated battle between last year's winner,
Chris Khan from MIT and the nation's leading Division III thrower,
Dan Austin of Williams never materialized as Khan had difficulty
staying in and was only able to place 4th with a throw of 152-1, 8
inches out of 2nd.</P>

<P>The other field events were not scoring ones for MIT, but Williams
managed 29 points in the Shot Put as they placed 1-4 to close out the
meet.</P>

<P>The first final on the track after all the trials was the 400
Relay. MIT's quartet of Zach Traina, Rajter, Yuval Mazor and Marc
Washington ran a PR of 42.75 to place as the fastest time for MIT
since 1990. The PR gave them 4th place, just behind Williams.</P>

<P>The next event, the 3000SC saw two MIT entrants not attack the
start enough to get into the race. Ben Schmeckpeper, a freshman who
was seeded 5th, moved up in the lst half of the race to place 5th in
9:34.74, but again, Williams College placed higher than they were
seeded when Karl Remsen won in 9:08.99 and Zach Blume finished in
8th.</P>

<P>Brian Anderson continued to run very well as he took a fast pace
and made it faster when after trailing in 2:05, he ran a 60 second
400 to come through the 1200 in 3:05. Anderson never looked back as
he ran to a new PR of 3:53.04 despite the windy conditions. The
bigger surprise was turned in by Sean Nolan. Nolan was seeded 5th
with a best of 4:00.27. Moving hard in the last 150, Nolan challenged
last year's national champion, Mark Miller of Keene State before
finishing in 3rd with a 3:55.64 to provisionally qualify for
nationals. Williams was seeded to score 0, but managed 4th with a
gutsy 3:56 from Matt Winkler out of the slow section.</P>

<P>Rick Rajter was not able to put all his ailments behind him, but
put enough on hold to finish in 4th with a 15.21 into the wind.
Rajter, hoping at the beginning of the season to qualify for
nationals in this event, will give his back a much neede rest to see
if the swelling around his spine can go down.</P>

<P>Yuval Mazor ran a PR of 49.67 in the trials, joining Matt Lehman
in the finals of the 400. Mazor placed 4th in 49.87 and Lehman 6th in
49.95. The 8 points was 2 below what was expected. Williams also lost
2 from their predicted seeds as thier 1st seed finished 2nd.</P>

<P>Zach Traina could not match his wind aided 10.91, but he did
manage to place 5th after being seeded 4th. Williams, seeded to score
13 in one of their strongest events, managed 16 as they finished 1st
and 3rd. The 200 was much the same as Traina placed 6th and Williams
scored 13.</P>

<P>The 800 was another bright moment for Tech. Alan Raphael, on a
mission all season, came out of nowhere to place 2nd in a PR of
1:54.15. Anderson tried to come back, and managed to go with the
leaders through the 54 first quarter, but was not able to recover
enough in the 40 minutes between races to do better than 1:58.
Williams, seeded to score 26 points, finally had a bad event as they
only scored 11.</P>

<P>The 400IH saw two MIT runners make the finals, but 7th and 8th was
all that was managed, although that was higher than they were seeded
to score. Russ Moriarty ran a PR of 55.97 in the trials, but placed
behind teammate Mark Jeunnette in the finals.</P>

<P>Williams won the 1600 relay in 3:16.85, a fine time in the wind.
MIT could not manage to score with their 3:27.02 as all their entries
had already spent themselves in previous races.</P>

<P>Next week, Tech goes to Northeastern University for the All New
England meet on Friday and Saturday. Last year, MIT placed 9th
against their foes from other divisions, but hope to place higher
this year.</P>
