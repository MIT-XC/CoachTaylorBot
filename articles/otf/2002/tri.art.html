SEASON</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>April 13, 2002</P>

<P>Craig Mielcarz, qualifying automatically for the NCAA Division III
Championships with his 6-10 1/4 winning effort, led four other
Engineers, who earned provisional qualifying marks in their
respective events, en route to a convincing victory over Division II
powerhouse UMass/Lowell and Division III rival, Bowdoin College at a
meet hosted by MIT.</P>

<P>Breaking in the new Mondo track and jumping surface, MIT scorched
the new surface with several New England Division III qualifying
times, throws and jumps. Finishing their regular season with a 4-0
record, MIT turned a 5 point seed performance deficit into a 60 point
victory, scoring 192 points to 132 for UMass/Lowell. Bowdoin followed
with 81.</P>

<P>Tech new they had a big edge in the jumping events over UML, but
knew the advantage UML owned in the 100-400IH may be too much to
overcome. The jumpers took care of their job by outscoring UML 59 1/2
to 12 with Bowdoin scoring 20. Likewise, the throwers for MIT scored
45 to 21 to 25 for UML and Bowdoin respectively. Mielcarz led four
MIT long jumpers over 21' with his 22-04 1/4 PR, good for 2nd place.
Also over 21' were Tom Hoover 21-11 3/4, Junius Ho 21-1 1/2 and
Austin Neudecker 21-0 1/2 for 3rd, 4th and 5th places. In the High
Jump, Mielcarz was followed by a 6-8 national qualifying effort from
Brian Hoying to take 1st and 2nd. The Pole Vault brought another PR
and freshman record from Nathan Ball at 15-3, which was also a
provisional NCAA qualifying performance. Dan Kwon followed in 2nd
place, jumping 13-6. Austin Neudecker followed his 6-2 effort in the
High Jump with a final jump of 44-6 in the Triple Jump to place 2nd
and lead a 2-5 sweep.</P>

<P>Chris Khan just missed an automatic qualifying mark in the Hammer
throw with a PR winning effort of 182-1. Marios Michalakis competed
for the first time this year, throwing 170-3 for 2nd place and also
qualifying provisionally for the NCAA championship. Greg Walker and
David Saylor placed 4th and 5th, throwing PRs of 157-5 and 147-3
respectively to lead the hammer throwers to earn the honor of the
highest scoring event for MIT. Khan also won the Discus, but it was
far below his best effort, as he threw 145-5. Khan was unable to
produce his best effort in the Shot Put, bus Francisco Cruz stepped
up to place 2nd with a throw of 43-4 1/4. Phil Zakielarz placed 3rd
in his MIT debut with a 43-0 1/2 effort. In the Javelin, Dale Cotton
came through with a PR of 161-10, good enough for 4th place.</P>

<P>On the track, UML outscored the Engineers 99 to 87 1/2, but that
was much closer than the 128-68 margin the seeds predicted. Things
started well for MIT in the first event, the 3000 steeplechase. Ben
Schmeckpeper, running his 2nd steeple ever, came from way behind to
run an 11 second PR to win in 9:48.60. Craig Wildman supported the
effort with a 10:04.30 3rd place performance. This 4 point swing was
followed by a predictable 2nd place effort in the 400 Relay. However,
the 43.07 performance was a pleasant surprise by the Engineers.</P>

<P>The next event brought about a 6 point swing as Brian Anderson ran
a season best of 3:56.61 and Sean Nolan ran a huge PR of 4:00.90 in
the strong winds placed 2nd and 4th and UML was only able to place
1st and 3rd, far below their seeds.</P>

<P>The High Hurdles went very well for UML as they went 1-2 to MIT's
3 through 6. This did not help Tech's cause as the swing was 8 points
in UML's favor. Nevertheless, season bests were earned by Rick Rajter
in 15.26 and Craig Mielcarz in 15.61.</P>

<P>Yuval Mazor and Matt Lehman broke the 50 second barrier for the
first time in the 400, placing 5th and 6th respectively with times of
49.85 and 49.88. With UML scoring 15 compared to their predicted 21,
the 8 point swing from the hurdles was erased.</P>

<P>In the 100, MIT gained another 3 points over the seeds when Zach
Traina took advantage of the tailwind to run a 10.91 to win by .08
seconds and set a freshman record. Marc Washington followed in 6th
with 11.26.</P>

<P>The 800 went exactly as predicted, with Brian Anderson and Alan
Raphael placing 1st and 2nd for MIT in times of 1:58.02 and 1:59.15
respectively.</P>

<P>Another 5 point swing occurred in the 400IH where UML was
scheduled to score 19 points to 3 for MIT. Mark Jeunnette and Russ
Moriarty ran season bests of 56.50 and 56.89 to place 4th and 5th
respectively and earn 5 points while UML placed 1-2-3 for 16.</P>

<P>The 200 was the biggest surprise of the day for Tech. Traina came
through again, this time with a second place of 22.02 to miss first
by .03 seconds, and get his second freshman record of the day. UML
was seeded to outscore MIT 18 to 0, but Traina's performance,
combined with a 22.61 from Marc Washington for 6th turned the event's
score to 6 for MIT and 13 for MIT.</P>

<P>The 5000 was another event where UML was seeded to outscore MIT.
Tech rarely gets outscored in a distance event, but this was the
opponent that beat them in a cross country meet in the fall. Sean
Nolan and Ben Schmeckpeper came back from their first events to make
sure things went MIT's way, which they did with Tech scoring 12 to
UML's 7. Nolan won the event in 15:06.52 by running behind and
outkicking his opponent in the final 400.</P>

<P>The final event on the track, the 1600 relay, brought a great
finish to a great meet. Lehman led off with a fine 50.0 to put MIT in
the lead for good. Jeunnette brought the baton in with a 50.7 on this
very windy day. Anderson, running his 3rd event of the day, showed he
gets better as the day goes on, running a PR of 50.5 to extend the
lead. Mazor did his job, bringing the baton to victory with a 49.9
leg to finish in 3:21.32, a truly great time under the conditions,
particularly in a tri-meet.</P>

<P>Next week, the Engineers travel to Northeastern University in
Dedham to compete in the Husky Invitational. This is a non-scoring
meet where MIT hopes to improve on many individual performances.</P>
