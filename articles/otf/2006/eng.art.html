    ENGINEER'S CUP</span></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Orji and Wozniak Lead the Way, Scoring 45 3/4 Points</strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 8, 2006</p>
  <p align="left"><a href="eng.res.html">The Engineer's Cup</a>, a meet that appeared to be very close on
    paper, did not turn out that way as MIT dealt with the cold temperatures
    and damp conditions and ran away with the meet, scoring 177.5 points to RPI's
    129 and host WPI's 91.5.&nbsp; Leading
    the way were seniors Thad Wozniak and Uzoma Orji.&nbsp; Orji did it in his
    usual fashion, by winning his three events, the hammer, discus and shot put.&nbsp; Wozniak,
    preparing himself for the decathlon in a month, participated in eight events
    and scored in seven of them, accumulating 24.75 points.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT only won seven of the 19 events, but nevertheless dominated
    the scoring by winning three of more of the scoring spots in six of those
    events.&nbsp; There were six scoring places in each non-relay event with
    first place earning seven points and second through sixth earning five, four,
    three, two and one point respectively.&nbsp; The first event, the long jump
    was one of those events.&nbsp; MIT got off on the right foot so to speak
    by placing 1-2-3-6 in the event and being led by Thad Wozniak's winning personal
    best of 20-09 1/4.&nbsp; Right after the long jump, the same group started
    the triple jump.&nbsp;When it was all said and done MIT had scored 20 of
    the 22 points in the event by placing 1-2-3-4-6, this time being led by Anthony
  Teixeira.</p>
  <p align="left">On the track, MIT owned the middle distance events.&nbsp; It
    began with the 3000SC where Tech, led by Chris Bruce's comfortable 10:12.12,
    placed 1-3-5 with Rocco Repetski running a personal best of 10:39.46 and
    Ryan King debuting in 11:03.25.&nbsp; Shortly after that, the milers took
    to the track and despite a very slow first 800 (2:18), they placed 2-3-4-5
    with Fivos Constantinou leading the effort in 4:11.29.&nbsp; In the 800,
    Yermie Cohen took the pace out hard after getting tripped early, leading
    a group of seven MIT runners.&nbsp; The
    winner of the 1500 from WPI challenged towards the end of the first quarter
    but was soon overwhelmed by Tech runners.&nbsp; Jake Ruzevick negative split
    the race, winning in 2:01.48.&nbsp; MIT scored 20 of the 22 points by claiming
    1-2-3-4-6 places.</p>
  <p align="left">The other event in which MIT claimed three of the six places
    was the 110HH.&nbsp; Omari Stephens faltered a bit and lost the battle for
    first by thousandths of a second.&nbsp; Wozniak had a personal best
    for fourth and Teixeira placed fifth.  </p>
  <p align="left">MIT had three new qualifiers for the New England Division III
    Championships.&nbsp; Wozniak qualified with his mark in the long jump.&nbsp; James
    Oleinik added the discus to his shot put qualifying mark with a throw of
    130-4.&nbsp; Spencer Dudley ran a huge personal best in running 15:39.37
    to qualify in the 5000 meter run.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week MIT hopes to have the services of two of their injured
    sprinters as well as the return of Alex Rothberg in the 400 as they travel
    to Bates College to face the Bobcats along with Colby College and the University
    of Southern Maine.</p>
