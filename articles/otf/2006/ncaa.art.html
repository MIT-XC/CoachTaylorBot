  <p><strong><span class="style1">ORJI REPRESENTS MIT WELL AT
    NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP</span></strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">May 25-27, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji entered his final <a href="ncaa.res.html">NCAA Division
      III Championship</a>    as the lone MIT entrant.&nbsp; The meet, hosted by Benedictine University
    in Lisle, Il, just outside of Chicago, Orji's birthplace.&nbsp; He came here
    with one goal in mind, two national titles; one in the hammer throw and one
    in the shot put.&nbsp; To date Orji had earned 10 All America honors; two
    indoor shot put titles, one indoor weight throw title and national record,
    two additional indoor shot All America honors and two weight throw All America
    honors, two outdoor shot put All America honors and one hammer throw.</p>
  <p align="left">His first event was the hammer throw on the second day of competition.&nbsp;Seeded
    second, Orji had to wait until the second flight to get in the circle and
    take care of business.&nbsp; The first flight performed poorly with no throwers
    performing near the mark that got them there and only one throwing over 180'.&nbsp; The
    second flight was a little better with three over 180'.&nbsp; Orji began
    with a sector foul and finished with a 185' effort to place him in second
    overall going into the finals.&nbsp; Ross Kapp from Wisconsin Whitewater
    threw a personal best of 198-11on his third throw to take the lead.&nbsp; Perhaps
    the biggest surprise was that Kevin Becker, the number one seed and defending
    national champion, did not throw far enough to make the finals. </p>
  <p align="left">In the finals, Orji fouled his first effort but maintained
    his second place position.&nbsp; In the second round of finals Busalacchi,
    also of Wisconsin Whitewater, moved into second and Foster of Colby College
    moved into third before Orji threw.&nbsp; Orji improved to 189-3 to move
    back into third.&nbsp; In the final round no one behind Orji threatened his
    position.&nbsp; Orji let it all go and had his second best throw ever at
    198-4 to move back into second and miss first place by a mere seven inches.</p>
  <p align="left">Having missed out on his first goal, Orji was determined to
    open up with a big throw in the shot put.&nbsp; As the first thrower  in
    the competition, the second seeded Orji opened up with a throw of 58-9 1/2,
    his best throw of the season and the best in the country for division III
    by two centimeters.&nbsp; No one was close in the first round, but in the
    second round, Nate Meckes of Calvin College, the number one seed, threw 57-9
    1/2 to take over second position.&nbsp; Orji threw 58-8 on his second throw
    to show he was definitely here to compete.&nbsp; On his third throw he fouled.&nbsp; There
    were no other throwers over 54-7 in the first flight.</p>
  <p align="left">In the second flight, Brandon Houle from Wisconsin Oshkosh
    threw a season best as the first thrower at 57-7.&nbsp; In the third round,
    Dwayne Lockridge of Anderson College threw a three foot personal best for
    a mark of 57-3.&nbsp; Going into the finals there were four throwers over
    57 feet.</p>
  <p align="left">Orji was throwing last in the final by virtue of his best throw
    in the trials.&nbsp; His opening mark in the finals was a heave of 58-0 1/2
    as he continued to be a little off balance.&nbsp; None of the top four throwers
    improved in the first round of the finals, but in the second round Orji hit
    his position and everyone knew it was going to be big as it left his hand.&nbsp; The
    shot landed at 60-2 1/2 to ice the competition and set a new personal best
    and MIT record.&nbsp; The elusive 60' mark was finally broken.&nbsp; The
    most amazing part of the story is that up until this year Orji had been a
    glider, only picking up the spin in November.&nbsp; For his efforts, Orji
    won the NCAA Division III Outdoor Field Athlete of the Meet for the first
    time and his fourth overall (three indoor awards) </p>
  <p align="left">Orji finishes his career as arguably the best MIT student/athlete
    ever, winning four NCAA titles and earning 12 All America honors.&nbsp; The
    student part of this equation is not taken lightly either as he finishes
    his degree in Electrical Engineering with a 4.9 GPA.</p>
