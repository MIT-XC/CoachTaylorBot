    TIMES IN NEICAAA CHAMPIONSHIP</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 12-13, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">On a windy and rainy weekend athletes from New England colleges
    of all divisions braved the elements to compete in the NEICAAA Championship
    hosted by MIT.&nbsp; Over 40 teams for both men and women and 700 athletes  brought
    their best to the championship won by UConn on the women's side with 229
    1/4 points and the University of Rhode Island on the men's side with 124
    1/2 points.</p>
  <p align="left">While the weather was predicted to be the worst for both Friday
    and Saturday, Friday did not bring the torrents of rain.&nbsp; It was windy
    and overcast with temperatures hovering in the mid 50's.&nbsp; Saturday however
    was as miserable as it can get in mid May.&nbsp; Temperatures were in the
    50's and wind was not quite as strong as on Friday but the rain was relentless.&nbsp; It
    rained so much the drainage system was overflowing near the end of the meet
    and all of the electrical boxes being used to run the finish line system
    were underwater.</p>
  <p align="left">In spite of the uncooperative weather, many MIT athletes produced
    personal bests.&nbsp; David Blau ran his way to a fifth place in the 100
    with a 10.89 time and a seventh in the 200 with a 21.96 personal best.&nbsp; The
    races were originally set up as trials on Friday and finals on Saturday.&nbsp; With
    the clear evidence of the rains coming in on Saturday the coaches decided
    to move all events from the 400IH and 400 down to the 100 to sections on
    time to be competed on Friday.&nbsp; Blau made the most of his opportunity
    scoring all but one of MIT's points.</p>
  <p align="left">With Uzoma Orji competing at the IC4A Championship at Princeton
    University, freshman James Oleinik took up the slack and threw a personal
    best of 48-9 in the shot put to place eighth.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">On the women's side, MIT placed 15th overall with 17 points.&nbsp; Leading
    the way was Chi-Fong Wang in the javelin with a throw of 128-3 into the strong
    winds to place 4th.&nbsp; Also placing fourth was the 4x800 team of Adrienne
    Bolger, Andrea Bradshaw, Hana Adaniya and Rachel Niehuus.&nbsp; The quartet
    ran 9:39.4 to finish as the top division III team.&nbsp; Freshman Emily Hwang
    finished sixth in the pole vault with a leap of 10-11 3/4.&nbsp; Leanne Veldhuis
    ran a personal best in the 400IH to place seventh in 64.86.&nbsp; Another
    personal best was established by Aline Thomas, who threw 156-1 in the hammer
    to finish eighth.&nbsp; The final personal best was established by Betsy
    Eames.&nbsp; Running her third 10K in as many weeks, she dropped her time
    by over 30 seconds to 38:55.33 to also place eighth.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, those with a chance to qualify for the NCAA Championship
    will be traveling to Springfield College to compete in the ECAC Championship
    on Thursday and Friday, May 18-19.</p>
