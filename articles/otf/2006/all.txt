        ECAC Championship**
    
    
      
    
    May 18-19, 2006
    
    
      
    
    In the midst of final projects being due and preparing for
        exams, a small contingent of MIT track and field athletes made the trek west
        to Springfield College with the hopes of improving on performances in order
        to earn a ticket to the NCAA Division III Championships next week.
    
    
      
    
    Uzoma Orji, already automatically qualified in both the hammer
        and shot put for the NCAA Championship, was hoping to fix some technical
        issues that appeared in the past week.  Coincidentally, these technical
        problems started showing up when the lack of sleep due to the final project
        deadlines began to catch up with him.  Orji managed to have some very
        good warmups and a couple of near misses in the competition to give him the
        confidence that it is right there.  Orji won both the hammer and shot
        with marks of 184-3 and 55-8 1/4   respectively.
    
    
      
    
    David Blau, perhaps the most improved sprinter in MIT history,
        had the unfortunate situation of having to race into a strong headwind in
        both the 100 and 200.  Few tracks have the starting and finish lines
        arranged to be able to switch directions to accommodate the wind and unfortunately,
        Springfield is not one of them.  Blau had perhaps his best 100 ever
        but was only clocked in 11.13.  In the 200 Blau made up the stagger
        immediately but was unable to close the race out, finishing in 22.60, again
        into the wind.
    
    
      
    
    Thad Wozniak went to the runway for the final time as an MIT
        athlete in the long jump.  Not quite able to get his hips up at takeoff,
        Wozniak had to settle for eighth place, but at 21-4 1/4, a lesser mark than
        he was expecting. 
    
    
      
    
    Orji will make the trip to Benedictine University in Lisle,
        Illinois by himself next week where he will try to add to his three national
        titles and 10 all america honors.

    **MIT PERFORMS WELL IN WINNING
        ENGINEER'S CUP**
    
    
      
    
    **Orji and Wozniak Lead the Way, Scoring 45 3/4 Points**
    
    
      
    
    April 8, 2006
    
    
      
    
    The Engineer's Cup, a meet that appeared to be very close on
        paper, did not turn out that way as MIT dealt with the cold temperatures
        and damp conditions and ran away with the meet, scoring 177.5 points to RPI's
        129 and host WPI's 91.5.  Leading
        the way were seniors Thad Wozniak and Uzoma Orji.  Orji did it in his
        usual fashion, by winning his three events, the hammer, discus and shot put.  Wozniak,
        preparing himself for the decathlon in a month, participated in eight events
        and scored in seven of them, accumulating 24.75 points.
    
    
      
    
    MIT only won seven of the 19 events, but nevertheless dominated
        the scoring by winning three of more of the scoring spots in six of those
        events.  There were six scoring places in each non-relay event with
        first place earning seven points and second through sixth earning five, four,
        three, two and one point respectively.  The first event, the long jump
        was one of those events.  MIT got off on the right foot so to speak
        by placing 1-2-3-6 in the event and being led by Thad Wozniak's winning personal
        best of 20-09 1/4.  Right after the long jump, the same group started
        the triple jump. When it was all said and done MIT had scored 20 of
        the 22 points in the event by placing 1-2-3-4-6, this time being led by Anthony
      Teixeira.
    
    
      
    
    On the track, MIT owned the middle distance events.  It
        began with the 3000SC where Tech, led by Chris Bruce's comfortable 10:12.12,
        placed 1-3-5 with Rocco Repetski running a personal best of 10:39.46 and
        Ryan King debuting in 11:03.25.  Shortly after that, the milers took
        to the track and despite a very slow first 800 (2:18), they placed 2-3-4-5
        with Fivos Constantinou leading the effort in 4:11.29.  In the 800,
        Yermie Cohen took the pace out hard after getting tripped early, leading
        a group of seven MIT runners.  The
        winner of the 1500 from WPI challenged towards the end of the first quarter
        but was soon overwhelmed by Tech runners.  Jake Ruzevick negative split
        the race, winning in 2:01.48.  MIT scored 20 of the 22 points by claiming
        1-2-3-4-6 places.
    
    
      
    
    The other event in which MIT claimed three of the six places
        was the 110HH.  Omari Stephens faltered a bit and lost the battle for
        first by thousandths of a second.  Wozniak had a personal best
        for fourth and Teixeira placed fifth.  
    
    
      
    
    MIT had three new qualifiers for the New England Division III
        Championships.  Wozniak qualified with his mark in the long jump.  James
        Oleinik added the discus to his shot put qualifying mark with a throw of
        130-4.  Spencer Dudley ran a huge personal best in running 15:39.37
        to qualify in the 5000 meter run.
    
    
      
    
    Next week MIT hopes to have the services of two of their injured
        sprinters as well as the return of Alex Rothberg in the 400 as they travel
        to Bates College to face the Bobcats along with Colby College and the University
        of Southern Maine.

    Uzoma has a rough day but finishes
    5th in the hammer with 188' 10" at the IC4A Championships
    
    
    
    
    May 13-14, 2006  
    
    
    
    
    While other MIT athletes were competing at the NEIAAA Championships Uzoma
      Orji traveled to Princeton for the IC4A Championships to face the top competition
      in the East. While the rest of the MIT athletes were getting soaked with torrential
      downpours in Boston there was nothing but sun in Princeton on Saturday for
      the hammer throw. Uzoma came into the meet seeded third at 205' 9". The strongest throwers in the field were from Manhattan. They took first through fourth last year, all over 200'.  
    
    
    
    
    After the first heat it was evident that one of the Manhattan throwers was
      not going to make finals. Taking his place on top however was a thrower from
      Bucknell who led his flight with 200' 2". The second flight featured last year's champion Zoran Loncar who did not disappoint with a 203' 3" to win his flight. Going into the third flight the competition was wide open with third place being a relatively low 190'. Uzoma looked to be a little tentative on his first throw and didn't have the positions to get a fair throw. He then watched Paul Peulich from Manhattan throw 206' 6" to take the lead. On Uzoma's second throw he was able to get a mark with 188' 10" to secure fifth place before finals. On the third round he was not able to improve and Peulich threw 209' 10" to increase his lead.  
    
    
    
    
    Going into finals Uzoma knew that he had a solid chance of taking at least
      second place. After throwing around 200' twice in warmups he seemed to be ready.
      However the smooth acceleration that he displayed at Springfield last week
      just wasn't there and his distances suffered. Unable to improve his distance
      he finished in fifth place behind Freeman from Manhattan with 198' 3", Frake from Bucknell with 200' 2", Loncar from Manhattan with 208' 1", and Peulich from Manhattan with 209' 10".  
    
    
    
    
    Sunday morning the men's shot put was set to start with Uzoma seeded third
      behind Milan Jotanovic from Manhattan and Derek Anderson from Northeastern.
      Uzoma didn't get the feel of the circle during warmups and had to abort his
      first throw at the front of the circle. Lasher from Sacred Heart opened with
      a 55' 2" throw just after Uzoma. Then Anderson opened up with a 58' 9.5" toss to take the early lead. Uzoma bettered his mark with his second throw of 53' 8.5", but still didn't quite have the acceleration in the middle of the circle. With his third throw being under 52' he was looking forward to finals to correct his technique. In the second flight only Jotanovic was able to better Uzoma's mark when he took the lead with 60' 10", putting Uzoma in fourth place heading into finals.  
    
    
    
    
    With a few throwers breathing down his back Uzoma was able to improve his
      mark on his final throw of 53' 10.5" but still didn't have the active right leg acceleration that we had seen in practice during the week. He finished fourth just behind Lasher from Sacred Heart with 55' 2", Anderson from Northeastern with 61' 6.25", and Jotanovic with 62' 5.75". 
    
    
    
    
    Next week, Uzoma will join some of his teammates at Springfield College for
      the ECAC Championship where he will try to get back in the groove before heading
      to the NCAA Division III Championship on May 23.

    **ORJI REPRESENTS MIT WELL AT
        NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
     
    
    
      
    
    May 25-27, 2006
    
    
      
    
    Uzoma Orji entered his final NCAA Division
          III Championship    as the lone MIT entrant.  The meet, hosted by Benedictine University
        in Lisle, Il, just outside of Chicago, Orji's birthplace.  He came here
        with one goal in mind, two national titles; one in the hammer throw and one
        in the shot put.  To date Orji had earned 10 All America honors; two
        indoor shot put titles, one indoor weight throw title and national record,
        two additional indoor shot All America honors and two weight throw All America
        honors, two outdoor shot put All America honors and one hammer throw.
    
    
      
    
    His first event was the hammer throw on the second day of competition. Seeded
        second, Orji had to wait until the second flight to get in the circle and
        take care of business.  The first flight performed poorly with no throwers
        performing near the mark that got them there and only one throwing over 180'.  The
        second flight was a little better with three over 180'.  Orji began
        with a sector foul and finished with a 185' effort to place him in second
        overall going into the finals.  Ross Kapp from Wisconsin Whitewater
        threw a personal best of 198-11on his third throw to take the lead.  Perhaps
        the biggest surprise was that Kevin Becker, the number one seed and defending
        national champion, did not throw far enough to make the finals. 
    
    
      
    
    In the finals, Orji fouled his first effort but maintained
        his second place position.  In the second round of finals Busalacchi,
        also of Wisconsin Whitewater, moved into second and Foster of Colby College
        moved into third before Orji threw.  Orji improved to 189-3 to move
        back into third.  In the final round no one behind Orji threatened his
        position.  Orji let it all go and had his second best throw ever at
        198-4 to move back into second and miss first place by a mere seven inches.
    
    
      
    
    Having missed out on his first goal, Orji was determined to
        open up with a big throw in the shot put.  As the first thrower  in
        the competition, the second seeded Orji opened up with a throw of 58-9 1/2,
        his best throw of the season and the best in the country for division III
        by two centimeters.  No one was close in the first round, but in the
        second round, Nate Meckes of Calvin College, the number one seed, threw 57-9
        1/2 to take over second position.  Orji threw 58-8 on his second throw
        to show he was definitely here to compete.  On his third throw he fouled.  There
        were no other throwers over 54-7 in the first flight.
    
    
      
    
    In the second flight, Brandon Houle from Wisconsin Oshkosh
        threw a season best as the first thrower at 57-7.  In the third round,
        Dwayne Lockridge of Anderson College threw a three foot personal best for
        a mark of 57-3.  Going into the finals there were four throwers over
        57 feet.
    
    
      
    
    Orji was throwing last in the final by virtue of his best throw
        in the trials.  His opening mark in the finals was a heave of 58-0 1/2
        as he continued to be a little off balance.  None of the top four throwers
        improved in the first round of the finals, but in the second round Orji hit
        his position and everyone knew it was going to be big as it left his hand.  The
        shot landed at 60-2 1/2 to ice the competition and set a new personal best
        and MIT record.  The elusive 60' mark was finally broken.  The
        most amazing part of the story is that up until this year Orji had been a
        glider, only picking up the spin in November.  For his efforts, Orji
        won the NCAA Division III Outdoor Field Athlete of the Meet for the first
        time and his fourth overall (three indoor awards) 
    
    
      
    
    Orji finishes his career as arguably the best MIT student/athlete
        ever, winning four NCAA titles and earning 12 All America honors.  The
        student part of this equation is not taken lightly either as he finishes
        his degree in Electrical Engineering with a 4.9 GPA.

    MIT was seeded fourth going into the New
          England Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championship hosted by Springfield College, behind
        Williams College, Bates College and Tufts University.   Led by two meet
        records by Uzoma Orji and the resulting 24 points in his three events, MIT
        rallied past Bates but got caught by Tufts in a series of mishaps that led
        to falling behind by 1/2 point.
    
    
      
    
    For the first time, the men's and women's championships were
        run at the same site, meaning that some of the events other than the multi-events
        would be held on Friday.  The first event, the long jump,  had
        MIT seeded eighth and tenth.  After two very average jumps, Thad Wozniak,
        on the brink of elimination, put together a personal best jump of 22-4 1/4
        to finish fifth.  Chris
        Bateman, while not setting a personal best, jumped well enough to get into
        the finals and place eighth overall. With eight places scoring (10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1)
        this gave MIT a much needed four point advantage over their seed.
    
    
      
    
    Uzoma Orji took to the hammer circle as the number one seed
        and on his first throw, with darkness starting to set in, launched a 205-9
        school and meet record.  With all of his throws over 190 feet, Orji
        showed he is getting ready for the NCAA championships in three weeks.
    
    
      
    
    The only track event on the first day was the 10K.  MIT
        had three entries in the event with Eric Khatchadourian seeded sixth and
        Steve Maltas seeded seventh.  Maltas and Khatchadourian as well as Joe
        Roy-Mayhew went with the pack, running a casual 5:15 first mile, 10:27
        second mile and 15:44 third mile.  Maltas stayed on pace through the
        fourth mile with a 20:57 split but Khatchadourian and Roy-Mayhew fell off
        the pace to 21:05 and 21:07 respectively.  In the fifth mile Maltas
        dropped off the pace a little and a lot more in the sixth.  Nevertheless,
        he was able to 33:01.84 to hold onto third place.  Roy-Mayhew passed
        Khatchadourian at the start of the sixth mile and finished in sixth place
        with Khatchadourian, who is still getting back his strength from his bout
        with the flu, just behind in seventh.  Maltas's
        bonus six points put MIT 10 points up on the first day.
    
    
      
    
    Day two started off the triple jump.  Anthony Teixeira,
        who had jumped to a 20-9 1/4 personal best in the long jump on Friday, had
        to jump without one contact as he had developed pink eye during the long
        jump competition and the medication received at the hospital prevented him
        from putting in his other contact.  This affected his depth perception,
        causing him to abort his first two attempts.  On his third attempt he
        jumped 42-11 but that missed finals by a couple of inches and one spot. "Tex"
        proceeded over to the 110HH trials where he qualified for the finals and
        eventually placed sixth, scoring three unexpected points for the Engineers.
    
    
      
    
    Jake Ruzevick, unable to practice early in the week due to
        the flu, was seeded fourth in the steeplechase.  He, Chris Bruce and
        Rocco Repetski toed the line for Tech at the start of the race.  After
        the first mile it was clear Ruzevick was not at the top of his game.  He
        had also developed a technique problem that was leading to his quads getting
        fatigued prematurely.  Chris Bruce stepped up and ran with the leaders
        until the end of the race, running a huge personal best, placing sixth in
        9:39.27.  Ruzevick "gutted it out" to finish seventh in 9:41.72.  While
        not placing, Repetski ran an eight second PR for a 10:04.42 performance.  MIT
        scored the five points it was seeded for but not in the expected manner. 
    
    
      
    
    In the 4x100, MIT was seeded sixth but their goal of running
        sub 43 would certainly move them up.  David Blau led things off with
        a fantastic leg to put Tech in first at the first exchange.  Kenny Rosche
        also ran an exceptional leg putting MIT in a great position.  The handoff
        between Rosche and Wozniak could not have been any better and Wozniak proceeded
        to run a screaming curve.  The final handoff to Demario Dayton was also
        excellent.  Dayton stumbled slightly getting going allowing a couple
        of teams to catch up.  The team finished in fourth, running 42.73 to
        reach their goal and score two more points than they were seeded.
    
    
      
    
    Fivos Constantinou knew if her were going to score in the 1500
        that he would probably have to win the slow section.  The first quarter
        was plenty fast at 62 seconds but the second quarter slowed to 2:09.  Constantinou
        took over, running a little too aggressively with a 61 third quarter to come
        through 1200 in 3:10.  Fatiguing as one might expect, Constantinou nevertheless
        held onto second place in the section, running a season best of 3:59.81.  Overall,
        he finished in eighth to provide MIT with yet one more unexpected point.
    
    
      
    
    The meet had gone so well for the Engineers that the coaching
        staff was beginning to wonder if this might be the perfect meet.  Once
        Omari Stephens, a third seed in the pole vault, went out at 12-9, the wondering
        was over.  The loss of the six points would be something the Engineers
        would have to make up.
    
    
      
    
    Orji took to the shot put circle in similar fashion to the
        hammer the night before, although this time it took him two throws to set
        a season best and a new meet record of 58-7 1/2.  James Oleinik, seeded
        sixth, did not disappoint.  For most of the competition Oleinik was
        in fifth place but lost that position in the final round.  Oleinik threw
        48-2 1/2 to almost match his personal best.
    
    
      
    
    In an event where MIT thought they had a sure point total of
        at least six, the 100 meter dash proved to be anything but.  After running
        a casual 10.97 in the trials, Blau appeared ready to take care of business.  In
        the set position, Blau flinched a little and thinking he would be called
        for a false start he had already dropped down from his "set" position and
        failed to go with the gun.  Once
        he realized his error he ran the 100 to secure the one point.
    
    
      
    
    Orji again took to the circle, this time for the discus.  Seeded
        fifth and struggling all season with his least favorite throwing event, MIT
        was hoping for status quo at best.  However, being the champion that
        he is, Orji threw a season best of 150-0 on his final throw to move up to
        fourth place, making up for one of the lost points.
    
    
      
    
    The only event remaining in which the Engineers had a good
        opportunity to score   was the 200.  Blau, obviously upset about the
        100, got out a little too hard, clearly leading a very talented field into
        the final straight.  While three of the top seeds passed him, Blau held
        on to place one position higher than he was seeded, giving MIT five points.
    
    
      
    
    Going into the final event, the 1600 meter relay, MIT was in
        second with Tufts three and a half points back.  Tufts had the fifth
        fastest relay time and MIT the 13th.  If Tufts ran their seed they would
        score four points and surpass MIT for second.  MIT, racing in the unseeded
        section was unable to run their best, placing third in their section.  At
        the start of the seeded section, Middlebury, a higher seed than Tufts was
        called for movement in the set position thus getting disqualified from the
        race.  Tufts proceeded to place fifth, scoring the necessary four points
        to overtake MIT.  Tufts performed well and left all of their top distance
        runners out of the meet, which would have surely put them in second easily.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT is host to the All Division New England Championship
        for men and women (NEICAAA) Thursday through Saturday.

    **BLAU SPRINTS HIS WAY TO GREAT
        TIMES IN NEICAAA CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    May 12-13, 2006
    
    
      
    
    On a windy and rainy weekend athletes from New England colleges
        of all divisions braved the elements to compete in the NEICAAA Championship
        hosted by MIT.  Over 40 teams for both men and women and 700 athletes  brought
        their best to the championship won by UConn on the women's side with 229
        1/4 points and the University of Rhode Island on the men's side with 124
        1/2 points.
    
    
      
    
    While the weather was predicted to be the worst for both Friday
        and Saturday, Friday did not bring the torrents of rain.  It was windy
        and overcast with temperatures hovering in the mid 50's.  Saturday however
        was as miserable as it can get in mid May.  Temperatures were in the
        50's and wind was not quite as strong as on Friday but the rain was relentless.  It
        rained so much the drainage system was overflowing near the end of the meet
        and all of the electrical boxes being used to run the finish line system
        were underwater.
    
    
      
    
    In spite of the uncooperative weather, many MIT athletes produced
        personal bests.  David Blau ran his way to a fifth place in the 100
        with a 10.89 time and a seventh in the 200 with a 21.96 personal best.  The
        races were originally set up as trials on Friday and finals on Saturday.  With
        the clear evidence of the rains coming in on Saturday the coaches decided
        to move all events from the 400IH and 400 down to the 100 to sections on
        time to be competed on Friday.  Blau made the most of his opportunity
        scoring all but one of MIT's points.
    
    
      
    
    With Uzoma Orji competing at the IC4A Championship at Princeton
        University, freshman James Oleinik took up the slack and threw a personal
        best of 48-9 in the shot put to place eighth. 
    
    
      
    
    On the women's side, MIT placed 15th overall with 17 points.  Leading
        the way was Chi-Fong Wang in the javelin with a throw of 128-3 into the strong
        winds to place 4th.  Also placing fourth was the 4x800 team of Adrienne
        Bolger, Andrea Bradshaw, Hana Adaniya and Rachel Niehuus.  The quartet
        ran 9:39.4 to finish as the top division III team.  Freshman Emily Hwang
        finished sixth in the pole vault with a leap of 10-11 3/4.  Leanne Veldhuis
        ran a personal best in the 400IH to place seventh in 64.86.  Another
        personal best was established by Aline Thomas, who threw 156-1 in the hammer
        to finish eighth.  The final personal best was established by Betsy
        Eames.  Running her third 10K in as many weeks, she dropped her time
        by over 30 seconds to 38:55.33 to also place eighth.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, those with a chance to qualify for the NCAA Championship
        will be traveling to Springfield College to compete in the ECAC Championship
        on Thursday and Friday, May 18-19.

    **MIT WINS SIXTH STRAIGHT NEWMAC
        CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    April 29, 2006
    
    
      
    
    MIT played host to the eighth annual NEWMAC
          Outdoor Track and Field championship, and similar to six of the previous
          meets and the last five in succession, MIT ran, jumped and threw their
          way to the victory.  Seeded third behind Springfield College and Coast
          Guard Academy, MIT was put at a further disadvantage as the flu continued
          to take out members of the team.  Nevertheless, the Engineers rose
          to the challenge, setting 24 personal bests en route to a 36.5 point victory
          over Coast Guard, 214.5 to 178 with Springfield College 11.5 points behind
          Coast Guard.
    
    
      
    
    Tech started things going in the right direction in the first
        event as Spencer Dudley and Joe Roy-Mayhew ran personal bests to claim first
        and second ahead of a strong group of Coast Guard and Springfield runners
        in the 10,000 meter race.  Both
        ran New England Division III qualifying times with performances of 32:57.33
        and 33:32.43 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    Right after the 10K, MIT came out big in the 3000 Steeplechase.  Chris
        Bruce ran behind the number two seeded from Coast Guard, in part because
        of the wind but also to help MIT's other runners stay in the pack longer.  With
        Three and a half laps to go Bruce opened up a huge lead with back to back
        77 second laps.  Rocco Repetski initially went with him, passing the
        Coast Guard runner but not dropping him.  Repetski lost the battle for
        second in the final straight but ran a personal best of 10:12.80 to earn
        third place.  Kevin DiGenova ran a huge season best and within a tenth
        of a second of his personal best, placing fifth with his 10:33.21.  Finishing
        with a great kick, Ryan King set a personal best of 10:34.14 for sixth.  Using
        the 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 scoring format generally used for championship meets,
        the steeple finished netted MIT 23 points to go with their 18 from the 10K.
    
    
      
    
    MIT did not let the momentum drop off as the 4x100 team of
        David Blau, Kenny Rosche, Thad Wozniak and Demario Dayton dropped over seven
        tenths from their season best to place second with a time of 43.23.
    
    
      
    
    In the field events, Tech's long jumpers continued their amazing
        improvement.  On their fifth and sixth jumps of the competition, Wozniak
        and Chris Bateman moved from fifth and third respectively to first and second.  Anthony
        Teixeira moved from eighth to seventh on his last jump to add two more points
        to make it 20 for the long jump. Wozniak and Teixeira jumped to personal
        bests with marks of 22-0 3/4 and 20-6 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    Uzoma Orji planned on duplicating his three event victory that
        he pulled off his sophomore year but with the improved throwers from Springfield
        College, particularly in the discus, he would have to throw a season best
        at the very least.  Orji's first events was the hammer throw.  He
        proceeded to throw two personal bests back to back, finishing with 195-5
        to move him up to second best on the NCAA Division III list.  In the
        discus, an event Orji has struggled with over the years, he threw 147-10
        on his third throw to win the event by a mere two inches.  In the shot
        put, Orji had a great series, throwing 58-6, a season best, on his fifth
        throw to easily win the event.  James Oleinik threw 46-11 1/4 for fourth
        place in the shot to support Orji's efforts.  Despite being overmatched
        by Springfield and Coast Guard with their team numbers, Orji and Oleinik
        still outscored their two opponents in the three throwing events.
    
    
      
    
    MIT was seeded 5-6-7-8 in the 1500 but with Eric Khatchadourian
        out with the flu and Jake Ruzevick trying to hold the effects of the flu
        in check their opponents seemed to have a distinct edge.  Ruzevick,
        Fivos Constantinou and Yermie Cohen had different plans.  The first
        quarter, taken out by first seed, Mike Flint of Coast Guard, in 61 seconds
        guaranteed a reasonably fast race despite the strong wind.  The second
        quarter slowed to 2:09 but picked back up in the third quarter as Ruzevick
        moved up towards the front, coming through in 3:14.  Constantinou and
        Cohen powered to second and fourth with Ruzevick in the middle.  Ruzevick
        finished in second with Constantinou holding onto third in 4:01.67 and 4:01.94.  Cohen
        dropped back in the final 200 but nevertheless held on to 6th with a season
        best of 4:06.55.
    
    
      
    
    Omari Stephens had quite a show of his own and all the events
        were happening at about the same time.  Stephen's best performance came
        in the pole vault where he beat the top seed from Coast Guard with a personal
        best leap of 14-6.  Just prior to the end of the vault, Stephens ran
        15.88 in the 110HH to place third.  At the same time, the triple jump
        was going on.  Stephens did not miss a beat as he jumped to a personal
        best of 42-7 to earn second place.  Anthony Teixeira ran nearly eight
        tenths faster than ever before in the 110HH to support Stephens with a sixth
        place 15.92 performance.  Teixeira also did his part in the triple jump
        with a third place finish.  Bateman came back in the triple jump, setting
        a personal best of 41-8 3/4 to give MIT the 2-3-4 finish.
    
    
      
    
    Back on the track Alex Rothberg was able to run a strong 51.15
        to give MIT five points for fourth place in the 400 meters.  Ulzie Rea
        was not able to race due to a back injury.  Springfield College took
        advantage, placing first and third for 16 points.
    
    
      
    
    In the 100, David Blau ran an incredible personal best of 10.86
        in the trials, placing second in the finals.  Kenny Rosche ran 11.15
        to place seventh, giving MIT a strong showing in the event.
    
    
      
    
    The 800 squad took a hit when Ruzevick was unable to come back
        from the 1500 due to his bout of illness.  Aron Walker, feeling the
        effects of a minor injury also was not at his best.  Dan Rodgers and
        Constantinou hoped to hold off the Coast Guard runners by themselves.  Coast
        Guard was able to score 17 points in the event with a second win by Flint
        and a fourth and seventh place.  Springfield managed second and third
        while Rodgers ran a tough race for fourth and Constantinou held on for eighth.
    
    
      
    
    Coast Guard and Springfield were coming back on MIT but would
        it be too little, too late.  Coast Guard placed 1-2-3 in the high jump
        for 24 points and 1-3 in the javelin for 16 points.  MIT was unable
        to score in either event, giving up an uncontested 40 points.
    
    
      
    
    The 400IH was an event where MIT hoped to gain some ground.  John
        McGonagle was seeded sixth but he had confidence he could place as high as
        third. The loan MIT entry in the event, McGonagle got off to a strong
        start and was looking great through the half way point in the race.  Going
        into the sixth hurdle McGonagle nearly stopped as he seemed unprepared for
        the hurdle.  He recovered to maintain sixth place with a personal best
        of 59.21 but the opportunity for gain was lost.
    
    
      
    
    The 200 was the event where MIT hoped to put the meet away.  With
        only the 5000 and 1600 relay remaining, if the sprinters could pull off a
        strong representation the championship trophy would remain at MIT.  Running
        into the wind, Blau ran a very strong half lap, finishing second in 22.66. Wozniak
        ran 23.25 to finish sixth and Alex Rothberg earned eighth place with a 23.60
        performance.  MIT's 12 points were enough to wrap up their sixth consecutive
        title.
    
    
      
    
    In the 5000, the absence of Khatchadourian no longer a concern,
        Steve Maltas was expected to hold off the Coast Guard runners by himself.  Chris
        Wong, still feeling the effects of the flu was not at his best.  Cohen
        returned from the 1500 to compete in his first 5K ever.  After a strong
        first mile, running with the lead group of two Coast Guard and one Wheaton
        runner, Maltas was overcome with stomach problems and was unable to hold
        onto the fast pace.  Wong was unable to run at his best but was holding
        on.  Cohen, perhaps finding his niche, moved up throughout the race,
        finishing the final 200 in 34 seconds to finish fourth in 15:54.75.  Maltas
        faded but held onto sixth position while Wong was able to finish seventh.
    
    
      
    
    The highlight of the 4x400 for MIT was the anchor leg run by
        Rosche.  The indoor freshman record holder in the 400, ran his first
        400 of the year as he was just getting into racing condition after a long
        volleyball season.  Rosche got into a good battle and nearly walked
        down the Coast Guard runner for second place, missing by .07 seconds.  His
        split was 50.7 after a long day where he ran four previous races (100 trials
        and finals, 400 relay and 200).
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT travels to Springfield College to compete in
        the New England Division III Championship on Friday and Saturday.  MIT,
        seeded no higher than fourth going into the meet is hoping for another stellar
        performance to move them up into the top three teams.

    **ENGINEERS FINISH REGULAR SEASON UNDEFEATED IN WAY
        OVER BATES, COLBY AND SOUTHERN MAINE**
    
    
      
    
    April 15, 2006
    
    
      
    
    The MIT men's track and field team stepped up big in a quadrangular
        meet at Lewiston, Maine versus host Bates College, Colby College and the
        University of Southern Maine to finish the regular season undefeated with
        a record of 7-0.  Bates College provided superb competition as the meet
        was not decided until the final few events with MIT putting the meet away
        with a 1-2-3-4 finish in the 5000 to score a total of 244 points to 208 for
        Bates, 104 for USM and 89 for Colby.
    
    
      
    
    The day before the meet MIT received some bad news as their
        leading point scorer, multi event specialist, Thad Wozniak, was diagnosed
        with a blood clot in his shoulder area, precluding him from competing in
        the meet.  A few minutes later, John McGonagle, MIT's only intermediate
        hurdler came to practice with a splint on his ankle, preventing him from
        competing as well.
    
    
      
    
    Bates is a strong, well coached team, and had showed as much
        in the indoor New England Division III Championships as the Bobcats edged
        out the Engineers for third place.  MIT would need to step up in the
        areas that Wozniak was a key factor; long jump, both relays and the 200 as
        well as start to run at the level they are capable of.
    
    
      
    
    The first indication that MIT meant to do something special
        was in the 3000 steeplechase.   Freshman Jake Ruzevick, running
        like his old self, ran an extraordinary steeplechase in his second ever race
        at the event.  Ruzevick pulled ahead with about a lap and a half to
        go, opened up a 20 meter lead that was growing on the final homestretch.  He
        ended up too close to the final barrier, catching his lead leg and falling,
        allowing Johnson of Bates to pass him.  Ruzevick nevertheless ran a
        superb race with a final time of 9:41.63.  Supporting his PR, Rocco
        Repetski and Ryan King ran PRs of their own in 10:22.22 and 10:37.23 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    In the 4x100, Omari Stephens took over for Wozniak and Kenny
        Rosche, competing for the first time after a long volleyball season, entered
        in the event where he helped MIT to a fourth place finish at the 2005 New
        England Division III Championship.  Stephens took off five meters too
        early for the second handoff, managed to slow down enough to get the exchange
        and MIT managed to finish second despite the two new legs.
    
    
      
    
    The jumpers did not produce the distances they were looking
        for, but they competed very well and got the job done.  Chris Bateman,
        Anthony Teixeira and Obinna Anyanwu made up for the lack of Wozniak in the
        long jump by placing 1-2-3.  Similarly, Stephens, Teixeira, Bateman
        and Anyanwu placed 1-2-3-6 in the triple jump.
    
    
      
    
    In the sprints, MIT held their own.  David Blau pulled
        away in the 100 to win in 11.24.  In the 200, the runner in lane one
        appeared to outside Blau's field of vision as he pulled away on the homestretch,
        but Blau still secured second place.  In both events, Blau received
        support from Rosche who placed fifth in the 100 and seventh in the 200.  Ulzie
        Rea continued to run very well despite a bad back as he placed third in 51.63.  Alex
        Rothberg finished fourth in the 400 and fifth in the 200 to provide even
        more points.
    
    
      
    
    In the throws, Uzoma Orji and James Oleinik took care of business
        even if they did not have their best outing of the season.  Orji placed
        second in the hammer but won the shot put and discus.  Oleinik threw
        a season best in the shot put with a toss of 46-2 1/2 for third and finished
        sixth in both the hammer and discus.
    
    
      
    
    With Bates College closing on MIT's early lead, the Tech 800
        runners took matters into their own hands.  Aron Walker, running poorly
        the week before, perhaps due to not following the prescribed warmup, put
        it together this time. With three hundred meters to go he took off ,
        winning the slow section by fifteen meters and placing second overall in
        2:00.26.  Dan Rodgers ran his first 800 of the outdoor season, overcame
        the fever he had most of the week and posted a fine 2:00.52 in the fast section
        to finish third overall.  Fivos Constantinou came from the back of the
        pack to finish fifth in 2:01.38 after running 4:05.41 in the 1500 where he
        placed third.
    
    
      
    
    The event that clinched the win, the 5000, sported seven MIT
        runners.  With Joe Roy-Mayhew, a 15:53 under his belt already this season
        was sitting out with an injury, Khatchadourian decided he wanted to double,
        both for the points but also to help pace the other Tech runners to a 5:00
        per mile pace.  True to form, Khatch hit pace right on until the half
        way point where he threw in two 74s to come through two miles in 9:58.  At
        this point only one opponent, a Bates runner, was managing to stay with Khatch,
        Spencer Dudley, Steve Maltas and Chris Wong and he was beginning to fade.  At
        two and a half miles Wong was slowing to 79 second pace and Maltas dropped
        a 78.  Khatch and Dudley threw in 1:44 final 600s to run 15:27.56
        and 15:28.45 respectively.  Dudley's time was his second PR in as many
        weeks.  Maltas finished third in a personal best of 15:39.94 and Wong
        ran a season best of 15:41.92 to finish fourth after his 31 second final
        200 nearly caught back up to Maltas.
    
    
      
    
    Tech closed out the meet with a season best 3:26.25 4x400.  Next
        week, MIT hosts the Spring Invitational for 12 teams from all NCAA divisions,
        which will be the final tuneup before the NEWMAC Championships, also at MIT,
        on 4/29.

    **MIT PREPARES FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS
        WITH FINAL TUNE-UP**
    
    
      
    
    April 22, 2006
    
    
      
    
    Despite windy and cool conditions many MIT athletes set season
        or personal bests in the Spring Invitational as they showed they are ready
        for the championships to begin.  Colleges represented were Bentley,
        Bryant, Emanuel, Fitchburg State, Merrimack, Naval Academy Prep School, Regis,
        Stonehill, UMass Lowell, URI, Wellesley and Wheaton.
    
    
      
    
    In the 100, the finish line was changed to take advantage of
        the wind.  Taking advantage of this, although for this one section the
        automatic timing system failed, were Kenny Rosche and Demario Dayton, running
        10.8 and 11.0 handtimes respectively.  Rosche, recently out for track
        after a long volleyball season, is returning to last year's condition as
        he ran 23.19 in the 200.
    
    
      
    
    In the 400, Alex Rothberg ran a personal best of 51.10 despite
        a strong wind during the 400.  Rothberg came back later for another
        PR in the 200, running 22.95.
    
    
      
    
    The strongest running event for MIT was the 800 meters.  MIT
        placed 2-5 with Jake Ruzevick leading the way with a personal best of 1:58.04.  Aron
        Walker won an earlier section in 1:58.93, also a personal best.  Continuing
        the trend, Dan Rodgers was just behind Walker with a personal best of 1:59.27.  Also
        running well were Fivos Constantinou and Yermie Cohen, running 1:59.45 and
        2:00.07 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    The other personal best on the track was provided by Tyler
        Abrams as he ran 16:12.59 in the 5000.  Also running well in the distance
        events was Chris Bruce winning the 3000 Steeplechase in 10:03.24, Brian Jacokes
        running 16:17.70 in the 5000 and Steve Maltas running a casual New England
        Division III qualifying time of 33:16.17 in the 10K.
    
    
      
    
    In the field events, the long jump turned out to be the premier
        event for the Engineers.  Chris Bateman popped a huge personal best
        of 21-8 1/4 to finish second in the event.  Thad Wozniak and Anthony
        Teixeira also PR'd with leaps of 21-2 1/2 and 20-4 1/2 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    Nate Sharpe continued to learn and improve in the pole vault
        as he cleared 12-0.  Also doing well in the field events were James
        Oleinik with a new personal best in the shot put, throwing 48-4 and a personal
        best in the hammer by Uzoma Orji, throwing 189-4.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT hosts the NEWMAC Conference Championship, beginning
        at 11:00 on Saturday, April 29.  MIT has won the past five championships
        in succession and six of the seven championships since the conference began
        in 1999.  This year, both Springfield College and Wheaton College pose
        serious challenges to MIT in their defense as conference champion.

    **TECH LEADS OFF  SEASON WITH
        WIN IN SPRING FLING MEET**
    
    
      
    
    March 29, 2006
    
    
      
    
    MIT traveled to Clermont, Florida for their spring break trip,
        looking for some good warm weather training and competition.  After
        a couple days of good, hard workouts Tech lined up in the Spring Fling Meet
        against Colby College of Maine and Grinnell College of Iowa.  Only having
        brought 19 of their team members there were some holes in the lineup, but
        the same was true with the opposing teams.
    
    
      
    
    MIT claimed every running event they entered, including the
        relays, with only the 400IH being void an MIT runner.  The only double
        winner in the running events was David Blau, running 11.1 and 22.34 to claim
        the 100 and 200 meter races with excellent early season performances.  The
        only other double victor was Omari Stephens, who won the pole vault at 13-0
        and the 110HH in the personal best of 15.88.
    
    
      
    
    Other victories were earned by  Alex Rothberg in the 400 in
        51.17 with a very well paced effort.  Placing second and fourth, also
        breaking 52 seconds were Ulzie Rea and Alex Rothberg.  In the 800, Dave
        Reshef ran from behind, nearly even-splitting a 2:01.74 victory.  Joining
        him in third and fourth were Matt Bieniosek and Fivos Constantinou.
    
    
      
    
    Constantinou earlier ran away with the 1500 victory, leading
        from start to finish, winning with a fine time of 4:04.97.  Yermie Cohen
        supported with a fourth place effort.  Chris Bruce also led from start
        to finish, running 10:12.22 in the 3000 steeplechase.  Bruce went out
        in a very strong pace but faltered in the final two and a half laps.
    
    
      
    
    Jake Ruzevick did not have a good day, possibly suffering from
        exhaustion, but ran to victory anyway in the 5000.  Eric Khatchadourian
        was the only entrant in the 10K, but his 33:16.06 was nevertheless a strong
        early season performance.
    
    
      
    
    MIT won both relays, winning the 4x100 in 43.94 with two to
        three alternate legs.  The second handoff was the only poor one, one
        which required Thad Wozniak, the outgoing runner to slow down significantly
        at the end of the exchange zone to received the baton from Dan Rodgers.  Blau
        and Rothberg took care of the two ends to bring Tech to victory.  In
        the 4x400, Rothberg led off with a less than perfect 52.5 effort. Rodgers
        also ran slower than his open time, only clocking a 52.5 leg.  Reshef
        ran a superb 52.3 was a personal best 400 relay leg.  Bieniosek put
        the victory away with a 52.7 anchor.
    
    
      
    
    Uzoma Orji did not have his usual superb meet.  All the
        field event athletes worked really hard on Monday and Tuesday, even working
        out the morning of the meet.  The fatigue showed as the big man only
        threw 53-2 1/2 in the shot put to win.  He was only able to claim second
        places in the discus and hammer as he just could not get anything going.  Chris
        Bateman took the long jump with a leap of 19-8 1/2 to lead a three man sweep
        of the event.  A notable second place effort was put in by James Oleinik
        in the shot put with a throw of 45-2 1/2.
    
    
      
    
    On Saturday, MIT travels to Gainsville to compete against Division
        I power houses in the U. of Florida Diet Pepsi Invitational.
