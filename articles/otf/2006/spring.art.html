    WITH FINAL TUNE-UP</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 22, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">Despite windy and cool conditions many MIT athletes set season
    or personal bests in the <a href="spring.res.html">Spring Invitational</a> as they showed they are ready
    for the championships to begin.&nbsp; Colleges represented were Bentley,
    Bryant, Emanuel, Fitchburg State, Merrimack, Naval Academy Prep School, Regis,
    Stonehill, UMass Lowell, URI, Wellesley and Wheaton.</p>
  <p align="left">In the 100, the finish line was changed to take advantage of
    the wind.&nbsp; Taking advantage of this, although for this one section the
    automatic timing system failed, were Kenny Rosche and Demario Dayton, running
    10.8 and 11.0 handtimes respectively.&nbsp; Rosche, recently out for track
    after a long volleyball season, is returning to last year's condition as
    he ran 23.19 in the 200.</p>
  <p align="left">In the 400, Alex Rothberg ran a personal best of 51.10 despite
    a strong wind during the 400.&nbsp; Rothberg came back later for another
    PR in the 200, running 22.95.</p>
  <p align="left">The strongest running event for MIT was the 800 meters.&nbsp; MIT
    placed 2-5 with Jake Ruzevick leading the way with a personal best of 1:58.04.&nbsp; Aron
    Walker won an earlier section in 1:58.93, also a personal best.&nbsp; Continuing
    the trend, Dan Rodgers was just behind Walker with a personal best of 1:59.27.&nbsp; Also
    running well were Fivos Constantinou and Yermie Cohen, running 1:59.45 and
    2:00.07 respectively.</p>
  <p align="left">The other personal best on the track was provided by Tyler
    Abrams as he ran 16:12.59 in the 5000.&nbsp; Also running well in the distance
    events was Chris Bruce winning the 3000 Steeplechase in 10:03.24, Brian Jacokes
    running 16:17.70 in the 5000 and Steve Maltas running a casual New England
    Division III qualifying time of 33:16.17 in the 10K.</p>
  <p align="left">In the field events, the long jump turned out to be the premier
    event for the Engineers.&nbsp; Chris Bateman popped a huge personal best
    of 21-8 1/4 to finish second in the event.&nbsp; Thad Wozniak and Anthony
    Teixeira also PR'd with leaps of 21-2 1/2 and 20-4 1/2 respectively.</p>
  <p align="left">Nate Sharpe continued to learn and improve in the pole vault
    as he cleared 12-0.&nbsp; Also doing well in the field events were James
    Oleinik with a new personal best in the shot put, throwing 48-4 and a personal
    best in the hammer by Uzoma Orji, throwing 189-4.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT hosts the NEWMAC Conference Championship, beginning
    at 11:00 on Saturday, April 29.&nbsp; MIT has won the past five championships
    in succession and six of the seven championships since the conference began
    in 1999.&nbsp; This year, both Springfield College and Wheaton College pose
    serious challenges to MIT in their defense as conference champion.</p>
