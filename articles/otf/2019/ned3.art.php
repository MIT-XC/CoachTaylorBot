                  <h3>Men Win Sixth New England Division III Title in a Row                  </h3>
                  <h4>Women Finish a Close Second</h4>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>May 4, 2019              </p>
              <p>In the end, the&nbsp;Men's and Women 's Track &amp; Field teams from MIT did what they were supposed to do at the <a href="ned3.res.php">New England Division III Championship</a>, but they did it a bit better. The men, seeded for 122 points, scored 139.5, 50 points more than runner-up Tufts.&nbsp; The women, seeded to finish second with 77 points, scored a surprising 101.5, falling just 9.5 short of heavily favored Williams College.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Despite the rain on Friday, overall the weather was nice with 60-65 degree temperatures both days&nbsp;with very little wind for a change.&nbsp; In an age when athletes tend to be much more focused on personal bests or qualifying for the next championship, the rain tends to affect them.&nbsp; Whereas, MIT, focused more on competing, took advantage of the relatively poor competition to score major&nbsp;points on Friday.&nbsp; Seeded for 24 points on Friday in the 10K, Hammer, Javelin and Long Jump, the men scored 44 points.</p>
              <p>In the Long Jump, Yorai Shaoul '21 jumped 23-9 1/2 to easily win the event, and Alec Reduker '20, who had only jumped once before ever, and that was three weeks ago, added to his legend by going 23-0&nbsp;1/2 for second place, giving his team three points more than they were seeded.</p>
              <p>In the throws, Albert Menio '20 stepped up big in the Hammer, throwing a personal best of 161-1 to place sixth after not being seeded to score at all.&nbsp; Gabe Madonna '20 and Cooper Driscoll '22 both made the finals of the Javelin with Madonna placing as he was seeded, fourth with a throw of 179-4.</p>
              <p>Not having run a 10K all year before last week, the trio of Josh Rosenkranz '19, Finn&nbsp;Jacobson-Schulte '21 and Josh Derrick '20 qualified with last week's effort.&nbsp; Racing 10K's in back to back weeks is not usually recommended, particularly with mileage as low as Rosenkranz and Derrick were putting in.&nbsp; However, it was assumed they had run well within their abilities the week before and therefore had plenty left in the tank.&nbsp; With a relatively weak field, it was assumed no&nbsp;one would be capable of running sub 32:00 other than the MIT runners.&nbsp; At the gun, Trevor Wysong of Bridgewater State College, a pretty good runner in the past&nbsp;who had not run fast this season, ran a 70 first 400, opening up a pretty good gap.&nbsp; MIT runners were coached to run 77-78 pace for the first three or four miles if there was no one willing to do so.&nbsp; Two other runners had good out with Wysong, but it was clear they were coming back.&nbsp; Would Wysong hold it was the question.&nbsp; After three successive 5:08 1600's, the three MIT runners started to go after the leader, who by that time was 23 seconds up.&nbsp; Rosenkranz led the attack&nbsp;with Jacobson right on him.&nbsp; Derrick fell off after the 5:03 fourth 1600, but not too much.&nbsp; Their fifth 1600 went down to 5:01 as they were closing the gap&nbsp;and although Derrick was now 11 seconds back, he was still in fifth place.&nbsp; Rosenkranz and Jacobson were not able to close the gap enough, falling five seconds short as Rosenkranz finished second in 31:40.73 and Jacobson third in 31:42.51.&nbsp; Derrick remained in fifth in 32:05.09.&nbsp;&nbsp;After being seeded for one point the 18 point performance gave the Engineers a nice advantage going into day two.</p>
              <p>On Saturday&nbsp;the Engineers were dealt the blow that Aidan Gilson '19, the top seed in the 3K Steeplechase, could not run due to an achilles injury.&nbsp; With no 4x100 and no one in the Steeplechase or 1500 Tech had to sit on their 44 points until the 110HH.&nbsp; In the meantime, the Shot Put was underway, an event where MIT could do some damage.&nbsp; The freshmen really stepped up.&nbsp; Seeded for 10 points the freshmen came through with 13 points.&nbsp; Will Woltmann '22, coming off a freak injury, put it together, earning third place with a throw of 49-11 1/4.&nbsp; Ryan Nall '22 had a huge personal best of 48-4 1/4 to place fourth&nbsp;and Nathan Basinger '22 added to last week's performance by placing seventh at 46-6 3/4.</p>
              <p>Joa Kennedy '21, over his ankle sprain from two weeks ago, ran an impressive personal best of 15.10 on&nbsp;Friday to advance to&nbsp;the finals in&nbsp;the 110 HH.&nbsp; In the final, he was less than perfect, but outstanding enough to place fifth in 15.43 after not being seeded to score.</p>
              <p>The points kept piling up for Tech as they scored 10 in the 400 after being seeded for only five.&nbsp; Benton Wilson '21 ran a personal best of 48.62 to secure third place and Nick Duchatellier '22 also delivered a PR of 49.54 for fifth place.</p>
              <p>In&nbsp;the field events the jumpers were adding their own points.&nbsp; Seeded for 15 points in the High Jump they delivered 18.5.&nbsp; Alec Reduker '20, who won the event when he&nbsp;cleared 6-8, went for 7-1, but was unable to clear the height.&nbsp; Chris Washington '20 placed fourth at 6-6 and Caleb Harris '22 cleared 6-4 to tie for fifth.&nbsp; Shaoul added his second victory, this one in the Triple Jump.&nbsp; His best mark was 49-5 1/2, getting his team the 10 points for which he was seeded.</p>
              <p>Basinger and Menio again delivered for the throwers when they placed fourth and sixth respectively in the Discus.&nbsp; Basinger threw a 146-1 PR to earn fourth and Menio threw 144-5.</p>
              <p>Continuing to out perform their seeds, Wilson came back in the 200, earning a victory in a best of 21.56 after only being seeded for eight points.&nbsp; This puts him at 21st in the country for Division III, not quite good enough to earn a trip to Nationals.&nbsp; Not seeded to score, Andrew Shao '22 brought home a seventh place for two points in the 400IH, running a personal best 56.75.</p>
              <p>All good things must end, so did  outperforming their seeds.&nbsp; In the Pole&nbsp;Vault, seeded for 12, the Engineers delivered seven.&nbsp; Liam Ackerman&nbsp;'21 placed fourth at 14-7 1/2 and Max Hardy '21, not seeded to score, had a great day to deliver seventh place, also at 14-7 1/2.&nbsp; This trend continued in the&nbsp;5K.&nbsp; Steven Goldy '20 was not supposed to score, but delivered a personal best 15:05.17, running an exceptional race to place fifth.&nbsp; Andrew Mah '22, feeling the effects of a long year, lost focus in the latter stages of the race, falling back to eighth place in 15:11.89.&nbsp;Seeded for eight Tech only managed five points.</p>
              <p>MIT finished their scoring in the 4x800 relay.&nbsp; Although seeded to score well, MIT was using different personnel than when they ran their seed time, so place was going to be unpredictable.&nbsp; Aiden Foucault-Etheridge '22, dealing with a&nbsp;leg injury, had missed placing in the 800 out of the slow section by one place with a 1:54.93. However, he was able to deliver a 1:58.5 leadoff leg as his knee was beginning to bother him.&nbsp; Ellery Rajagopal '21 really delivered, bringing the baton around in 1:57.8, a big personal best to move the team up to a three-way tie for third.&nbsp; Matt Schofield '22 added a 1:57.2 huge PR to keep the team in the same spot, but closer to second place.&nbsp; Simon Alford '20, a proven excellent anchor leg, put down a very strong 1:55.8 to bring the team to second place for a cumulative time of 7:49.48.</p>
              <p>The women simply did not have enough weapons with so many illnesses and injuries happening this year.&nbsp; However, those who did compete did amazingly well.&nbsp; MIT was not supposed to score any points on Friday, yet they came away with 11.&nbsp; In the Long Jump, despite a painful back, Yilinn Yang '22 delivered a sixth place performance at&nbsp;a season best 17-8.&nbsp; Liana Reilly '21 added a surprise point for eighth place, jumping 17-0.</p>
              <p>Ignoring the wet circle, Folusho Jebutu '20 and Elise McCormack-Kuhman '20 finished fifth and sixth respectively in the Hammer.&nbsp; Jebutu earned a fifth with a throw of 151-0 and McCormack-Kuhman was awarded sixth with her throw of 148-7.</p>
              <p>This boost gave the women a little more hope of possibly catching Williams.&nbsp; Saturday started with the 10 points for which Jenna Melanson '20 was seeded in the 3K Steeplechase.&nbsp; The junior took the lead at the start and held it to the finish in 10:56.47.</p>
              <p>In the 1500, MIT was again not seeded to score points.&nbsp; However, Margaret Trautner '20 had other plans.&nbsp; She ran a very smart race after the field came through the 400 in 79, not panicing she moved up gradually.&nbsp; She ran 72, 71 and struggled a bit in the homestretch, but held onto third place in 4:38.23</p>
              <p>With no one in the 100HH or 400, MIT then turned to Michelle Menkiti '20 in the 100.&nbsp; Seeded for one point, Menkiti brought home three, placing sixth in a season best 12.36.</p>
              <p>In the High Jump, Reilly returned to competition to tie for fifth place at 5-2 1/4, 1/2 of a point more than she was seeded.</p>
              <p>Bailey Tregoning '19 and Trautner were seeded for 16 points in the 800, which was unlikely with Trautner having fatigue from the 1500.&nbsp;Both ran very smart races, letting the pace go out fast while they were satisfied in the back, coming through the 400 in 66.8.&nbsp; Tregoning probably waited a little too long to move up towards the front as she was unable to catch the leader, settling for second place with a season best 2:11.29, negatively splitting the race.&nbsp; Trautner came through big with a 2:13.63 season best for fifth place.</p>
              <p>Menkiti was up again, this time in the 200.&nbsp; She was not seeded to score, but competed well, charging hard in the final 50 to secure fourth place in a season best 25.36.</p>
              <p>While MIT was doing incredibly well, Williams was also performing well, yet losing ground due to some scratches.&nbsp; Originally seeded at 45 points more than MIT, the Engineers were knocking that difference down to a point that a strong finish may bring home their seventh consecutive NED3 outdoor title.</p>
              <p>Not seeded to score in the Discus, Jebutu continued to compete at her best.&nbsp; She threw a season best 123-7 to place fourth, giving Tech five more points.</p>
              <p>Although they were seeded for 19 points in the Triple Jump, that was not realistic, particularly with Yang's back hurting her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena Andree '22, jumping over 38' for the first time last week, repeated that performance, jumping 38-2 for third place.&nbsp; Lucy Lee&nbsp;'21 and Elizabeth Weeks '21 added a sixth and seventh at 37-5 3/4 and 37-4 1/2 respectively, netting 11 points.</p>
              <p>Katie Collins '21, seeded first in the 5K, did not disappoint.&nbsp; Going out in 5:22, the sophomore pulled away from the field right at the start.&nbsp; She slowed&nbsp;a bit for a 5:29 second 1600, but continued to open up her lead.&nbsp; She fatigued in the final 1600, running alone, but finished in first in 17:18.59.</p>
              <p>At&nbsp;this point, MIT was 15.5 points behind Williams and ready to give it everything to close the gap.&nbsp; In the 4x800&nbsp;the Engineers were hoping for a victory and that Williams would not score.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a solid lead-off of 2:19.4 by Marissa McPhillips '20, Skylar Brooks '20 got the baton in second and looked good at the beginning, splitting 69 even though she had lost two places.&nbsp; However, fatigue set in and the junior could only manage a 2:30, dropping the team to sixth place when she handed off to a fatigued Trautner.&nbsp; Trautner fought with everything she had, delivering a 2:16.6 to move the team up to fourth.&nbsp; Tregoning pulled the team up to third with a 2:14.5, too far out of second to be possible.&nbsp; Williams managed a seventh, so the lead was now 11.5.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Williams was favored to win the 4x400 and MIT was not seeded to score.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using every available body, MIT put together a competitive relay team, but Menkiti would be running her first ever competitive 400.&nbsp; Claire Melvin '22, having run the 400IH in 65.82 earlier in the meet, led off with a 60.3.&nbsp; Sarah Ishamuddin '21 delivered a 59.5 leg and Kristen Frombach '19 a 59.7.&nbsp; Menkiti anchored the team to a seventh place finish with a 58.5 for a total time of 3:58.17.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Williams delivered the win to bring the total difference to 19.5.</p>
              <p>Now it was only the Pole Vault remaining.&nbsp; It would be possible for the Engineers to catch their rival, but would require near perfection on their part as well as the Williams pole vaulters failing to deliver.&nbsp; When the dust settled, Kari Stromhaug&nbsp;'19 won the event at a season best height of 12-4 3/4.&nbsp; Lila Wine '21 cleared a personal best 11-6 1/4 for fifth place.&nbsp; Makenzie Patarino '19, completing her comeback from a serious shoulder injury, brought home a seventh place finish with a 11-0 1/4 performance.&nbsp; Anais Marenco '22 placed eighth at 11-0 1/4 to give MIT 16 points, not enough even if Williams did not score.&nbsp; Williams did score, tying for second for seven points and the eventual 9.5 point separation.</p>
              <p>The next stop on the competition schedule will be the NEICAAA Championship, an all division championship hosted by Southern Connecticut State University next Friday and Saturday.</p>
