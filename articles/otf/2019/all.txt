    ### Reduker Adds Long Jump to NCAA Plate           
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 16, 2019              
    
    
                  
    
    No less than five personal bests were set by MIT Track & Field athletes at their own MIT Final Qualifier.  The NCAA has to approve any meet that is conducted in the final week prior to the NCAA Division III Championship.  MIT has been the regional host for the third year in succession.  To enter the meet a competitor needs to be approximately ranked among the top 100 in the country for Division III.  This guarantees a high quality, but relatively small meet that lasts three hours or so.
    
    
                  
    
    Alec Reduker '20, already tied for first in the High Jump with his 7-0 1/4 jump, added the Long Jump to his NCAA repertoire by jumping a huge personal best 23-8 3/4 to move up to 16th on the NCAA list and fourth on the all-time MIT list.  The top 20 marks in each event qualify for the championship for the men and the top 22 for the women.
    
    
                  
    
    Liam Ackerman '21 cleared 16-3 1/2 to win the Pole Vault, moving up to #6 on the NCAA list.  Ackerman made a great attempt at 16-7, narrowly missing it.
    
    
                  
    
    Another amazing personal best was had by Will Woltmann '22.  The freshman thrower put the shot 52-5 1/4 to win the event and move up to 27th in the country, as well as fifth on the MIT all-time list.  A couple of fouls were much further, letting everyone know big things will happen in the years to come.
    
    
                  
    
    Benton Wilson '21 wanted to qualify in the 400 or 200 and ended up racing both events.  In the 400 he easily ran his best 400 ever, pulling away from the field with a very fast 48.33, which ranks him 29th among all Division III runners and now fifth on the all-time MIT list.  A relatively short time later he won the 200, but could only muster a 21.92, short of what he needs to make the NCAA field.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's 800 was the premier event of the evening.  Bailey Tregoning '19, already with a solid time of 2:11.01 agreed to help teammate Margaret Trautner '20 secure a faster time by taking out the pace. The reason Tregoning does not lead is that she tends to run too fast.  So going out in 61.8 was not a total surprise.  Trautner was hanging back in third, still fast at 63.0.  Tregoning continued her pace, coming through the 600 in 1:34.  Trautner moved into second and was trying to make up ground, but was still 20 meters back.  In the final 100 the wheels came off of Tregoning's proverbial bus, but she still finished second in 2:11.57.  Trautner finished third in 2:12.03, an outdoor personal best that moves her to 14th on the NCAA list and number two on the all-time MIT list.
    
    
                  
    
    Also of note, Liana Reilly '21 matched her season best of 5-4 1/4 in the High Jump.  She made a great attempt at 5-7, but just displaced the bar.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers are below their normal numbers they send to the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field championship, mostly due to injury and fatigue.  However, they do have a representative group.  The following are making the trip.

    ### Steeplers Dominate for Tech
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 20, 2019              
    
    
                  
    
    When Princeton University decided to move the distance festival part of the Larry Ellis Invitational from Friday evening to Saturday evening due to pending thunderstorms, MIT was not certain they could stick with their plans to bring select middle-distance and distance runners to the meet given that their own meet (Sean Collier Invitational) was on the same day.
    
    
                  
    
    Not only did everything work out, including the weather at the Princeton meet, but the Engineers took advantage of the competition.  Leading the way were the steeplers.  Jenna Melanson '20 ran a great race, taking the lead after coming through the 1600 mark in 5:33.  Taking the lead may have been the wrong decision as this caused her to think, in addition to not having competition.  The pace slowed to 86 and then 90, which she maintained to the finish in a season best, and national qualifying mark of 10:47.87. 
    
    
                  
    
    Aidan Gilson '19 was next, and he followed the same plan.  He raced well early, coming through the 1600 in an impressive 4:45 as he was with the leaders.  His next lap slowed to a 75 and as runners passed him he struggled to stay engaged and competitive.  He did not fall off much more and even kicked in the final 80 meters, also finishing in a season best and national qualifying mark of 9:08.03.
    
    
                  
    
    Earlier, Bailey Tregoning '19 and Margaret Trautner '20 raced the 800.  They were in a perfect section where at the back of the pack they were able to come through in 65-66 at the 400.  Both began to move and passed nearly the entire field on the backstretch and final turn.  Both started to fall apart a little over the final 120, but still finished with season bests.  Tregoning ran 2:12.34 and Trautner 2:13.64.
    
    
                  
    
    The final race of the day for MIT was the men's 5K with Andrew Mah '22 representing the Engineers.  Unfortunately Mah was seeded in the slower section as they only took this year's performances, not last year's.  The pace was slow, coming through the 1600 in 4:49.  Mah was not experienced or comfortable enough to take the lead, so he was subject to the pace at hand.  After a 4:48 second 1600 and another slow lap the pace picked up to 68 seconds, but only for one lap.  The changing pace got to Mah, who finished well, but could not kick with the leaders.  His 14:53.49 was a good race, but a wasted opportunity as the freshman tries to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship.

    The highlight on day one at the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field championship was the Men's Long Jump, at least as far as MIT was concerned.  The result saw the MIT record shattered--four times, and the Engineers leading the meet with 14 points.  The true sense of competition was embodied by Yorai Shaoul '21 and Alec Reduker '20.  They fed off each other, supported each other, were motivated by each other and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the event.  Watching athletes compete when they are only thinking about what they can accomplish instead of fearing what they think they cannot do is such a pleasure for the spectators and their coaches.  Seeded fifth and 16th going into the competition, no one could have predicted what happened in this event.  Reduker was in the first section and opened up with a 23-6 3/4 jump to take the lead.  Not satisfied, he snatched the MIT record with a 24-4 1/4 effort on his second attempt and he only started long jumping two months ago.  His third attempt was only a 24-2 1/4 effort, giving him the best trial series in MIT history--for a few minutes--and first place in the competition.  Yorai is an incredible athlete, but an even better competitor.  His first attempt a 24-4 1/2 MIT record.  Entering the finals they were sitting in second and third.  However, Reduker fouled his first two while two competitors passed him.  Shaoul's first attempt was yet another MIT record at 24-8 1/4.  On his final attempt Reduker put out a bomb of a jump at 24-8 1/4 to tie for second place.  Shaoul high fived his teammate and then raised him a 24-11 for sole possession of second place and the top two jumpers in MIT history.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Women's Pole Vault competition, 14th seed Kari Stromhaug '19 was perfect after her initial miss at 11-5 3/4, clearing 11-11 3/4, 12-3 1/2 and 12-5 1/2 on consecutive attempts.  However, at 12-7 1/2, although she had great attempts, she displaced the bar each time, possibly aided by the strong winds, particularly on the first attempt when she was over and the wind possibly pushed the pole back into the bar.  She continued her streak of earning All America honors at every national championship, garnering eighth place, giving MIT their first point.
    
    
                  
    
    Jenna Melanson '20, seeded sixth in the Steeplechase and a two-time All American in the event, had to withdraw from the competition due to two stress fractures in her foot, justed diagnosed two days earlier.  Aidan Gilson '19, also an All American last year in the Steeplechase, seeded 14th, was unable to compete to the best of his ability as he fought through the pain of his achilles injury.  He finished 19th.
    
    
                  
    
    The final competitor for MIT on day one was Gabe Madonna '20 in the Javelin Throw.  Madonna, seeded 13th entering the competition, did not have his best day, throwing 173-1 to finish 18th.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two of the three day competition was a light one for the Engineers.  First up was Reduker in the High Jump.  The opening height was 6-4 and none of the 20 qualified jumpers went out.  However, at 6-6, three went out and at 6-8 eight more failed to make it.  Three more failed to make 6-9 and three more 6-10 1/4.  With three jumpers remaining, Reduker was the only one who had not missed.  Jumping at 6-11 1/2, if no one made it Reduker would win.  Reduker's first attempt was excellent just barely displacing the bar.  His next two not so great.  Kyle Rollins from St. John Fisher made it on his second attempt to win the event, leaving Reduker with second place and a total of 14 points scored between his two events.
    
    
                  
    
    The only other event for Tech on this day was the women's 800.  Bailey Tregoning '19, seeded ninth and Margaret Trautner '20, seeded 14th represented MIT.  Trautner was in the first of three heats. The top two in each heat and the next three fastest times would advance to the final on Saturday.  Unfortunately Trautner's heat went out slow, splitting 67 at the 400.  As the leaders took off, Trautner did not have the sprint speed to go with them.  She was in third until the final 50 when she lost the final qualifying spot, finishing in 2:13.88, finishing 12th overall.  Tregoning was in the second heat, which went out very fast.  The leader came through the 400 in 62.4 while Tregoning was in fourth in 64.5.  She stayed in fourth, finishing in 2:11.25 to qualify to the final.
    
    
                  
    
    Saturday's final day of competition started with the Triple Jump where Shaoul hoped to defend his indoor title.  After his first jump he was sitting in fourth place with his modest 49-1 effort.  Not accustomed to being in fourth in any competition Shaoul took umbridge with this and laid out a 50-7 1/2 performance.  This sealed the deal, although three other jumpers exceeded 50'. Shaoul earned first place, giving MIT 32 points accumulated by just two athletes; Shaoul and Reduker.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up was Liam Ackerman '21, seeded sixth in the Pole Vault.  Ackerman came in at the opening height of 14-7, partly because of the fierce cross wind and partly because up until yesterday he was unable to see very well as one eye was completely swollen shut due to a severe allergic reaction, which also had him sick and suffering from an enormous headache.  The sophomore put it behind him and vaulted clean through 14-7, 15-1, 15-7 and 15-11.  Of the seven vaulters who cleared 15-11, only two were clean and Ackerman was one of them.  Only two cleared the next height and Ackerman beat the other four on misses, giving him an unexpected third place, and MIT 38 points.  This put them in second place at that time.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Tregoning was up in the final of the 800.  The pace was fast so Tregoning was in the back, and still came through in 64.4 in eighth position.  On the backstretch she moved up to seventh and then poured it on in the final hundred to move up to fifth in a season best 2:10.98.  This gave the women five points.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event was the 5K featuring Katie Collins '21, seeded 11th.  The heat was pretty intense in the stadium and the wind pretty strong, so the pace was going to be slow.  The plan was to run about 10 seconds per mile slower than normal, or 5:30 pace.  The first mile went according to plan in 5:31, but Collins had missed going with the top five when they split and settled with the next three.  This pace was too slow at 85 quarter pace and this caused Collins to run a bit awkwardly and wasting energy. With 1000 to go she had run out of gas and fell from seventh to 10th in 17:42.15.
    
    
                  
    
    The men had to wait through the final two events to see if they would remain in second place.  The University of Wisconsin Eau Claire was a runaway winner with 58 points.  Mount Union placed third in the 4x400 to move up to third with 36 points and that sealed the runner-up position for MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    Prior to the competition, at the awards banquet, Jenna Melanson was awarded the Elite 90 award, the programs 12th such honor, by far the most in the country.  The award is given to the individual female and male at that championship  with the highest GPA.  If there is a tie it goes to the one with the  most academic units.  Aidan Gilson, a two-time Elite 90 winner was in the tie-breaker, but lost out on the number of units.  Both Melanson and Gilson have perfect 5.0 GPA's.
    
    
                  
    
    Also winning awards were Yorai Shaoul, honored as the New England Region Male Field Event Athlete of the Year, and Coach Derek Rousseau, winning the New England Region Assistant Coach of the Year award.  Both will be among those considered for the same honors nationally, which will be decided next week.

    In the end, the Men's and Women 's Track & Field teams from MIT did what they were supposed to do at the New England Division III Championship, but they did it a bit better. The men, seeded for 122 points, scored 139.5, 50 points more than runner-up Tufts.  The women, seeded to finish second with 77 points, scored a surprising 101.5, falling just 9.5 short of heavily favored Williams College.  
    
    
                  
    
    Despite the rain on Friday, overall the weather was nice with 60-65 degree temperatures both days with very little wind for a change.  In an age when athletes tend to be much more focused on personal bests or qualifying for the next championship, the rain tends to affect them.  Whereas, MIT, focused more on competing, took advantage of the relatively poor competition to score major points on Friday.  Seeded for 24 points on Friday in the 10K, Hammer, Javelin and Long Jump, the men scored 44 points.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Long Jump, Yorai Shaoul '21 jumped 23-9 1/2 to easily win the event, and Alec Reduker '20, who had only jumped once before ever, and that was three weeks ago, added to his legend by going 23-0 1/2 for second place, giving his team three points more than they were seeded.
    
    
                  
    
    In the throws, Albert Menio '20 stepped up big in the Hammer, throwing a personal best of 161-1 to place sixth after not being seeded to score at all.  Gabe Madonna '20 and Cooper Driscoll '22 both made the finals of the Javelin with Madonna placing as he was seeded, fourth with a throw of 179-4.
    
    
                  
    
    Not having run a 10K all year before last week, the trio of Josh Rosenkranz '19, Finn Jacobson-Schulte '21 and Josh Derrick '20 qualified with last week's effort.  Racing 10K's in back to back weeks is not usually recommended, particularly with mileage as low as Rosenkranz and Derrick were putting in.  However, it was assumed they had run well within their abilities the week before and therefore had plenty left in the tank.  With a relatively weak field, it was assumed no one would be capable of running sub 32:00 other than the MIT runners.  At the gun, Trevor Wysong of Bridgewater State College, a pretty good runner in the past who had not run fast this season, ran a 70 first 400, opening up a pretty good gap.  MIT runners were coached to run 77-78 pace for the first three or four miles if there was no one willing to do so.  Two other runners had good out with Wysong, but it was clear they were coming back.  Would Wysong hold it was the question.  After three successive 5:08 1600's, the three MIT runners started to go after the leader, who by that time was 23 seconds up.  Rosenkranz led the attack with Jacobson right on him.  Derrick fell off after the 5:03 fourth 1600, but not too much.  Their fifth 1600 went down to 5:01 as they were closing the gap and although Derrick was now 11 seconds back, he was still in fifth place.  Rosenkranz and Jacobson were not able to close the gap enough, falling five seconds short as Rosenkranz finished second in 31:40.73 and Jacobson third in 31:42.51.  Derrick remained in fifth in 32:05.09.  After being seeded for one point the 18 point performance gave the Engineers a nice advantage going into day two.
    
    
                  
    
    On Saturday the Engineers were dealt the blow that Aidan Gilson '19, the top seed in the 3K Steeplechase, could not run due to an achilles injury.  With no 4x100 and no one in the Steeplechase or 1500 Tech had to sit on their 44 points until the 110HH.  In the meantime, the Shot Put was underway, an event where MIT could do some damage.  The freshmen really stepped up.  Seeded for 10 points the freshmen came through with 13 points.  Will Woltmann '22, coming off a freak injury, put it together, earning third place with a throw of 49-11 1/4.  Ryan Nall '22 had a huge personal best of 48-4 1/4 to place fourth and Nathan Basinger '22 added to last week's performance by placing seventh at 46-6 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Joa Kennedy '21, over his ankle sprain from two weeks ago, ran an impressive personal best of 15.10 on Friday to advance to the finals in the 110 HH.  In the final, he was less than perfect, but outstanding enough to place fifth in 15.43 after not being seeded to score.
    
    
                  
    
    The points kept piling up for Tech as they scored 10 in the 400 after being seeded for only five.  Benton Wilson '21 ran a personal best of 48.62 to secure third place and Nick Duchatellier '22 also delivered a PR of 49.54 for fifth place.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events the jumpers were adding their own points.  Seeded for 15 points in the High Jump they delivered 18.5.  Alec Reduker '20, who won the event when he cleared 6-8, went for 7-1, but was unable to clear the height.  Chris Washington '20 placed fourth at 6-6 and Caleb Harris '22 cleared 6-4 to tie for fifth.  Shaoul added his second victory, this one in the Triple Jump.  His best mark was 49-5 1/2, getting his team the 10 points for which he was seeded.
    
    
                  
    
    Basinger and Menio again delivered for the throwers when they placed fourth and sixth respectively in the Discus.  Basinger threw a 146-1 PR to earn fourth and Menio threw 144-5.
    
    
                  
    
    Continuing to out perform their seeds, Wilson came back in the 200, earning a victory in a best of 21.56 after only being seeded for eight points.  This puts him at 21st in the country for Division III, not quite good enough to earn a trip to Nationals.  Not seeded to score, Andrew Shao '22 brought home a seventh place for two points in the 400IH, running a personal best 56.75.
    
    
                  
    
    All good things must end, so did  outperforming their seeds.  In the Pole Vault, seeded for 12, the Engineers delivered seven.  Liam Ackerman '21 placed fourth at 14-7 1/2 and Max Hardy '21, not seeded to score, had a great day to deliver seventh place, also at 14-7 1/2.  This trend continued in the 5K.  Steven Goldy '20 was not supposed to score, but delivered a personal best 15:05.17, running an exceptional race to place fifth.  Andrew Mah '22, feeling the effects of a long year, lost focus in the latter stages of the race, falling back to eighth place in 15:11.89. Seeded for eight Tech only managed five points.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT finished their scoring in the 4x800 relay.  Although seeded to score well, MIT was using different personnel than when they ran their seed time, so place was going to be unpredictable.  Aiden Foucault-Etheridge '22, dealing with a leg injury, had missed placing in the 800 out of the slow section by one place with a 1:54.93. However, he was able to deliver a 1:58.5 leadoff leg as his knee was beginning to bother him.  Ellery Rajagopal '21 really delivered, bringing the baton around in 1:57.8, a big personal best to move the team up to a three-way tie for third.  Matt Schofield '22 added a 1:57.2 huge PR to keep the team in the same spot, but closer to second place.  Simon Alford '20, a proven excellent anchor leg, put down a very strong 1:55.8 to bring the team to second place for a cumulative time of 7:49.48.
    
    
                  
    
    The women simply did not have enough weapons with so many illnesses and injuries happening this year.  However, those who did compete did amazingly well.  MIT was not supposed to score any points on Friday, yet they came away with 11.  In the Long Jump, despite a painful back, Yilinn Yang '22 delivered a sixth place performance at a season best 17-8.  Liana Reilly '21 added a surprise point for eighth place, jumping 17-0.
    
    
                  
    
    Ignoring the wet circle, Folusho Jebutu '20 and Elise McCormack-Kuhman '20 finished fifth and sixth respectively in the Hammer.  Jebutu earned a fifth with a throw of 151-0 and McCormack-Kuhman was awarded sixth with her throw of 148-7.
    
    
                  
    
    This boost gave the women a little more hope of possibly catching Williams.  Saturday started with the 10 points for which Jenna Melanson '20 was seeded in the 3K Steeplechase.  The junior took the lead at the start and held it to the finish in 10:56.47.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500, MIT was again not seeded to score points.  However, Margaret Trautner '20 had other plans.  She ran a very smart race after the field came through the 400 in 79, not panicing she moved up gradually.  She ran 72, 71 and struggled a bit in the homestretch, but held onto third place in 4:38.23
    
    
                  
    
    With no one in the 100HH or 400, MIT then turned to Michelle Menkiti '20 in the 100.  Seeded for one point, Menkiti brought home three, placing sixth in a season best 12.36.
    
    
                  
    
    In the High Jump, Reilly returned to competition to tie for fifth place at 5-2 1/4, 1/2 of a point more than she was seeded.
    
    
                  
    
    Bailey Tregoning '19 and Trautner were seeded for 16 points in the 800, which was unlikely with Trautner having fatigue from the 1500. Both ran very smart races, letting the pace go out fast while they were satisfied in the back, coming through the 400 in 66.8.  Tregoning probably waited a little too long to move up towards the front as she was unable to catch the leader, settling for second place with a season best 2:11.29, negatively splitting the race.  Trautner came through big with a 2:13.63 season best for fifth place.
    
    
                  
    
    Menkiti was up again, this time in the 200.  She was not seeded to score, but competed well, charging hard in the final 50 to secure fourth place in a season best 25.36.
    
    
                  
    
    While MIT was doing incredibly well, Williams was also performing well, yet losing ground due to some scratches.  Originally seeded at 45 points more than MIT, the Engineers were knocking that difference down to a point that a strong finish may bring home their seventh consecutive NED3 outdoor title.
    
    
                  
    
    Not seeded to score in the Discus, Jebutu continued to compete at her best.  She threw a season best 123-7 to place fourth, giving Tech five more points.
    
    
                  
    
    Although they were seeded for 19 points in the Triple Jump, that was not realistic, particularly with Yang's back hurting her.  Elena Andree '22, jumping over 38' for the first time last week, repeated that performance, jumping 38-2 for third place.  Lucy Lee '21 and Elizabeth Weeks '21 added a sixth and seventh at 37-5 3/4 and 37-4 1/2 respectively, netting 11 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Katie Collins '21, seeded first in the 5K, did not disappoint.  Going out in 5:22, the sophomore pulled away from the field right at the start.  She slowed a bit for a 5:29 second 1600, but continued to open up her lead.  She fatigued in the final 1600, running alone, but finished in first in 17:18.59.
    
    
                  
    
    At this point, MIT was 15.5 points behind Williams and ready to give it everything to close the gap.  In the 4x800 the Engineers were hoping for a victory and that Williams would not score.  After a solid lead-off of 2:19.4 by Marissa McPhillips '20, Skylar Brooks '20 got the baton in second and looked good at the beginning, splitting 69 even though she had lost two places.  However, fatigue set in and the junior could only manage a 2:30, dropping the team to sixth place when she handed off to a fatigued Trautner.  Trautner fought with everything she had, delivering a 2:16.6 to move the team up to fourth.  Tregoning pulled the team up to third with a 2:14.5, too far out of second to be possible.  Williams managed a seventh, so the lead was now 11.5.  
    
    
                  
    
    Williams was favored to win the 4x400 and MIT was not seeded to score.  Using every available body, MIT put together a competitive relay team, but Menkiti would be running her first ever competitive 400.  Claire Melvin '22, having run the 400IH in 65.82 earlier in the meet, led off with a 60.3.  Sarah Ishamuddin '21 delivered a 59.5 leg and Kristen Frombach '19 a 59.7.  Menkiti anchored the team to a seventh place finish with a 58.5 for a total time of 3:58.17.  Unfortunately, Williams delivered the win to bring the total difference to 19.5.
    
    
                  
    
    Now it was only the Pole Vault remaining.  It would be possible for the Engineers to catch their rival, but would require near perfection on their part as well as the Williams pole vaulters failing to deliver.  When the dust settled, Kari Stromhaug '19 won the event at a season best height of 12-4 3/4.  Lila Wine '21 cleared a personal best 11-6 1/4 for fifth place.  Makenzie Patarino '19, completing her comeback from a serious shoulder injury, brought home a seventh place finish with a 11-0 1/4 performance.  Anais Marenco '22 placed eighth at 11-0 1/4 to give MIT 16 points, not enough even if Williams did not score.  Williams did score, tying for second for seven points and the eventual 9.5 point separation.
    
    
                  
    
    The next stop on the competition schedule will be the NEICAAA Championship, an all division championship hosted by Southern Connecticut State University next Friday and Saturday.

    ### Women Qualify Two More For Nationals                
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 10-11, 2019              
    
    
                  
    
    After pushing the teams through attempting to win two weekends of championship track and field, MIT took a step back to recover for those individuals who had already secured a spot among the top 22 women or top 20 men on the NCAA Division III Championship field.  With only a couple of exceptions, the Engineers only competed those who were still hoping to secure one of those valued spots.  With many championships being contested around the country this weekend and regional NCAA approved Final Qualifying meets next week, unless a student-athlete is ranked among the top eight or so, their place on the list is not likely secure.
    
    
                  
    
    On the first day of competition at the NEICAAA Championship, the pole vaulters were the first to compete.  Due to the threat of rain and the fact that the host college, Southern Connecticut State University, only owned one high jump pit and one pole vault pit, the events were moved inside.  For the men, Liam Ackerman '21 and Scott Cameron '19 were representing MIT.  Ackerman, who was ranked 11th on the national list with a vault of 15-11, was inconsistent in his approach because of his lack of ability to practice full approaches due to shin splints, was able to clear 14-11 1/2, but missed all three attempts at 15-5 1/2, placing sixth in the competition.  Cameron looked very good at 15-5 1/2, but missed at 15-11 1/2, having an inconsistent take-off.  He finished in fifth place.  He had been seeded 29th going into the competition and moved up to 27th with his half inch improvement.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were next and Kari Stromhaug '19, seeded 11th nationally, Anais Marenco '22 and Lila Wine '21 were ready to represent MIT.  Stromhaug placed fifth by clearing 12-2, but did not move up nationally.  Wine cleared 11-2 1/4 and Marenco failed to clear a height.
    
    
                  
    
    At the same time, Liana Reilly '21 was up in the High Jump and Gabe Madonna '20 was about to throw in the Javelin.  Reilly, ranked 43rd nationally with a jump of 5-4 1/4, cleared 5-2 1/4, but just missed matching her previous best.  Madonna, ranked 11th nationally with a throw of 197-6, threw 187-7 to make finals, but tweaked his elbow on his first throw in finals, withdrawing from the competition.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track Benton Wilson '21 was hoping to move up from his rank of 22nd nationally with a 21.56 in the 200.  In the trials, Wilson ran 21.71 to advance to the finals on Saturday.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event for MIT on day one was the women's 5K.  Katie Collins '21 was ranked 19th nationally in the 5K entering the competition.  Getting over an early season illness and also regaining some of her confidence after last week's 17:18, Collins was ready to take advantage of the 60 degree temperature, good competition and no wind.  The initial pace was perfect at 80 seconds, but it sped up from there.  Collins was a little out of her comfort range coming through the 1600 at 5:18, but knew she had to stay with the leaders if possible.  However, she slipped to 82's and the lead pack of four pulled away.  Within a couple of laps the leaders were breaking up.  Collins moved up to fourth as one dropped out and then third after coming through the 3200 in 10:47.  Her final 1600 was a 5:34, but she maintained third place.  She finished with a 40 final 200 to finish in 17:01.24, moving her up to, you guessed it, 11th nationally.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two began with the Men's Discus Throw.  Jon Fakkema '19, who had a very difficult championship last week, got it back together today.  Throwing 154-8 earned him a fifth place.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up for the Engineers was the Men's High Jump.  Chris Washington '20, who had dealt with an injury the entire indoor season and part of the outdoor season was ready to return to his days of flirting with national qualifying jumps. Washington looked great in warm-ups and at the start of competition, clearing 6-3 and 6-5 with no misses.  At 6-7 he could not make it work, narrowly missing on his final attempt.  However, jumping clean through 6-5 earned him third place.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Bailey Tregoning '19 and Margaret Trautner '20 were giving the 800 another try.  Tregoning was already a pretty sure lock with her 2:11.29, but Trautner's 2:13.69 was ranked 20th nationally.  In separate sections, Trautner was up first.  Running 66 high for the first 400, Trautner moved to the front with 250 to go.  She waited too long as she was still going strong at the finish with a 2:13.10 season best section victory, moving her up to 14th nationally.  Tregoning had an opportunity to go for a big time as she had nothing to lose.  Instead she was concerned the first lap would be too fast.  She came through the 400 in 65 in the back of the pack.  She waited to move until about 150 to go when she suddenly came on strong, moving all the way to third place with a season best 2:11.01.  Trautner placed sixth overall.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Men's Shot Put, Will Woltmann '22 had a 53' warm-up throw and that ended his chance at a big day.  He forgot about competing, instead focusing on throwing far.  Although he did throw a season best 50-6 1/4 and placed ninth, he was not competing well.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, Benton Wilson was up for the 200 final.  He had a slow start and was unable to get the time he needed to get to Nationals.  However, he did catch most of the field, placing fourth in 21.73.
    
    
                  
    
    Tech's last event was the Women's Triple Jump.  Lucy Lee '21 and Elizabeth Weeks '21 were both hoping to move up on the national list.  Both had jumped 37-10 this season, but needed to get into the mid 38's.  Lee jumped 37-8 in the trials, but was unable to move up in the finals, finishing in ninth.  Weeks did not have a great day, spraining her ankle and not making it out of the trials.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT will host an NCAA approved Final Qualifier on Thursday evening.  This truly will be the final opportunity to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship.

    ### NEWMAC Win Streak Continues For MIT
    
    
                      
    
    ##### Andree Sets Rookie Triple Jump Record, Shaoul Nearly Gets Long Jump Record
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 27, 2019              
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Men's and Women's Track and Field teams endured 50 degree temperatures and six hours of gusting 25 mph winds to secure their 19th and 11th consecutive NEWMAC Championship titles respectively.  The men rode a strong field event performance to easily outscore their opponents 275 points to 183 for WPI, 107 for Springfield College, 105 for Coast Guard, 50 for Wheaton College and 46 for Babson College.  The depleted women's team won a relatively close battle with Springfield College 182.5 to 152.16.  Following them were Coast Guard at 114, 83.33 for WPI, 81.5 for Wheaton College, 47.5 for Smith College, 47 for Mount Holyoke, 44 for Wellesley, and 28 for Babson College.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's men field event athletes recorded seven out of eight wins and scored 152 of their total 275 points, using the 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 scoring format, and the Engineers were cautious, not competing Will Woltmann '22 in the throws, Alec Reduker '20 in the Long Jump and Steven Speck '20 in the High Jump or Long Jump.  In addition, the NEWMAC Conference rule only allows for up to four entries per team in each event, further hampering the Engineers.  Although he did not record a victory, Jon Fakkema '19 scored the most individual points for Tech with 22, placing second in the Shot Put, second in the Hammer and third in the Discus.  Yorai Shaoul '21 was the only double winner for MIT, taking the Long Jump with a 24-1 3/4 effort (only using three attempts), just 1/2" from tying the MIT record, and then the Triple Jump with a jump of 47-7.  His Long Jump mark ranks third in the country while his Triple Jump mark of 49-9 still ranks first.
    
    
                  
    
    Even without Woltmann, the talented throws group had the most dominant performance in the Shot Put, scoring 26 of a possible 29 points.  Freshman Nate Basinger took advantage of an off day for Fakkema and Woltmann's absence, winning the event with a throw of 46-1 1/2.  After Fakkema's second place, Albert Menio '20 placed fourth and Ryan Nall '22 took sixth place honors.  While they only placed three individuals, Reduker led a 1-2-3 sweep in the High Jump by winning with a 6-6 3/4 effort.  Chris Washington '20 and Caleb Harris '22 earned second and third respectively, both clearing 6-4 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    The only perfect event for MIT was the 10K.  Not having run a 10K yet this season, Josh Derrick '20, Josh Rosenkranz '19, Finn Jacobson-Schulte '21 and Steven Goldy '20 entered the race with no time.  Facing the strongest winds of the day, no one really wanted to take the lead.  However, the MIT runners wanted to extend their season and to do so they had to qualify for next week's 10K by running at least 33:20.  While this is obviously not a very challenging performance, in such strong winds it could be difficult without an organized plan.  Jacobson-Schulte had no interest in waiting, taking the lead once it was clear no one else would, running a 77 second first lap.  While the goal was to qualify and possibly take the top four places it was also desirable to do both while running as slow as possible and 77 pace was too fast.  The quartet quickly settled on 79 pace, leading two additional runners through four consecutive 5:17 1600 splits.  After one more lap, the group could sense some fatigue from the opposing runners and attacked with a couple of 77 second laps to gain separation.  They quickly attained a 100 meter lead and cruised in with a 1-2-3-4 finish, all four running 32:52, led by Josh Derrick's 32:52.55.
    
    
                  
    
    The only other victory for MIT in the running events was earned by Aidan Gilson '19.  After two laps of running with his opponents, despite the wind, Gilson took over in a very determined fashion, dropping a 72 lap.  He then settled into 75 pace to easily win in 9:26.31.
    
    
                  
    
    Back to the field events, Liam Ackerman '21 continued his dominant vaulting by winning the Pole Vault at 15-5.  Scott Cameron '19 came in second, based on misses, also clearing 15-5, an excellent season best.  Everett Brandyberry '21 placed fourth at 14-5 1/4 and Raja Rajcic '20 claimed eighth place.
    
    
                  
    
    Albert Menio '20, who also placed fourth in the Hammer as well as the Shot Put, earned his first victory this season, throwing 143-2 to win the Discus.  The event, severely hampered by the wind, also saw Tech earn third (Fakkema), sixth (Basinger) and seventh (Nall).
    
    
                  
    
    The final win was earned by Gabe Madonna '20 in the Javelin.  The junior took a limited number of throws, but got the job done with a 183-2 performance.  Cooper Driscoll '22 added a fifth place with a 165-2 throw.
    
    
                  
    
    Benton Wilson '21 did not win any events, although he should have claimed the 200, was responsible for three seconds.  First he anchored the second place 4x100 Relay with a very strong finish.  A 10.82 100 final after running 10.81 in the trials gave the sophomore another second place.  In the 200, Wilson pulled away, had a commanding lead and relaxed, getting caught about 15 meters from the finish, running 22.11.
    
    
                  
    
    With seniors accounting for only 48 of the points, knowing who they held out of the meet, and a very strong incoming class of 2023, the men should not be threatened any time soon.
    
    
                  
    
    The women, while only winning by 30 points, were seeded to win by 100.  In part, Springfield College stepped up, scoring 50 points more than seeded, but MIT also scored 26.5 less than predicted, 14 of which were in middle-distance events and 13 in the Long Jump.  The only events in which the Engineers scored more than their seeds were the 100, Pole Vault, Hammer and Shot Put.
    
    
                  
    
    On the positive side, Elena Andree '22 turned around a foul out in the Long Jump with a 38-2 1/4 freshman record to win the Triple Jump, currently ranking 17th in the country for Division III.  Lucy Lee '21 jumped 37-5 for second place, Elizabeth Weeks '21 jumped 36-9 1/2 for fourth place and Yilinn Yang '22, placed seventh at 34-4 3/4, suffering through a painful back injury.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Pole Vault, Kari Stromhaug '19 won the Pole Vault at 12-1 1/2 as she dealt with the gusting cross-wind.  Anais Marenco '22 claimed third, clearing 11-1 3/4.  Emily Caragay '22 also cleared 11-1 3/4, a season best for fourth place, and Jacqueline Ahrens '21 took fifth by clearing 10-8.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Hammer Throw and Shot Put, Folusho Jebutu '20, Elise McCormack-Kuhman '21, Tema Nwana '21 and Lily Papalia '22 combined to earn six more points than their seeds.  Jebutu placed second in the Hammer (145-10) while also placing seventh in the Shot Put (33-11 1/4).  McCormack-Kuhman placed fourth in the Hammer (143-10) despite dealing with a back injury and Nwana threw a personal best 135-6 for sixth place.  Papalia placed sixth in the Shot Put at 35-9 1/4 with an MIT best.
    
    
                  
    
    The remaining victories came in the running events.  Claire Melvin '22 showed her competitiveness when despite stuttering on nine of the ten hurdles in the 400IH, she fought back to steal the victory just before the finish line, running 1:07.39.  Jenna Melanson '20 took the Steeplechase out at the gun, ignoring the wind, led from start to finish with a 10:49.08 victory.  In the 1500, Margaret Trautner '20 also took the lead at the gun, hoping to be able to run fast enough to get into the fast section at next week's New England Division III Championship.  However, the strong wind was too much for her.  Once she realized she was not going to run a solid time, the junior eased off the gas, still winning by 11 seconds in 4:43.47.  Later in the meet, Trautner joined Bailey Tregoning '19 for a 1-2 finish in the 800.  After a wind-driven 71 second first 400, Tregoning took off with 300 to go, accelerating into the teeth of the wind to easily win in 2:16.03.  Trautner made a later, but equally effective move to run 2:19.02 for second.  The duo joined with Melvin and Kristen Frombach '19 to win the 4x400 in 4:01.73.  Melvin led off with a solid 60.1.  Trautner added a 60.8, Frombach a 61.5 and Tregoning a 59.4 for the victory.
    
    
                
    
    The injured and depleted women's team will have a very difficult time winning their seventh straight New England Division III Championship next week, particularly against Williams College on their home track.  The men, going for their sixth consecutive New England Division III Championship will be challenged for sure, but hope to be able to pull it off.

    ### Reduker First at MIT to Clear 7' in High Jump
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 6, 2019              
    
    
                  
    
    MIT hosted the Bates, MIT, RPI, Tufts quadrangular meet on a spectacular April day.  The temperature was in the mid-60's with sun shining all day.  The wind was nearly non-existent at the start of the day, but picked up to an average of 2.5+ meters per second by the middle of the meet.
    
    
                  
    
    The NCAA manipulated the scoring system for four or fewer teams quite a few years ago to prevent teams from getting blown out by outrageous scores.  The default scoring system is for each team to score no more than two places regardless of the places actually earned.  For the meet at hand, a quadrangular meet, the point distribution would be 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1. The alternative scoring system would be for only 5-3-2-1 points, but with no limit as to how many could score per team.  The coaches by majority chose the default method of scoring.  At the end of it all, MIT's men won their meet 190.5 to 185 for Tufts, 150.5 for RPI and 125 for Bates.  Tufts women pulled out the victory with 198 points to 194 for MIT, 138 for RPI and 134 for Bates.  If the alternative method of scoring had been chosen, MIT's quality depth for the women would have netted a victory with 75 points to 63 for Tufts, 41 for Bates and 28 for RPI.  The men's order of finish would not have changed.
    
    
                  
    
    While the score went back and forth throughout the meet between MIT and Tufts for both genders, it was nearly impossible for the coaches to keep up with as it was not obvious who was scoring due to the fact that only two could score per team in any given event.  This unpredictability in the score and because the Engineers were down in strength due to injuries and illnesses (only one competitor in the Javelin, High Jump, and 5K for the women), which cost them a minimum of three points, the focus was more on performance.
    
    
                  
    
    The overall top performance in the meet was turned in by Alec Reduker '20, who cleared 7-0 1/4 to easily win the High Jump and tie for the top mark in all of Division III.  This is certainly a national qualifying mark, but also an MIT record.  Not only did Reduker dominate the High Jump, but in his first collegiate competition in the Long Jump the junior landed a 22-9 3/4 performance for second place behind teammate Yorai Shaoul's PR of 23-10 1/4, possibly enough to get him into the NCAA Division III Championship, currently ranked third.  Shaoul also won the Triple Jump with a 48-8 1/4 performance.  His  49-9 from last week still leads the country.  In the High Jump, Reduker was supported by a 6-6 3/4 effort by Caleb Harris '22, who just made it on the MIT top 10 all-time list.
    
    
                  
    
    Sticking with the men's side of the meet, the throwers continued their dominance, although the other teams certainly showed Tech they were not intimidated.  Jon Fakkema '19 continued to lead the MIT throws group by winning the Discus (157-4), placing second in the Hammer (166-9) and earning fourth in the Shot Put with an off-day 45-5 put.  
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Aidan Gilson '19 showed his array of skills as he won the Steeplechase in an impressive 9:14.65, which currently ranks number six in the country for Division III, came back to place fourth in the 400IH in 59.88 and finished with a 51.3 4x400 leg to help lead his team to victory in 3:24.43.
    
    
                  
    
    Benton Wilson '21 made his presence felt, competing in four events, winning all but one of them.  His day began while anchoring the 4x100, proceeded to the 400, then the 200, culminating with anchoring the 4x400.  In the 4x100, Alex Liu '22 got MIT out to a lead, which was maintained by Nick Duchatellier '22.  However, Sope Eweje '19 left early, causing him to slow dramatically to receive the baton, losing the lead.  Wilson did his best to make up the difference but was unable to do so.  In the open 400 Wilson easily pulled away to win with a 49.25.  The 200 was even more impressive as the sophomore ran 21.72, currently the 14th time in the country.  In the 4x400, Gilson and then Kent Slaney '21 (51.8) maintained a close second to Tufts after Duchatellier opened with a 51.6 and that is all Wilson needed.  He anchored with a 49.7 to open up a large lead on the homestretch.
    
    
                  
    
    Two introductory performances deserve mention.  Cooper Driscoll '22 competed in his first MIT track and field competition, placing sixth in the Javelin with a 170-2 performance.  Dylan Doblar '21, injured since the summer, competed for the first time, running 4:03.27 in the 1500 to place eighth.
    
    
                  
    
    While the time was not spectacular, Andrew Mah '22 ran an excellent 5K.  At the peak of the wind there were two sections of the men's 5K with 40 total runners. Mah, running in the faster section ran a very smart race, tucking in, letting others do the work even though it was not particularly fast with 1600 splits of 4:48, 4:54 and 4:47.  The one mistake was taking the lead with 300 to go, meaning the first 100 in the lead was dead into the wind.  Taking the lead with either 600 to go or 200 to go would have been much smarter.  Regardless the final 600 was 1:39 with the final 200 being 30 seconds.  Mah lost by one hundredth of a second to John Reed '21 of RPI 14:59.54 to 14:59.55.
    
    
                  
    
    Jenna Melanson '20 had the top performance of the meet for the women, although there were quite a few on this great spring day.  Melanson perhaps went out a little too hard in the 3000 Steeplechase with a first lap in 82.  Her lead was never in doubt so she was going for a fast time.  After 1200 she slowed to an 87 then an 88, a 90 and a 91 before closing well in 44 to finish in 10:52.22, the third time in all of Division III at this time.  Similar to Gilson, the junior came back in the 400IH, placing fourth in 69.29.
    
    
                  
    
    Bailey Tregoning '19 was mindful not to take the lead too early in the 800, but at the end of a slowing 67 first 400 she could not take the pace any longer.  Taking the lead she seemed to have no trouble running into the wind on the backstretch.  Coming off the final turn she held on well to run a surprising 2:12.86, currently number four in the country.
    
    
                  
    
    Michelle Menkiti '20, still rounding into shape after her hamstring injury, claimed victories in the 100, 200 and anchored the winning 4x100 Relay.  Her winning 100 time was 12.43 and her 200 performance a 25.81.  The 4x100 quartet of Elena Andree '22, Sarah Ishamuddin '21, Joanna Kennedy '22 and Menkiti pulled away more as the race progressed, winning in 49.85.
    
    
                  
    
    Lucy Lee '21 had a great day, winning the Triple Jump with a very strong 37-10, good for #13 on the national list and number three on the MIT all-time list.  She backed that up with a 100HH PR of 15.77, placing third in that event.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Pole Vault, Kari Stromhaug '19 continued her great vaulting, winning by clearing 11-9 3/4.  Makenzie Patarino '19, out the entire indoor season due to shoulder issues, competed for the first time this year, clearing 10-6 and placing third overall.
    
    
                  
    
    Losing Margaret Redfield '21 to appendicitis two days before, Lianna Reilly '21 was on her own representing MIT in the High Jump.  The sophomore, fighting lower back problems, placed second with a jump of 5-3.
    
    
                  
    
    Claire Melvin '22 played a role in the remaining victory by the Engineers.  She won the 400IH with a dramatic come-from-behind victory 66.17 to 66.20.  The freshman then led off the 4x400 Relay with a 60.3 leg.  Marissa McPhillips '20, who had placed third in the 1500 earlier, ran a 61.7 leg.  Kristen Frombach '19, coming back from the 400, 200 double, ran a 62.0 leg. Tregoning, coming back from the 800 had a lot of ground to try and make up, and even though she ran a 58.0 anchor, it was not enough to do better than second place in 4:02.36.
    
    
                
    
    Next week the Engineers are at home in a dual meet versus Williams College.

    ### Field Event Athletes Lead the Way for MIT

    On a wind swept day, MIT's men's and women's teams split time between Princeton New Jersey and their final home meet of the regular season at the Sean Collier Invitational.  With a few of the team's top distance runners preparing for Princeton's Larry Ellis Distance Carnival later this evening, the day began a few minutes before 11 AM back in Cambridge, when the team gathered to recognize our 12 graduating seniors for their hard work and dedication to the program. 
    
    
                  
    
    With rain early, and windy conditions the entire day, weather would play a significant factor throughout the meet. However, despite adverse conditions that forced the pole vault and high jump indoors, the jumping events took center stage for the Engineers, netting several event wins, seasonal or career bests and even a likely national qualifier in the process.  In the horizontal jumps, Junior Steven Speck started off the day, taking first place in the long jump. His performance of 6.41 meters (21'0") was not as good as the previous week where he jumped 21'4" against Williams, but it was more than enough to claim his first collegiate victory. Once the boards were switched over to the Triple Jump, freshman George Stultz kept the momentum going for the Engineers, leading from wire to wire to claim his first collegiate win with a career best of 13.22 meters (43'4 ½"). While Stultz set that mark on his fifth attempt, he captured the lead on his first jump and steadily increased pressure on the rest of the field, improving nearly every round and eventually winning by 14" over his nearest competitor. 
    
    
                  
    
    Meanwhile indoors, junior Chris Washington was on a mission to punch his ticket to next month's national championship. Coming in at 1.90, Chris' only competition came from volunteer coach Max Maritato, who battled with him up to 1.95.  Washington went on to clear 2.00 (6'6 ¾") for the first time since last spring, and set the bar at 2.07. Ultimately, he would fall just short, subtly dislodging the bar on his final attempt.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's jumping events were bolstered by three career best performances and a national qualifying mark.  Sophomore Liana Reilly, who had been battling injury throughout the year, kicked things off in the high jump, finishing in a two-way tie for second place, and clearing a collegiate best mark of 1.63 meters (5'4 ¼"). Less than 10 minutes later, it was outside to the elements, where Reilly would claim her second collegiate best of the day (17'0 ½") in the long jump to finish eighth overall. After wiping out in the 100 Hurdles, sophomore Elizabeth Weeks was on a mission for redemption in the triple jump.  Weeks set the standard on her first jump, posting a collegiate best 11.53 (37'10") for a lead that would be challenged, but never bested the rest of the event. In the Pole Vault Kari Stromhaug led all collegiate competitors, placing second with a jump of 3.75 meters (12'3 ½"). The mark represented her third best jump of the year and moved her into a six-way tie for 11th nationally with a mark that has traditionally been a national qualifier. Finishing right behind Stromhaug was freshman Anais Marenco, taking third with a jump of 3.55m (11' 7 ¾"). 
    
    
                  
    
    In the throwing events, junior Folusho Jebutu had a strong outing, winning the discus with a toss of 36.32m (119' 2"), placing third in the hammer, and seventh in the shot put.  On the men's side, freshmen Gabe Madonna and Cooper Driscoll took second and third in the javelin respectively with throws of 52.11m (170'11") and 50.82m (186'9").  In the weight events, the men's group placed at least three in each of the throwing event finals. Of note, Freshman Nate Basinger had a strong day, throwing a collegiate best in both the shot put (14.24m, 46'8 ¾") and discus (43.15m, 141'7"), placing sixth and eighth overall. Albert Menio '20 also threw a two-meter lifetime best in the discus of 46.01m (150' 11") finishing 4th overall. 
    
    
                  
    
    Trackside, sophomore Gabrielle Enns kicked off the meet in the running events in quick fashion.  Racing largely unopposed in the 3,000 Steeplechase Enns raced to a three second collegiate best in the wind and rain to finish in 12:06.37, nearly two minutes ahead of the rest of the field.
    
    
                  
    
    Freshman Claire Melvin proved consistency is critical to success. For the fourth week in a row, the 400 hurdler  ran a 1:06, rattling off her third straight victory in the event, a trend she will look to extend into next week's NEWMAC Championship. In the 1,500 Katie Bacher '20 made her return to the track after being sidelined early in the winter with injury, finishing second in a time of 5:01.99.
    
    
                  
    
    In the men's 5,000 Dennis Maloney '20, David Walter 'G, and Finn Jacobson-Schulte '21 worked together to battle off some horrific winds to sweep the top three spots with Josh Derrick '20 finishing  just a few seconds back in fifth. The 800 also saw a near sweep, as Simon Alford '20, Aiden Foucault-Etheridge '22, and Ellery Rajagopal '21 finished second, third, and fourth. 
    
    
                  
    
    With the 2019 regular season officially behind us, it is now time to begin a tradition nearly as old as New England itself.  Starting next Saturday, with NEWMAC's, the teams will participate in three straight championships, before taking a week off to either prepare or chase down final qualifying marks for the National Championship. Forget March Madness, welcome to May-hem.

    ### Fakkema, Shaoul Have Dominant Performances on UCSD Collegiate Open
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    March 30, 2019              
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Track and Field teams traveled to Claremont, California for a week of warm weather training during MIT's Spring Break week. This was an opportunity to train the technical groups (throwers, jumpers, vaulters, sprinters and hurdlers) in warm weather and to bond as a team. 
    
    
                  
    
    The practices were challenging and successful thanks to the hospitality of the coaches and staff at Claremont-Mudd-Scripps.  The bonding opportunities consisted of doing pretty much everything together during the week, a beach trip, a game of assassins, hiking and an excellent dinner hosted by parents. The week of training ended with the UC San Diego California Collegiate Open to open the season. Competing with just technical & sprint event athletes, the men placed fourth among 13 teams with 80 points and the women finished eighth among 13 teams with 36 points. 
    
    
                  
    
    The first event of the day on the track was the 4x100 relay, the women's quartet of Elena Andree '22, Sarah Ishamuddin '21, Yilinn Yang '22 and Michelle Menkiti '20 did pretty well for only having two weeks of handoff practices, but there is certainly room for improvement. Their 49.29 was competitive for this time of year, placing fourth and out pacing other New England schools such as Williams and Middlebury. 
    
    
                  
    
    Nick Duchatellier '22 was up next in the 400m. His first 200m was way too fast running 22.7 so even though he was in second place going into the final 200m, he faded badly to fifth place with a time of 50.31.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Pole Vault competition, Kari Stromhaug '19 started where she left off Indoors as the third place finisher at Nationals, opening the outdoor season with a height of 12-1 1/2 to place second. Anais Marenco '22 cleared 11-1 3/4 to tie for seventh place. On the men's side Scott Cameron '19 placed fourth, clearing 14-7 ¼, nearly getting 15-1. Liam Ackerman took sixth with 14-1 ¼ while Everett Brandyberry '21 placed eighth clearing the same height. This was Brandyberry's first time breaking 14 all year at a meet. 
    
    
                  
    
    Yorai Shaoul '21 had quite the opening day in the jumping events. He finished second in the Long Jump at 23 and then took second place again in the Triple Jump in 49-9, which he jumped on his sixth and final attempt in finals. 
    
    
                  
    
    In the High Jump Alec Reduker '20 placed second with a jump of 6-5, although scoring eight points for the Engineers, Alec looks to get on track during his next few meets after a disappointing NCAA indoor Championship.  Margaret Redfield '21 finished tied for seventh in the High Jump with a mark of 5-2 ¼. 
    
    
                  
    
    Yilinn Yang started her outdoor season well with a PR of 37-5 in Triple Jump, with her first jump in finals. She ultimately finished fourth in the competition. The triple jumpers dominated as they have all season. Lucy Lee '21, placed sixth with a PR at 37-0 ¼, while Elena Andree placed seventh in the Triple Jump at 36-8 ¼. 
    
    
                  
    
    Joa Kennedy '21, took a break from decathlon training to compete in both the 110HH and 400IH. Kennedy got out well in the high hurdles to place fourth with a PR of 15.55. While in the 400IH, he raced from the slow section, took control of the race from the beginning, leading the entire way finishing seventh overall with a time of 57.04. Claire Melvin '22 finished eighth in the 400IH in her first collegiate intermediate hurdle race and first race at 400IH in three years. 
    
    
                  
    
    Benton Wilson '21 started the season well, placing fifth in the 100m in 11.10 and fourth in the 200m with a time of 22.14 even though he did not accelerate well the first 50m of his 200m.
    
    
                  
    
    Leading the way for the throws, Jon Fakkema '19 competed well in all three throwing events Shot Put, Discus, and Hammer. Fakkema finished second place in Shot Put with a PR of 50-0, in the Discus he finished third with a throw of 154-8, and in the Hammer he threw 169-7 to finish fifth in the event. While Will Woltmann '22 and Ryan Nall '22 finished fourth and eighth respectively in Shot Put with marks of 48-11 and 45-8 ½.  
    
    
                  
    
    Folusho Jebutu '21 finished sixth in both the Discus and Hammer. Her performance in the Discus was 122-7 and she had a PR in Hammer with a mark of 151-9. 
    
    
                  
    
    In summary, this year's Spring Trip resulted in numerous personal and season's bests.    
    
                    Next week the Engineers are back home as a full team hosting a quad meet against Bates, RPI and Tufts. They will look to improve on their performances in order to be successful against the teams in New England during the Outdoor season.

    ### Throwers Dominate For Engineers
    
    
                      
    
    ##### MIT Men, Williams Women Win Dual Meet
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 13, 2019              
    
    
                  
    
    In this age of chasing performances around the region and country to qualify for the various championships, MIT and Williams, historically the two best Division III track and field teams in New England over the past 40 years competed in an old-fashioned dual meet.  Williams women, 2019 indoor national champions, were too much for the injured and ill Engineers, winning by a score of 108 to 76.  MIT's men, fresh off a New England championship and finishing seventh at the NCAA Division III Indoor Track & Field championship, won 113 to 86.
    
    
                  
    
    For both genders, MIT's throwers were the dominant story for the home team.  They certainly took advantage of the 80 degree, sunny day.  For the men, Jon Fakkema '19, Albert Menio '20, Will Woltmann '22, Ryan Nall '22, Nathan Basinger '22, Gabe Madonna '20 and Cooper Driscoll '22 scored every point available to them in the competition, outscoring Williams 41-3, giving up the three because MIT only had two javelin throwers.  The first throwing event was the Discus, and Fakkema continued his very impressive senior year, winning with a throw of 149-1. Menio earned second with a personal best of 144-3, Basinger was third with 135-11 and Nall was fourth with a throw of 131-10.  Next was the Hammer Throw and Fakkema again dominated, winning with a 167-4 throw.  Menio threw another PR, this one 160-0 for second place.  Nall earned third and Woltmann fourth with throws of 154-5 and 138-7 respectively.  The five throwers made their way over to the Shot Put venue, but little else changed.  Woltmann won with a season and outdoor best of 49-1.  Fakkema was a close second at 47-1, Basinger third at 44-8 and Menio fourth at 42-7.  While these events were being contested, Madonna and Driscoll were taking care of business in the Javelin Throw.  Madonna, a junior, was competing in his first meet ever at MIT simply because it was his first year on the team.  A 150' thrower in high school, the two years off seemed to serve him well.  He proceeded to throw 197-6, the number five throw all-time for MIT.  The mark ranks him fifth in New England and ninth in the country for Division III.  This earned him first place, which Driscoll supported with second place at 158-11 despite an ailing shoulder.
    
    
                  
    
    The women dominated in similar fashion.  In the Hammer the women swept with Elise McCormack-Kuhman '20 winning with a 155-0 PR.  Folusho Jebutu '20 took second with a 139-11 throw and Savannah Inglin '20 and Tema Nwana '21 added third and fourth with marks of 122-0 and 114-7 respectively.  In the Shot Put, Lily Papalia '22 and Jebutu took first and second with marks of 35-0 1/2 and 34-1 1/4.  In the Discus, Jebutu won with a mark of 120-10.  Papalia and Inglin added a third and fourth at 94-7 and 75-3.  McCormack-Kuhman took second place honors in the Javelin with a mark of 89-0.  All in all, the women throwers scored 30 of MIT's 76 points in just four events.
    
    
                  
    
    There were many other highlights accomplished by MIT athletes.  Liam Ackerman '21 returned to his All America form by clearing 15-11 in the Pole Vault to win that event. Supporting that, Raja Rajcic '20 cleared a season best of 14-5 1/4 for third place.  Chris Washington '20 returned to competition for the first time this year, clearing 6-4 1/2 to win the High Jump.  Alec Reduker '20 took the weekend off after clearing 7-0 last week.  Steven Speck '20, who took second place honors in the High Jump, popped a big PR in the Long Jump, placing second with a jump of 21-4 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Benton Wilson '21 continued his winning ways.  He first won the 100 in a season best 10.99 and then won the 200 in another season best of 21.71.  On either end of those events Wilson anchored both the winning 4x100 (Alex Liu '22, Nick Duchatellier '22, Sope Eweje '19) in 43.78 and the winning 4x400 (Reed Foster '22, Simon Alford '20, Kent Slaney '21).
    
    
                  
    
    The other victories for the men were earned by Aidan Gilson '19, who took first in the 3,000 Steeplechase and Andrew Shao '22 in the 400IH.  The senior trailed for a little over 800 meters in the steeplechase before deciding the pace was too slow.  He finished strong with a 9:33.73.  He returned in the 400IH, placing second in a personal best 57.16 to support the victory by Shao  in 56.99.
    
    
                  
    
    The women claimed three victories outside of the throws.  Bailey Tregoning '19 ran a 2:12.65 after coming through the 400 in 68.  Given the gusting wind, most races became strategic and this was no exception.  Margaret Trautner '20 and Marissa McPhillips '20 added a second and fourth place with a 2:16.15 and 2:16.69.  Claire Melvin '22 took the victory in the 400IH, running 66.25, and Katie Collins '21 won the 5K from start to finish in 17:45.41.
    
    
                  
    
    Although there was not a victory for MIT, Lucy Lee '21, Elizabeth Weeks '21 and Elena Andree '22 had a solid triple jump outing, jumping 37-4 1/2, 36-9 3/4 and 36-6 3/4 to place second, third and fourth.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, some of MIT elite middle-distance, distance runners will travel to Princeton for the Larry Ellis Invitational while others will compete at home in the Sean Collier Invitational.
