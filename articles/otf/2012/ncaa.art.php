              <p align="left">May 24-26, 2012</p>
              <p align="left">MIT sent seven men and seven women qualifiers to the <a href="ncaa.res.php">NCAA Division III Championship</a>, hosted by Claremont-McKenna-Scripps in Claremont, CA. This is a remarkable number of qualifiers given the challenge of making the championship field. In order to qualify an individual had to be top 20 in the country on the men's list or top 22 on the women's list. For a relay team to qualify they had to be among the top 16 teams in the country. Track and Field at the Division III level is exploding with talent in recent years and this is by far the best year yet. While getting to Nationals is extremely difficult, with trial rounds in all running events with the exception of the 5K and 10K and with no one wanting to lead in the distance events, most events from the 1500 up tend to be very strategic, making it even more challenging to make the finals in these events.</p>
              <p align="left">This year, like many years, the National Championship is the same week as MIT final exams. MIT left campus late Tuesday, the second day of exams. Many athletes had their exams moved to early in the week and others would have them proctored while at the NCAA Division III Championship. All three times MIT has been among the top four teams in the country at the outdoor championship, the exams were completed the week before Nationals, giving the athletes an opportunity to focus on track &amp; field and nothing else.</p>
              <p align="left">The athletes disregarded their fatigue and competed like they always do. Some even raising the bar competitively if not in overall performance due to strategic efforts by their opponents. The first day was a very busy day for MIT. First up was the Women's 4x100 Relay. MIT was ranked 13th out of the 16 teams, but thought if they could extend the handoffs deeper into the first half of each zone and get the speed out of injured athlete, Jackie Brew '14, they could make the finals. Brew ran well, as did Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12 and Portia Jones '12, and the handoffs were there, but the quality of the field was just too much for MIT. There time was 47.83, their second fastest time of the year, but not enough to make it to finals. </p>
              <p align="left">Next up for Tech was the Men's 1500. Both Ben Mattocks '12 and Kyle Hannon '13 were in the field. Hannon was up first, and with by far the most experience of the two, knew what he had to do to make finals. However, the uncompetitive Hannon showed up and fell out the back shortly after a nice first 400, which was set up well at 61 seconds. From there he continued to drop, eventually finishing last in 4:18. Mattocks has done a tremendous job of competing the past month, dropping 10 seconds off his previous PR of 4:00. Similar to the first section, the first quarter was out in 61 seconds. Mattocks stayed in it, positioning himself well through splits of 2:04 and 3:08. Mattocks finished at 3:54.13 to make it to the finals.</p>
              <p align="left">Simmons was up for her second race of the day, the 400IH. She had a great start and her primary challenge, that of not picking up the hurdle visually soon enough to adjust her stride, seemed to be in check. At hurdle five she stuttered a bit, but came on strong on the homestretch. At hurdle 10 she took 10 stutter steps, nearly stopping, but she regained the lead, winning her section at 61.16.</p>
              <p align="left">Jones was next, representing MIT in the 200, an event in which she placed fifth in 2011. Her start seemed a bit delayed, possibly because the race was started while the announcer was giving the lineup. Nevertheless she had too much time to makeup and finished in 24.74, not enough to make finals.</p>
              <p align="left">The first finals for MIT were the 10K races where Tech had Elaine McVay '15 in the women's race and Dan Harper '12 representing the men. For both it would be the first time at outdoor nationals. McVay went with the leaders, demonstrating her usual &quot;no fear of dying&quot; strategy. The first 1600 was a crisp 5:42. She stayed up front for the second mile, coming through in 11:28. McVay started falling back a little in the third mile, slowing to 88 second pace, while her third 1600 was in 5:50. Making the early move to go with the eventual winner hit her hard as her final three 1600 splits were 6:01, 6:08 and 6:04. Her final time of 37:00.15 was far off her best, but her 11th place finish was better than she was seeded, showing how hard she raced. Harper, running with no fear all season, even finishing second at the IC4A Championship in 30:07, was seeded 11th coming into the race, but thought he could win. At the beginning of the race, his inexperience showed as he reacted to every move made during the first 1600, which was a pedestrian 5:00. The second mile picked up a bit but Harper did not respond well, appearing to doubt himself for the first time this season, he only ran a 4:55 second 1600, hanging back around eighth place. The third mile picked up some more as the pack moved to cover a breakaway, but Harper only ran 4:53, giving up on trying to win. In the final three miles, Harper would come alive for a few strides then fall back to 5:00 pace. He finally moved in the final 400, closing in 67, but was unable to gain All America status as he placed ninth in 31:08.02. </p>
              <p align="left">Stephen Serene '12, nearly as much a surprise this season as Mattocks, needed to finish among the top five in his heat or one of the next four fastest times. The pace was pretty quick for the first 1600, but nothing too fast, coming through in 4:52. The next two laps slowed but Serene took charge at the end, closing in 74 and 35 for the final 600 meters to finish in fourth, qualifying automatically for the finals.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event of day one for MIT was the Women's 4x400 relay, the third event of the day for Jones and Simmons. MIT was again seeded 13th of the 16 teams, but knew they could run faster. Simmons got things started with a 55.8 leadoff to put MIT well in the lead in their heat. Gross, as can be expected at Nationals, put together a 57.6 leg to put MIT in a strong second place. Brew, despite not being able to practice well for the past month and a half ran a strong 58.0. Jones ran a well paced, strong 55.9 to bring MIT home in third place in a season best of 3:47.22, advancing to the finals with the fourth best time overall.</p>
              <p align="left">Day two began with the Men's Hammer Throw. CK Umachi '12 was seeded 15th and not given much chance to get into the nine man final. The first flight had three good throws, but most competitors threw less than expected. Umachi was in the second of two flights. On his first throw he got a good release. The hammer landed with no room to spare on the left sector line and was an eight foot PR of 194-5. This put Umachi in fourth place at the time. As the flight progressed he slipped to seventh place. On his first throw in the finals he fell out the front as he watched the release, and that may have been a better throw. However, no one passed him and he scored the first points for MIT, earning his second All America award in his career.</p>
              <p align="left">Later in the day, Jones was up in the 100HH, an event she was second in last year. Throughout the year Jones paid less attention to the details of hurdle drills and often cut hurdle workouts short. The effects of that were less than desirable outcomes in the hurdle races throughout the season. With a poor start and hitting the first hurdle, she was visibly frustrated. While she did not give up, she was too far behind to make up the ground. Her time in the trials was 14.49, not nearly enough to make the finals.</p>
              <p align="left">The final competitor of the day for MIT was Pat Marx '13 in the 800. Marx was seeded pretty far down the list, and again, not expected to make the finals, but there was no question he had the ability if the race broke correctly for him. The start was clean and the pace right, coming through the 400 in 54.7. Early in the first 400 he positioned himself well, but then fell into his old habits of getting on the rail and not leaving himself any room to move out should someone come up on him. Of course, he got boxed in and had to wait until near the 500 mark to get around. Trying to move up out of the back against the wind and fighting all of the elbows was too much for Marx. He ran a solid race but did not advance as his 1:52.68 was not quite fast enough.</p>
              <p align="left">The final day of competition began with the Women's Pole Vault. Lauren Kuntz '13 was representing MIT in the event she had placed fourth in the year before with a PR of 12-7 1/4. She had vaulted 12-1 1/2 many times this year, but no higher. She cleared 12-5 1/2 and was one of nine competitors remaining to attempt 12-7 1/4. She was in seventh place going into the new height, but was unable to clear it and the two competitors behind her on misses made the height, giving Kuntz a ninth place finish, one place out of All America honors.</p>
              <p align="left">While the Pole Vault was going on, Serene was up in the Steeplechase. For a first timer to make it to finals was exceptional and Serene was determined to make it to the awards stand. The pace was slower than the trials at the start, but by the 1600 mark was 4:50, two seconds ahead. Serene fell off the torrid pace of the leaders, running in contention for eighth place, six seconds ahead of the trials pace at the 2400 meter mark. Moving hard Serene was unable to catch eighth place, even though he ran a 9:09.23 time, by far his second best ever.</p>
              <p align="left">Mattocks was up next for MIT, another first timer, who ran amazingly well to make it to the finals, already surpassing his seed. At the start of the race it was apparent no one wanted to take the lead. The pedestrian pace was 65 for the first 400 and a ridiculous 2:14 for the 800. Since Mattocks was much more of a distance runner coming down to race the 1500, having never broken 2:00 in the 800, he knew he was in trouble. The pace jumped quickly and he did his best to go with them, running 61 for the third quarter and 44 seconds for the final 300 was not even close to the speed of the others in the race. Mattocks 1:45 pace for the final 700 meters still had him finish last in 4:00.57, ending a remarkable month of May in his senior year.</p>
              <p align="left">The Men's Pole Vault was next for the Engineers. Nathan Peterson '12, a two time indoor All American, who had not made the outdoor field of participants until this year, knew he was going to earn All America status. Peterson was tied for seventh seed at 16-5, a mark that would certainly make All America if achieved. Peterson cleared 15-11 on his first attempt after passing the first two heights. However, at 16-2 he was unable to make the height, giving him a tie for ninth, the third ninth place finish for the Engineers on the this day and fourth so far in the championship.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 400IH, Simmons would be racing her final individual race for MIT. Placing second as a sophomore and fourth as a junior, Simmons was determined to win this year. She got out very well and did not stutter any hurdles until number five. She had a very strong final turn, taking the lead as she entered the home stretch. Going in the last two hurdles she stuttered quite a bit, but maintained the lead. As she approached the finish line it appeared she would win the elusive individual title, but with less than a meter to go she was passed on the outside. Her new MIT record of 60.36 earned her another NCAA Division III runner-up award.</p>
              <p align="left">Tilly Taylor '15 was entered in the Javelin, seeded 11th. She had some solid throws, but her best was only 133-2, not enough to make it to finals. Taylor's shoulder had been bothering her during the week and likely affected her performance.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event for MIT was the Women's 4x400. Simmons had not had adequate time to cool-down after the 400IH race as she was called to the awards stand to receive her award. Either Simmons or Coach Halston Taylor should have pulled the plug on the awards presentation, delaying it until later, as Simmons sat for nearly 20 minutes while she waited on the poorly organized awards group. This definitely had an affect on her performance in the 4x400. Simmons is always capable of delivering a 55 second leadoff, but her fatigue from the 400IH and lack of cooldown prevented her from doing better than a 57.3. However, Gross stepped up and delivered a very competitive 56.8 to put MIT in fourth place. Brew maintained MIT's position throughout the first 300 meters, then lost one position on the homestretch, running a very respectable 58.3. Jones went out with a strong sense of urgency, smoking the first 200, bringing MIT back to third place by the 200 mark and looking as though she may have a chance at second. However, when she hit the 300 mark she began dying and at 350 really locked up. She maintained a hold on fifth place up to the finish when after two more teams passed her she prematurely put on the brakes a meter before the finish line. At that point one more team passed her, putting MIT in eighth place in 3:48.77. Jones ran a 56.2 leg, a fine leg, but not running through the finish cost MIT at least one place.</p>
              <p align="left">Overall, MIT's performances were strong and placed MIT higher than they were seeded in nearly every event. Unfortunately this did not translate into many points. The women finished in a tie for 26th with nine points. The men finished in a tie for 68th with two points. The 2012 season was a tremendous success with both teams winning the NEWMAC Conference Championshp and the men winning the New England Division III Championship with the women claiming second, but somehow it seems these championships were a disappointment and put an unpleasant cap on an otherwise very satisfying year. Perhaps the level of success for the women, achieving a third and fourth place finish at these championships the past two years had expectations too high. Of the 14 qualifiers, eight are seniors, three are juniors, one a sophomore and two are freshmen. Many just missed making the National Championship, so hopefully MIT will be back with a large group in 2013.</p>
