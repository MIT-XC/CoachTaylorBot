              <p><span style="font-size: 18px">MIT Takes USTFCCCA Deb Vercauteren Program of the Year Award</span></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left">May 21-23, 2015</p>
              <p align="left">The MIT Women needed to finish among the top eight teams at the <a href="ncaa.res.pdf">NCAA Division III Outdoor Track &amp; Field Championship</a> to clinch the Deb Vercauteren Program of the Year Award. The Award honors the program with the highest total finishes at Cross Country, Indoor Track &amp; Field and Outdoor Track &amp; Field NCAA Championships. The program is awarded the same number of points as the team finish. After finishing second at Cross Country nationals and a tie for fourth at the Indoor Track &amp; Field Championship, a total of 14 or fewer points would put MIT ahead of UW Lacrosse if they won Outdoor Nationals since they were 13th at Cross Country Championships and won Indoor. MIT's fifth place finish gave them a total of 11 points and the Program of the Year. The last time they won the award was 2010.</p>
              <p align="left">At the Awards Banquet the night before the start of the meet, MIT came away with six awards. Carrington Motley '16 earned the Elite 89 Award for men, an award given to the student-athlete at the championship with the highest GPA on a 4.0 scale. If there is a tie it goes to the one with the most units. Last year Motley lost the tie, but this year his perfect GPA won out. Cimmy Virdi '16 was voted the New England Region Female Field Athlete of the Year. Maryann Gong '17 was vote the New England Region Female Track Athlete of the Year. Coach Nick Davis was voted the New England Region Men's Assistant Coach of the Year. Coach Todd Linder was voted the New England Region Women's Assistant Coach of the Year and Coach Taylor was voted the New England Men's Head Coach of the Year.</p>
              <p align="left">Virdi, the top seed in the Pole Vault, did exactly what she was expected to do. Passing the first seven heights and coming in at 12-11 1/2 with only one other vaulter still in the competition. She cleared on the first attempt while Marissa Kalsey from Westminster College cleared on the third attempt. At 13-3 1/2, Virdi again cleared on the first attempt, and again Kalsey cleared on the third attempt with an assist from the official who was very generous with all wind aided bar displacements due to poles knocking the bar off. At 13-7 1/2, Kalsey missed all three attempts and Virdi, who had already won on misses, cleared to put an exclamation point on her victory. She then attempted to break her own NCAA Division III record of 4.27 meters by going for 4.32 meters, or 14-2. She moved up poles after crushing her pole on the first attempt, but the flex was too stiff, making the change of poles too much to adapt to.  Abby Klein 'G, clearing 11-3, 11-9 3/4 and 12-1 1/2 on third attempts, was over 12-3 1/2 on her third attempt, but after leaving the pit, the shaking bar was displaced, disallowing the make.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 1500 and 400IH trials, Maryann Gong '17 and Hannah Chen '18 advanced to Saturday's finals. Gong, despite having a rather severe cold, managed to escape the very strategic trials, winning her heat in 4:36.87, closing the final 300 in 50 seconds despite being tripped coming out of the final turn and almost doing a face-plant. Chen battled a strong wind on the back-stretch and lane two to advance with a 61.54 second place finish, the fifth fastest time in the trials.</p>
              <p align="left">Veronica Szklarzewski '15, seeded 10th in her first NCAA Division III Championship as an individual competitor (All America in 4x100 in 2014), was flat on her takeoffs, managing a 17-6 effort, not enough to make the finals.</p>
              <p align="left">Elaine McVay '15, seeded 12th entering the 10K, ran a superb race. The initial pace was pedestrian at best as the first 400 was 1:30, but picked up nicely from there. McVay, who started near the back of the pack, continued to slide up in the pack and ready for the break-away as she hit 1600 splits of 5:45, 5:43, 5:48 and 5:50, before she took the lead with a 85 second quarter. She soon felt this was a mistake and she backed off to an 89, dropping far back in the pack. McVay's spurt started the break-away of four runners and she was not with them. She was in sixth, moved around after one lap and set off after the fourth place runner, who was falling back. Her fifth 1600 was 5:49 as she went after fourth. She passed her and went for third as her last 1600 was a 5:43. She was not able to make up the final distance, but still closed in a 82 to claim fourth in 36:00.69. Nicole Zeinstra '16 got gapped early in the race, tried to make up the gap, but lost focus and fell back. She finished 16th in 37:17.96 after entering as the 17th seed.</p>
              <p align="left">The men, represented by only four athletes, were hoping to gain All America honors for each competitor. While Ken Cooper '15 missed finals in the Discus by mere inches on a 51 meter sector foul, the event in which he is seeded to score is the Hammer Throw.</p>
              <p align="left">Matt Deyo '16 did his job. Seeded 18th in the 10k field, the junior (sophomore eligibility) finished fourth in an absolutely superb race. The initial pace was mind numbing as it became clear no one wanted to put the target on their back under the windy conditions. After 3200 meters of 5:20 and 5:13 pace, things finally started to roll. A 4:53 was followed by a 4:51 and then things really started to roll. Deyo at times appeared to just be holding on as a breakaway of three was followed by six more with Deyo looking pretty uncomfortable as his group ran a 4:46. Deyo moved into fourth, but was unable to maintain the pace and was passed back. This was the best thing that could have happened because the rest of the group that had been dropped, was coming back. The back and forth of Deyo and Morrison of North Central kept them at 72-73 pace. In the final 400 Deyo again moved into fourth, but everyone was kicking, making it obvious Deyo could end up anywhere from fourth to seventh. Hammering out a 66 final lap kept the others at bay, one was less than .4 behind. His final time was 30:59.58.</p>
              <p align="left">Ken Cooper '15 started things off on Friday, which for the most part was a day off for the MIT team. The Hammer Throw for men and then women was all the Engineers were entered in. Seeded seventh, Cooper had high hopes of getting All America honors. In the trials, Cooper was near the back after the first two rounds. On his final throw in the trials he threw 58.83 meters to finish third in his flight. After the final flight he was in fifth entering the finals. In the finals Cooper threw 59.43 (195') for a personal best to move into fourth place. This was temporary as he was passed by one person, bringing his All America dream to fruition, finishing in fifth place.</p>
              <p align="left">In the women's Hammer Throw was represented by two throwers, Ashley Wheeler '15 came in ranked ninth and Jackie Vahey '17 was seeded 22nd. For both women it was their first time at Nationals. Vahey was in the first flight and threw 158-2. Wheeler started with a 169-0 throw, but could not improve on that throw, missing finals by one person.</p>
              <p align="left">Saturday began with Arinze Okeke '17 and Motley in the Triple Jump. Both competed well. Okeke jumped 47-8 in the first flight and Motley 47-3. Going into the final round of the final flight, they were still ranked fifth and seventh respectively. However, after the final round they were ranked eighth and 11th. Okeke did not improve in the finals and got passed by the ninth jumper to finish in ninth, one place out of All America honors.</p>
              <p align="left">Next up was Gong in the 1500 final. Still a little sick, but feeling better than she did on Thursday, the sophomore was very nervous about her condition. The initial pace was pretty slow at 73 for the 400 and 2:27 for the 800. Tricia Serres '16 of Luther College took off and only Gong went with her. The third quarter was a 68 and with 300 meters to go, Gong began to fall off. Her sickness had taken away some of her strength, but she kept fighting. Her final 300 was in 52 seconds, but she was passed by two more to finish in fourth overall in 4:28.58, just shy of her personal record. MIT now had 20 points.</p>
              <p align="left">Chen was next for MIT in the 400IH finals. The freshman was in lane eight on the nine lane track. She started well and although her steps were a little off, she maintained pretty good momentum throughout the race. In the final straight she was able to finish strong to run 61.15 and finish fourth to give MIT five more points.</p>
              <p align="left">Michelle Johnson '15, seeded 19th in the Triple Jump, did her best, jumping 38-4 3/4 to miss finals by 12 centimeters and her PR by five centimeters. Johnson's jump was good for 14th place overall.</p>
              <p align="left">The women's Javelin was up and Tilly Taylor '15 was hoping to add to her team's score. Seeded sixth, going into the final throw it was not looking as though she would make finals. Taylor gathered strength from her cheering teammates and threw 143-5 to move into eighth place and make the finals. She was not able to move up, but did not get passed. Her eighth place was good for one point.</p>
              <p align="left">Gong and Zeinstra started the 5K just as the Javelin finals were getting underway. With most of the participants having already raced either the 10K or 1500, no one wanted to push the pace. The first 1600 was 5:54, but it gradually picked up as the second 1600 was 5:25. Things then got interesting as the leaders pushed the pace and the pack split up. The final 1600 for Gong was 5:16 as she fought to stay with the leaders. In the final 400 she was dropped but managed to hold onto third in 17:11.90. Zeinstra fell off in the final 1600, but held on for 13th place in 17:39.70, well ahead of her 16th seed going into the race.</p>
              <p align="left">The women's final tally was 32 points for fifth place while the men totaled nine points for 27th place.</p>
