   <p><strong><font size="4">MIELCARZ AND KHAN LEAD ENGINEERS TO 
VICTORY IN TEXAS</font></strong></p>
   <p align="left">MARCH 29, 2003</p>
   
  <p align="left">MIT's men's track and field team put an exclamation point to 
    the end of a great week spent at the University of Texas at Pan American in 
    Edinburg, Texas with a victory over UTPA and the University of Texas A&amp;M 
    at Corpus Christi. MIT scored 141 points to 136 for A&amp;M and 79 for UTPA.</p>
   <p align="left">Venturing in Texas for the first time on a spring break trip,
     the track team was looking for good weather and good competition. They got
     both as they dealt with 80 degree temperatures with low humidity all week.
     The meet day was only 70 degrees and began with cloudy weather but it was
     probably better that way so the effects from the sun were lessened on such
     a long day.</p>
   <p align="left">The meet was scored as a tri-meet by NCAA rules, which meant
     each team was allowed two scorers per event with awarded points 
being 7-5-4-3-2-1
     and relays scoring 7-5-0.</p>
   <p align="left">Craig Mielcarz was the leading scorer for the Engineers with
     23 points. Mielcarz won both the high jump (6-7 1/2) and the long 
jump (21-10
     3/4), placed 2nd in the javelin (144-5) and 3rd in the110HH (15.91). Chris
     Khan did not score as many points, but he did earn two victories 
and qualified
     for nationals in both events. Khan began the day with a personal 
best of 187-4
     in the hammer and followed it with another national qualifying performance
     of 163-2 in the discus. The discus throw was truly a remarkable throw as it
     was with the wind, the worst case scenario for a good discus 
throw. Khan also
     placed 3rd in the shot put with another personal best of 45-9 for a total
     of 18 points.</p>
   <p align="left">Field events carried the day for MIT, particularly 
the throwing
     events, all of which MIT won. Uzoma Orji set the freshman record in winning
     the shot put with a throw of 51-6. Orji had a fine day for his 
first collegiate
     outdoor track meet. In addition to winning the shot put he also placed 3rd
     in the discus with a 127-5 effort and threw 140-3 in the hammer. 
Dale Cotton
     won the javelin with a throw into the wind of 162-1. David Saylor did his
     part by placing 3rd in the hammer with a heave of 157-6.</p>
   <p align="left">In the jumps, Brian Hoying showed he is back from his broken
     foot with 6-5 1/2 in the high jump for 3rd place and 21-0 1/2 in the long
     jump to tie for third. In the triple jump Rick Rajter placed 3rd with 41-9
     and Victor Williamson 4th with 40-6 1/2. Nate Ball could not make the trip
     to compete in the pole vault as is hamstring is still healing.</p>
   <p align="left">Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi dominated the running 
events, particularly
     the sprints. MIT's wins in the running events were only in the 
distance events.
     All of the times were slow as the runners had to deal with a ferocious wind
     in the circular events and running into the wind in the sprints. 
Ben Schmeckpeper
     took first place honors in the 3000 steeplechase with a 9:54.30. 
He was followed
     by Craig Wildman in 2nd with a 9:55.19. Sean Nolan won the 5000 in 15:24.83
     after placing 3rd in the 1500 with a 4:08.03.</p>
   <p align="left">MIT faired well in the hurdle events as freshman 
Chris Peterson
     placed 2nd in both the 110HH and the 400IH, running 15.78 and 
56.91 respectively.
     Williamson also placed in the 400IH, running a fine time of 57.96.</p>
   <p align="left">In the sprints, Zach Traina ran 11.69 in the 100 to place 4th
     and 23.27 in the 200 for another 4th place. David Blau placed 3rd 
in the 100
     when he ran 11.58. Marc Washington earned 5th place in the 200 with a time
     of 23.55.</p>
   <p align="left">In addition to his jumping efforts, Hoying placed 4th in the
     400, running 53.70. Placing right behind Hoying was Thad Wozniak, who ran
     54.89. </p>
   <p align="left">Steve Stoddard placed 4th in the 800 with a 2:06.53 
and George
     Hanson ran a 2:07.42 for 5th. Neither relay team placed in the meet. In the
     400 relay the final exchange never happened, disqualifying the team and in
     the 1600 relay, the time of 3:27.70 was not good enough to get 
the job done.</p>
   <p align="left">Next Saturday, MIT hosts the Engineers Cup against 
RPI and WPI
     at 11:30.</p>
