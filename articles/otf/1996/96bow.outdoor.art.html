<h2><center>MIT TRACK REMAINS UNDEFEATED</center></h2>

    This past Saturday , the MIT Men's Track and Field Team made the trip to 
Brunswick, Maine to face the top three Division III Teams from Maine, Bates,
Bowdoin, and Colby.  Tech was not only as injured as they were last week, but
were also without the services of Andrew Jamieson '99 because of illness, and 
Akin Aina '96 because of a family matter.
    Once again, it did not seem likely that MIT would emerge victorious.  
However, due to somoe clutch performances and the opponents balancing out each
other's strengths and weaknesses.  This was indicated in the score (MIT 69, 
Bates 48, Colby 46, and Bowdoin 44).  MIT scored in all but one event (100 
meter dash), and secured at least a 2nd place in 13 of the 18 other events.
    Coming through the biggest for MIT was Co-captain John Wallberg '96, who 
won 3 events; the Hammer in 186-4, the Discus in a personal best 152-5, and the
Shot Put in 45-3.  This was especially significant because Bates scored the
remaining points in those three events except for a third by George Torres '99
in the Discus with a personal best of 130-9, qualifying him for the NE Division
III Championships in three weeks.  
    Many others contributed key performances.  One was Morio Alexander '96, who
came from behind in both the Long Jump and the Triple Jump to nab 2nd and 1st 
places respectively.  Morio also was a last minute replacememt for Aina in the
victorious 400 Relay. 
    Neal Karchem '99, placed 2nd in the 400, but nailed down the victory in the
200 meters with a personal and team best of 23.27.  Neal was also a key figure
in both the 400 Relay which finished 1st and the 1600 Relay which finished 2nd.
    The other Co-captain, Hung Hoang '96, also came through with come from 
behind points in the Long and Triple Jumps, earning 3rd and 2nd respectively.
Hung also came away with a 4th place in the High Jump.
    Once again the 1-2 punch in the middle-distances of Dan Helgesen '97, and 
Joel Ford '98 was a major threat as the pair went 2-3 in the 800 meters and 
3-4 in the 1500 meters.  Joel added a great leg in the 1600 Relay.
    The meet was still in question with three events to go.  Freshman Mike
Parkins, still fatigued from his 2nd place time of 9:41.5 in the 3000
Steeplechase, double back in the 5000 with the hope of scoring a potentially
necessary point or two.  It was not until the 5000 was over and the results of
the Triple Jump were announced, and it appeared obvious that Wallberg would win
the Discus, that Coach Halston Taylor knew the victory was in hand.
    Next week the Track Team goes across town to meet Tufts and Bates in what 
will undoubtedly be the most difficult meet of the season.  Coach Taylor feels
that if the Techmen can get healthy, they will have a chance against a very
good Tufts team.
