  <p><strong><font size="+3">ORJI AND ANDERSON LEAD THE WAY AGAINST MAINE SCHOOLS 
    AND 21-1 FINAL RECORD</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 16, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">Brian Anderson is back for his final season of eligibility after 
    nearly a year away from running caused by an injury to his hamstring and glute, 
    and Uzoma Orji picked up right where he left off - winning. On a perfect spring 
    day that saw temperatures near 70, sunny skies and a slight wind that picked 
    up as the meet progressed, MIT took advantage, scoring 283 1/2 points to 203 
    for Bates, 131 for Colby and 59 1/2 for Southern Maine.</p>
  <p align="left">Bates College proved to be the perfect hosts as they allowed 
    a tardy MIT team to join the hammer throw, an event already in progress and 
    delayed the pole vault, long jump and high jump by half an hour to allow the 
    Engineers an opportunity to properly warmup. In addition, their best athlete 
    was in a non-scoring decathlon and others were not in their best events as 
    they tried to maneuver people around to prepare for their upcoming championships.</p>
  <p align="left">Not wanting to waste the opportunity given them, Orji and David 
    Saylor responded with a winning throw of 179-11 and a personal best of 168-6 
    for third place respectively. Orji nearly threw a personal best in winning 
    the discus with a throw of 153-0 and just fouled on a 56 foot throw in the 
    shot put, which he easily won with a 54-2 1/2 effort.</p>
  <p align="left">Leading the way on the track with two of the team's 11 total 
    victories, Anderson finished hard over the final 300 meters into the wind 
    to run 3:58.08, a sign he is nearly back to his All America form from the 
    past. Anderson put an exclamation point on this a little over 30 minutes later 
    with a come from behind 1:56.74 800 victory. Lending support in both of these 
    events, Fivos Constantinou ran 4:00.94 in the 1500 for third place and added 
    a fourth in the 800 with a 2:00.69 time. Also of note, in the 1500, John Brewer 
    showed he was almost back from his stress fracture as he qualified for the 
    New England Division III Championship with a 4:04.50 fourth place performance. 
    Carlos Renjifo added a fifth place in 4:05.50.</p>
  <p align="left">Omari Stephens continued his winning trend in the high hurdles, 
    this time running 16.56 into the wind. Stephens also claimed a personal best 
    with a 13-0 pole vault to qualify him for the NE Div. III Championship in 
    three weeks.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina had a terrible start in the 100 but made up for 
    it with a victory in the 200 over Xavier Garcia, one of the top 400 runners 
    in the country. The time of 22.57 was an indication how much the headwind 
    had picked up by the end of the meet. David Blau lended support in both sprints 
    with a season best of 11.18 in the 100 for second place and a 22.95 in the 
    200 for fourth place.</p>
  <p align="left">Other victories in the field events were supplied by; Makinde 
    Adeagbo, who jumped to an outdoor best in the triple jump of 43-2 1/4 for 
    the victory, Nate Ball, who returned from a slight hamstring pull with a 15-0 
    pole vault victory and Nestor Hernandez, who leapt to a 21-4 3/4 victory in 
    the long jump.</p>
  <p align="left">On the track, Ben Schmeckpeper added a steeplechase victory 
    in 9:36.14. Support was given by Chris Bruce in his steeplechase debut, returning 
    after a long sabbatical from a calf injury to run 10:11.81 for third place 
    to narrowly qualify for the NE Div III Championship. Also running well, Kevin 
    DiGenova nearly ran a personal best with his 10:38.69, which was good for 
    sixth place.</p>
  <p align="left">Two other events of note, the 5000 and 1600 relay produced outstanding 
    performances for this time in the season. Kevin Brulois and Chris Wong ran 
    season bests of 15:38.45 and 15:38.78 respectively to place third and fourth 
    in the quality field. Traina, Anderson, Jesse Collins and Kenny Rosche combined 
    to run 3:23.96 in the relay, a time no where near what they should do later, 
    but a great time given the short rest in the meet and how early it is in the 
    season.</p>
  <p align="left">Placing second among 18 teams at UCSD, winning the Engineer's 
    Cup and this meet gives MIT an outstanding record of 21-1 for the season. 
    The team is anxiously waiting for the championships as they begin to peak 
    in their respective events.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, the Engineers are at home in a non-scoring invitational 
    where they hope to sharpen their performances and rest up for the NEWMAC Conference 
    Championship the week after.</p>
