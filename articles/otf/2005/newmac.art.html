  <p><strong><font size="+3">TRAINA AND ORJI LEAD WAY TO FIFTH STRAIGHT NEWMAC 
    CHAMPIONSHIP WITH DOUBLE VICTORIES</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 30, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">Despite a strong effort by Springfield College, MIT came out 
    strong with 90 points in the first five events, kept the effort strong with 
    double victories by Uzoma Orji and Zach Traina and closed out the victory 
    with 60 points in the final four events to win their fifth consecutive NEWMAC 
    Championship and sixth out of the seven championships since the conference 
    began in 1999. Following MIT's 246 points were Springfield College with 199, 
    Coast Guard with 167 1/2, host WPI with 78, Wheaton College with 54 and Babson 
    bringing up the rear with 15 1/2 points.</p>
  <p align="left">The meet opened with the 10K and MIT set the tone for the afternoon 
    by claiming 2-4-5-6, by Ian Driver, Joe Roy-Mayhew, Spencer Dudley and Brian 
    Jacokes respectively. All but Dudley ran personal bests, but Driver perhaps 
    had the performance of the meet. Running a solid race by negatively splitting 
    with miles of 5:26, 5:21, 5:21, 5:21, 5:16 and 5:19 before finishing with 
    a 68 final quarter, Driver nearly caught the winner, who had lapped the field 
    and then faded to within eight seconds of losing the race. Driver's final 
    time of 33:12.38 was a personal best by over a minute. Roy-Mayhew, a freshman 
    who was injured since the summer, missing both cross country and indoor track 
    and just started racing four weeks ago, has continued to amaze his teammates 
    by consistently racing well beyond all expectations, this time running 33:44.07 
    to qualify for the New England Division III Championship.</p>
  <p align="left">During the rain soaked pole vault, Patrick Barragan and Omari 
    Stephens went out early but not before clearing 12-5 1/2 to place sixth and 
    seventh. Nester Hernandez cleared 13-5 1/4 with no misses in the competition 
    to claim second. Nate Ball entered the competition after everyone else was 
    finished, cleared 14-6 and then 15-7 to set the meet record before retiring 
    for the day with the victory.</p>
  <p align="left">In the hammer throw, number one seed Uzoma Orji lost for the 
    first time this season, but did so to teammate David Saylor. Saylor threw 
    a personal best, national qualifying mark of 175-0. The 1-2 finish provided 
    MIT with 18 more points. Throwing a personal best in the rain showed how good 
    Saylor really threw.</p>
  <p align="left">Back on the track, Ben Schmeckpeper took the steeple lead at 
    the gun and won by 34 seconds as he ran a personal best and meet record of 
    9:20.0 while also qualifying provisionally for the NCAA Championships. Supporting 
    another 1-2 finish, Chris Bruce ran a personal best of 9:54.1. Kevin DiGenova 
    rounded out the scoring with an excellent finish to take over eighth place 
    in a season best of 10:32.1.</p>
  <p align="left">The 400 relay was next on the track and the number one seeded 
    Engineers did not disappoint their teammates. David Blau got a good start 
    and had Tech in the lead at the first exchange to Kenny Rosche. Despite a 
    foot injury, Kenny ran one of his best legs of the season. Jonathan Hsieh 
    stumbled as he took off to get into position to receive the handoff from Roshce, 
    causing him to be no where near full speed when he received the baton. Nevertheless, 
    Hsieh ran his strongest leg of the season, giving him a significant lead as 
    he approached anchor leg Traina, who did not hesitate to put the race away, 
    finishing in a season best of 42.70. These first five events put MIT in a 
    commanding lead with 90 points and they never looked back.</p>
  <p align="left">The drought of points in the high jump and javelin did not keep 
    MIT down. In the 1500, Brian Anderson, Fivos Constantinou and John Brewer 
    placed 2-3-4 with Anderson running a season best of 3:57.73 as he continues 
    his comeback. Carlos Renjifo gave support with an eighth place performance. 
    In the field, Nestor Hernandez came through with his second second place in 
    as many events when he jumped 21-1 1/2 in the long jump. Tom Hoover placed 
    fifth and Makinde Adeagbo held onto eighth to build MIT's lead.</p>
  <p align="left">In the 110HH, Stephens did not place first as he was seeded, 
    but he did get third and Anthony Teixeira, who was not expected to place at 
    all, came in fourth with a personal best of 16.50. In the discus, Orji found 
    his winning touch despite the rain with a throw of 140-03.</p>
  <p align="left">When MIT dropped below expectations in one event, they would 
    step up big in another event to more than make up for the points lost. A good 
    example was the 400 and 100 dashes. In the 400, Kenny Rosche, seeded 5th, 
    placed 6th with a very respectable 50.62. In the 100, Traina and Blau put 
    their considerable talents together and placed 1-2 in a season best for Traina 
    of 11.01 and a personal best for Blau in 11.10. Hsieh added two points with 
    his 7th place finish.</p>
  <p align="left">The triple jump did not go as expected as Adeagbo was not able 
    to come though and settled for fourth place. Teixeira, having a great meet, 
    jumped his season best to place 6th. On the track, Chris Desrochers ran a 
    huge personal best by nearly a second, running 57.99 in the 400 IH to place 
    5th.</p>
  <p align="left">Anderson returned to the track in the 800 and looked great as 
    he took the lead and kept it through 700 meters. However, he was passed by 
    two runners in the final straight to finish third in 1:56.43. Constantinou 
    ran 1:59.88 to finish 8th. </p>
  <p align="left">The 200 put the meet away as Traina, Blau and Rosche finished 
    1-3-5 for a nice 20 point score. Not to be outdone, the distance runners scored 
    22 points in the 5000 by placing 2-3-4-6. All MIT runners broke 16:00 with 
    Kevin Brulois in 15:35.24, Eric Khatchadourian in 15:39.28, Chris Wong in 
    15:42.02 and Erik Stafl with a 15:46.60.</p>
  <p align="left">With the rain really coming down, Orji took to the shot put 
    circle. Aided by teammates Brian Malley and John Brewer keeping the circle 
    dry with towels each time before he threw, Orji threw a season best of 55-11 
    to win easily.</p>
  <p align="left">The final event on the track, the 1600 relay was led off by 
    Traina with a 50.1 leg, his best ever. Brian Anderson was only able to put 
    together a 51.9 leg, as was third leg, Jesse Collins. Rosche anchored with 
    a 50.3 but it was not enough to claim first. The team had to settle for second 
    with a time of 3:24.22. For his efforts and superb performances, Zach Traina 
    was named Outstanding Male Athlete in the NEWMAC Conference for the season.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT heads west to Springfield College for the New 
    England Division III Championships. MIT is seeded to place second behind Williams 
    College but Bates and Tufts are seeded just a couple of points behind.</p>
