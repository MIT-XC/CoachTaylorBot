  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT PREPARES FOR NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH END OF SEASON 
    PERSONAL BESTS</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 15, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">Due to the conflict with having two prestigious championships 
    on the same weekend, MIT split their squad between the All New England Championship 
    (NEICAAA) hosted by the University of New Hampshire and the IC4A Championship 
    held at Princeton University. The Engineers left home some qualifiers who 
    could have scored so they could focus on their exams that start on Monday, 
    taking only those who were preparing for, or hoping to qualify for, the NCAA 
    Championship.</p>
  <p align="left">At UNH, only David Blau and David Saylor made the trip and both 
    made the most of their opportunity. David Blau ran two personal bests in the 
    100 and 200 meter sprints. In the 100, Blau ran 11.00 to move to fifth on 
    the all time MIT list. With a short rest, Blau came back in the 200, running 
    22.16, dropping over three tenths of a second off his personal best.</p>
  <p align="left">David Saylor did not throw a personal best in the hammer throw, 
    but he only missed doing so by six inches. What he did do was finish fourth 
    to score five points for MIT.</p>
  <p align="left">Down at Princeton, Ben Schmeckpeper got things rolling with 
    a 5000 personal best and national qualifying time of 14:37.58. The time moved 
    Ben to number six on the all-time MIT list. Ben ran a smart race, pacing it 
    well through two miles. The first mile was 4:37 and the second mile 4:41 as 
    things began to string out in the back of the pack. At the end of the second 
    mile Schmeckpeper slowed to 72-73 for four laps before picking it up to a 
    71 on the next quarter and finishing with a 31 final 200. He obviously finished 
    with too much left but in that third mile he did not feel he could go any 
    faster. Nevertheless, the time puts him at number 12 among the NCAA Division 
    III qualifiers.</p>
  <p align="left">Brian Anderson was next to test his skills against the best 
    Division I 800 runners on the east coast. Anderson, sick with a head cold, 
    went out in the middle of the pack and looked good until he got spiked on 
    the front of the leg at the end of the first 200. A lot of jostling for position 
    caused Anderson to alter his stride a few times in the first quarter, which 
    was 54.0 for the MIT graduate student. At the 600 mark Anderson second guessed 
    himself and missed an opportunity to move up in the pack. Anderson faded in 
    the homestretch but still managed an outdoor track personal best and national 
    qualifying mark of 1:52.84. The performance moved Anderson to number four 
    on the MIT 800 list and number 10 among the NCAA Division III qualifiers.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina took his turn on the track in the 200 meter dash. 
    Getting the inside lane, Traina got out well and ran a solid race but was 
    unable to improve on his 21.53 mark as he finished in 22.10.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji, entered in both the hammer and shot put, started 
    with the hammer throw. Orji looked good in warmups, landing a couple in the 
    185 foot area. However, in the competition he was unable to achieve the same 
    distance as he struggled with being aggressive and achieving fast turns. Orji 
    managed a good series but his farthest throw was only 178-6, not good enough 
    to make finals.</p>
  <p align="left">In the shot put, Orji had his best performance of the season 
    and best series of the year. All six throws were between 55-2 1/4 and 57-3. 
    His performance earned him a fourth place finish and owner of all five points 
    for MIT.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, on Thursday and Friday, MIT heads back to Springfield 
    College for the ECAC Division III Championship. This meet is in essence a 
    last chance qualifier rather than a championship for MIT. Only those with 
    a chance at the NCAA Division III Championships will be making the trip, which 
    are being held at the same time as final exams for MIT.</p>
