  <p><strong><font size="+3">BALL SETS MIT POLE VAULT RECORD AT UCSD COLLEGIATE 
    INVITATIONAL</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">March 26, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">Not missing a step from the indoor season, Nate Ball won the 
    pole vault at the UCSD Collegiate Invitational with a school record and national 
    qualifying vault of 16-8 3/4. Ball's finale helped lead MIT to a second place 
    finish among the 18 teams participating in the meet with 90.5 points. Ball 
    entered the event at 15', giving everyone on the Tech team a scare when it 
    took him two attempts to clear the height. Ball cleared 15-6 on his first 
    attempt and then needed three attempts to clear 16-0, having to move up in 
    poles on his last attempt. This third attempt seemed to psych out the USC 
    vaulter who thought he had the event won. Ball, sensing the opportunity to 
    put the event away, easily cleared 16-6 on his first attempt to which the 
    Southern Cal vaulter had no response. On his third attempt, Ball cleared 16-8 
    3/4 with a solid clearance. Moving the bar to 17-00 3/4 Ball had three good 
    attempts but each time knocked the bar off on his way down.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji supported the Tech effort by scoring 24 points to 
    lead all MIT scorers. Orji won the hammer on day one with a very average throw 
    of 172-7, fouling on three of his four throws. On day two, Orji won the shot 
    put as expected with a solid series of 54 foot throws, the best being 54-5 
    1/2. Unable to get in good throwing position, Orji only managed a fifth place 
    in the discus with a toss of 145-10. Assisting Orji in the hammer, David Saylor 
    added a third place when he threw 159-2.</p>
  <p align="left">Garnering the only other victory for MIT, Zach Traina pulled 
    away in the final 50 meters to win the 200 dash in 22.03, a fine time for 
    the first meet of the season. Earlier in the day, Traina had placed seventh 
    in the 100 with a 11.11 time and anchored a fourth place 4x100 team to an 
    excellent 42.87 performance. The 4x100 team was composed of David Blau, Kenny 
    Rosche and Jonathan Hsieh. In addition to his impressive leadoff in the 4x100, 
    Blau placed eighth in the 100 with a time of 11.19</p>
  <p align="left">In the middle distance and distance events MIT scored 23 points. 
    Ben Schmeckpeper led the way with an impressive double, running his first 
    ever 10K on the first day and earning a second place in 31:51.11. On the second 
    day, Schmeckpeper came back with a fifth place in the 5k, running 15:22.25. 
    Eric Khatchadourian ran well in his first meet of the season by placing sixth 
    in the 10K with a 33:15.07. Although he did not place, Khatchadourian's time 
    of 15:55.67 was an impressive performance after having run the 10K the day 
    before. Also in the 10K, Chris Wong missed placing by one position but qualified 
    for the New England Division III Championship with a 33:45.84 performance. 
    Fivos Constantinou and Brian Anderson got the job done in the 1500, placing 
    third and seventh respectively. Anderson, racing for the first time in a year, 
    was unable to hold his early pace of 2:05 at the 800 and faded to 4:03.65. 
    Constantinou, running a more even pace, ran a 4:00.92 for a great start to 
    his season.</p>
  <p align="left">In the jumps, Nestor Hernandez and Makinde Adeagbo added much 
    needed points to the Engineer's effort. Hernandez jumped 21-3 1/2 on his first 
    attempt in the long jump to place fourth overall. On his final attempt he 
    launched a jump well over 22 feet but fouled by about an inch. Also doing 
    well in the pole vault, Hernandez added a tie for eighth when he cleared 13-5 
    3/4. Adeagbo also achieved his best effort on his first attempt when he jumped 
    42-6 3/4 in the triple jump, an effort good for fifth place.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT will have some of their squad compete at the 
    Tufts University Snowflake Classic. On April 9, the team opens at home with 
    their first complete squad meet when they go against traditional rivals RPI 
    and WPI.</p>
