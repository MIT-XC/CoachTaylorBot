  <p align="left">MIT was privileged to host one of the few last chance qualifiers 
    approved by the NCAA but somehow the weather man did not get the message it 
    was supposed to be a nice, spring-like day. Although the promise of rain never 
    came to fruition, it was chilly and not conducive for national level performances 
    except in the 10K and only two participants appeared in that event.</p>
  <p align="left">The NCAA, in hopes of keeping potential national qualifiers 
    from entering competitions where the meet management does not follow NCAA 
    guidelines, instituted a rule that on the final weekend prior to the national 
    championship, an athlete could only qualify by entering a sanctioned last 
    chance qualifier. MIT was selected to be the host site for the northeast region. 
    The meet was open to all participants, both collegiate and open. In all, nearly 
    300 athletes competed in the full slate of events.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT only entered seven athletes, two of whom had already qualified 
    for nationals and five who thought they might have a chance. Ben Schmeckpeper 
    led Chris Fidkowski and Carlos Renjifo in the quest of running a national 
    qualifying time in the 3000 meter steeplechase. Schmeckpeper was hoping to 
    put together a perfect race and Fidkowski and Renjifo were hoping to continue 
    to improve at the 10 second per race clip they had been doing lately. All 
    three raced well but none were able to improve on their times. Schmeckpeper, 
    who ran 9:31.15, would have run a personal best but did a face plant in the 
    water pit on the last lap when he slipped off the water barrier.</p>
  <p align="left">Brian Anderson, still mounting his comeback from hamstring / 
    glute injury, made a valiant effort in the 800. Not able to train properly 
    due to the restrictions placed on him by his healing muscles, Anderson hoped 
    for an evenly paced race. However, his first lap in 54 seconds was a little 
    too fast and Anderson's final 200 showed the fatigue he was feeling, finishing 
    in 1:55.79.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina, within a tenth of a second of qualifying in the 
    200 meters, was hoping for a nice tailwind. What he got was cool temperatures 
    and virtually no wind at all. The results brought him a slow time of 22.36, 
    which was not helped by a relatively slow start. Traina's technique was very 
    good said Coach Halston Taylor, but the conditions just were not conducive 
    for fast times.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji did not get the results he wanted in the hammer throw, 
    fouling out with a combination of sector and foot fouls. However, he won the 
    shot put with an effort of 55-7 despite a slow start.</p>
  <p align="left">Nate Ball, not only won the pole vault, he set a personal best 
    en route with a final clearance of 15-10 1/2. Ball made his height on his 
    final attempt at that height. His attempts at 16-0 were not really close but 
    he knows he will need to clear that height at nationals if he wants to guarantee 
    himself All America honors.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, the Engineers head to Millikin University for the 
    NCAA Division III Championship. MIT will be represented by Ball in the pole 
    vault and Orji in the hammer and shot put.</p>
