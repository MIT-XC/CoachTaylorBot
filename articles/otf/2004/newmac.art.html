  <p><strong><font size="+2">TECH TRACK STEPS IT UP TO WIN 4TH STRAIGHT NEWMAC 
    CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 24, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">After a somewhat disappointing regular season due to a lack 
    of depth in all events, MIT Men's track and field team stepped up their intensity 
    and performances to defend their NEWMAC Conference championship, winning the 
    event for the fourth year in succession and fifth in the six year history 
    of the event. MIT's 178 points, was enough to outpoint favored Springfield 
    by 30 points. MIT, seeded to score 161 points, matched or exceeded their seed 
    points in every event except the 800 and 5000. The Engineers even scratched 
    from the final event, the 1600 relay since there was no need to pile up points 
    or add fatigue to those getting ready for next week's championship.</p>
  <p align="left">Nearly everything came together for the Engineers on this sunny 
    but extremely windy day. Uzoma Orji, seeded to win his three events (hammer, 
    discus, shot put) did just that. Orji began the day in the hammer, an event 
    he has struggled with lately as he tries to strike a balance of position and 
    speed. He found some of that balance, winning with a throw of 176-4. His second 
    event, the discus throw is another event Orji is trying to get comfortable 
    with. His technique is coming around but is not at the point where he can 
    put all of effort into the throw. In this competition, he was again able to 
    find the correct positions, throwing 151-10 to win by nine feet. Orji's specialty, 
    the shot put, is starting to come around after a few weeks of working on some 
    basics. Orji simply focused on throwing far and certainly accomplished that, 
    setting a new meet and MIT record with a put of 56-11 1/4.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina brought his game and came to play. Traina led off 
    the 4x100 relay, opening up a 10 meter lead at the first handoff to lead Tech 
    to a third place finish against a very talented group of sprint teams. In 
    the 100 trials and finals, Traina showed he is ready for the championships, 
    running 10.95 in the finals for 2nd place. A loss of focus and not getting 
    the most out of his start cost him the victory, but there is the New England 
    Division III Championships next week and another opportunity to run the perfect 
    race. Traina's specialty, the 200, looked perfect for the first 180 meters, 
    but then he tried too hard, slowing a bit coming into the finish line. Despite 
    the technical flaws, Traina won the race in 22.41.</p>
  <p align="left">Due to the wind, most of MIT's other big points came in clusters 
    where the individuals on the team worked together and helped each other to 
    defeat the other teams. A perfect example was the extreme effort in the pole 
    vault by MIT's trio of Nate Ball, Nestor Hernandez and Josh Chartier. Despite 
    an inconsistent crosswind that would sometimes change to a tailwind, Hernandez 
    and Chartier fought their way one height at a time, helping each other with 
    advice to finally clear 12-9 to outlast all other vaulters except teammate 
    Ball, who had yet to come in. At 13-3 Ball's first attempt was not successful 
    as the wind prevented him from attaining a clean bend of the pole, sending 
    him into the right standard. With his teammates encouragement, Ball made the 
    next attempt with over a foot to spare. Given the risk of the wind, Ball stopped 
    their, satisfied with MIT's 1-2-3 sweep.</p>
  <p align="left">Another example came in the long jump, an event that has not 
    gone well for MIT all year. Hernandez was back from his hamstring injury but 
    was suffering from an illness that had him on antibiotics during the week. 
    The jumpers rallied like they haven't done since last year. All jumpers had 
    year bests, with rookie graduate student, Stuart Laval, leading the way with 
    a PR of 20-11 3/4 for third place. Right behind Laval was Hernandez at 20-5 
    1/2 for 4th. Thad Wozniak jumped 19-11 to garner the last scoring spot. Chris 
    Bateman, who had just secured a sixth place in the high jump missed scoring 
    in the long jump by one place, jumping a season best of 19-6 3/4.</p>
  <p align="left">The first running event showed further evidence of MIT's team 
    work. Spencer Dudley and Ian Driver, running the 10K for the first time, worked 
    together and followed the plan to perfection. Both ran 82 second quarters 
    perfectly through three miles, letting others do the work of leading the race. 
    After three miles, Dudley picked up the pace to take over second place for 
    good, finishing in 33:48.68. Driver could not follow but managed to open up 
    a lead over fourth place. With one mile to go, the fourth place runner had 
    closed the gap on Driver to three seconds and had been moving up two seconds 
    per lap. Driver responded to the urging by his teammates, dropping the pace 
    to 77 over the final two laps to pull away and secure third place in 34:15.24.</p>
  <p align="left">In the steeple chase, Carlos Renjifo, Chris Fidkowski and Robbie 
    Bryant all ran personal bests or right at it despite the strong winds. Renjifo 
    took the lead after one lap and broke the wind for the rest of the pack, but 
    still winning in 9:56.53, a time within two tenths of his best. Fidkowski 
    followed, at times working side by side with Renjifo, but finishing in second 
    in a best of 9:59.32. Bryant struggled the entire race to stay with the pack, 
    sometimes falling two seconds out and looking like he would not get back in 
    it, but each time he did just that. In the final lap and a half Bryant pulled 
    into third and never looked back, finishing in a PR of 10:02.19. </p>
  <p align="left">In the 5000 meter race, Coach Halston Taylor had the MIT contingent, 
    two of which were returning from the 1500 race, hold back for the first half 
    of the race so they would not have to fight the wind or overly fatigue themselves. 
    The objective was to place high enough to secure the team victory. This they 
    did, as Ben Schmeckpeper led Kevin Brulois and Eric Khatchadourian to a 2-3-4 
    finish. </p>
  <p align="left">Other MIT athletes displayed superior performances to place 
    well. Makinde Adeagbo, competing in the triple jump, added two feet to his 
    best, jumping 42-4 3/4 to place second and qualify for the New England Division 
    III Championships next weekend. In the 1500, despite the 76 second first quarter, 
    MIT runners placed second, fourth and fifth as Brian Anderson came within 
    .21 seconds of the win but his still healing hamstring would not allow him 
    to kick. Schmeckpeper and John Brewer assisted with the fourth and fifth places. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT takes twenty qualifiers to the New England Division 
    III Championships at Williams College. MIT is not expected to be a threat 
    for the title but they are sure to be a presence.</p>
