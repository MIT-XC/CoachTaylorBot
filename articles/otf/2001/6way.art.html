<P>April 14, 2001</P>

<P>What was scheduled to be a four way meet between MIT, Bowdoin,
Tufts and UMass/Lowell turned into a 6 way meet between MIT, Bowdoin,
Bates, Colby, Tufts, and Southern Maine. MIT, getting accustomed to
doing without key competitors Brian Hoying and Rick Rajter, benefited
other stepping up their performances to lead the way to victory as
Tech outscored their opponents by more than 100 points. MIT 253,
Tufts 138, Bates 129.5, Bowdoin 107.5, Colby 55 and USM 38. The
scoring went eight deep with a system of 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 for open
events and 10-8-6-4-2-0 for the relays.</P>

<P>Due to the large amounts of snow throughout most of the state of
Maine, Colby College asked if they could move their meet to Bowdoin,
bringing along Bates and USM. UMass/Lowell pulled out for unknown
reasons. Bowdoin did a tremendous job of snow removal, which allowed
everything but the jumps to be conducted outside, even if the banks
of snow lining the track were three feet high.</P>

<P>Right from the start things started going well for MIT. Craig
Mielcarz led the way in the long jump with a 21-0 on his one and only
jump, which aggravated his hamstring. Junius Ho and Victor Williamson
added 6th and 7th places to give MIT the lead. At the same time, the
javelin was being conducted from a makeshift approach off the track.
MIT did not expect to do well in this event but Mark Jeunnette and
Spiros Michalakis came through to garner 2nd and 3rd places with
throws of 157-10 and 153-7 respectively. Dakus Gunn lended assistance
with an 8th place throw.</P>

<P>Shortly after, the 3000 Steeplechase started. The other teams put
their top steeplers in the 1500 and MIT dominated with a 1-2-5
finish. Craig Wildman led the way with a 10:01.4 followed by Phil
Loiselle. Ian Bliss knocked more than 20 seconds from his time to
finish 5th in 11.00.9.</P>

<P>The hammer was also finishing about this time. While MIT did not
dominate the event, they did place 4th and 5th despite the absence of
Brian Wong. Chris Khan had a PR of 161-0 to just outdistance fellow
freshman Marios Michalakis by less than 2 feet. Both are chasing the
freshman record of 169-4.</P>

<P>The 400 Relay team was not expected to place well, but Tech
continued to come through on this day as they placed 3rd with great
handoffs. MIT ran 44.80 due to the strong winds keeping the times
slow.</P>

<P>The 1500 was stacked with All American Dave Patterson from Tufts
as well as Steeple All American, Justin Easter from Bates. Rounding
out the elite field was Pat Vardaro from Bowdoin who ran in the
indoor 5000 at nationals. MIT had their hands full but seemed more
than capable of handling the task. Brian Anderson took the lead for a
brief period after 700 meters. This move picked the pace up
considerably as the leaders went from running 68 to 63 for the
quarter. Sean Montgomery took the lead to stay with 400 to go,
running the final 300 meters in 44 seconds. Anderson finished 2nd
with Sean Nolan, continuing to surprise, taking 4th behind
Vardaro.</P>

<P>At this point the meet was well in hand but the Engineers
continued to perform as if the meet was on the line. Marc Washington
came through big in the sprints with times of 11.20 for the victory
in the 100, and 22.63 to finish 2nd in the 200. Both times were
personal bests for Marc. He was supported by Robbie Gray in the dash
(11.72), and Yuval Mazor in the 200 (23.14)</P>

<P>Mazor led the way for MIT in the 400 with a 50.69 under very windy
conditions to place 4th. Matt Lehman ran a personal best 50.94 to
come in 6th.</P>

<P>The 400IH was one event that was a bit of a disappointment for
Tech. Expecting to dominate after Greg Devine from Tufts, MIT instead
only secured 2nd and 4th places by Mark Jeunnette and Tony Pelosi.
Scheduled to run but unable to due to the scheduling of the jumps in
the indoor arena were Victor Williamson and Adrian Townsend. Craig
Mielcarz also had to sit out this event as well as the 110HH due to
his ailing hamstring.</P>

<P>The 800 got things going in the right direction again as
Montgomery and Anderson performed their 1-2 act once again. Sean won
in 1:58.48 and Brian added in a 1:59.00. MIT went 1-2 in every event
from the 800 to the 5000. Sean Nolan came back from his 1500 to win
the 5K in 15:23.49 and was followed closely by teammate Ed Keehr in
15:25.04.</P>

<P>In the other jumps, Mielcarz jumped 6-6 right after his long jump,
before he iced his leg, to win that event. In the Pole Vault, MIT
showed their strength as Sam Thibault led an assault by the Tech
vaulters with a personal best of 14-9. Dan Kwon earned 2nd with 14-0
and Dan Opila came in 3rd with 13-6. Kalpak Kothari jumped well but
missed first by 2 centimeters with a triple jump of 44-2 1/2.
Supporting Kalpak were Williamson in 4th and Gray in 7th.</P>

<P>In the remaining two throws, Francisco Cruz came through with a
5th place in the Shot Put (40-7), and Chris Khan won the Discus with
a final throw of 149-2. Greg Walker, having had a non-scoring PR in
the hammer, made this one count with another PR of 122-11.</P>

<P>The final running event was the 4x400 relay. MIT was favored but
both Bowdoin and Tufts had run mid 3:20 times this season. With good
performances in the open 400, MIT decided to go for a good time
despite the windy conditions. Jeunnette led off with a fine 51.7
split, exactly the same as the week before. Anderson followed with a
51.5, also the same as last week. At this point MIT had a 50 meter
lead and for all practical purposes the race was over. Nevertheless,
Lehman continued to have a good day, running 50.1. Mazor finished off
his 4 performance day running a 50.8 to bring the baton home
first.</P>

<P>The Engineers had a very good day overall. With the expected
return of Hoying and Rajter next week the team looks to start getting
ready for the Championships. The final tune-up of the season will be
at the Northeastern Invitational next Saturday starting at
10:00AM.</P>
