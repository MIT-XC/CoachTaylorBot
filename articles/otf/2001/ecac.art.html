Fall in ECAC Division III Championship</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>May 17-18, 2001</P>

<P>MIT's Men's Track and Field team entered the ECAC Division III
Championships, hosted by Springfield College, with the sole purpose
of qualifying people for nationals, or improving the marks of those
who had already qualified. Given the cool, windy conditions, one
automatic mark and two improved provisional marks were quite an
accomplishment. Six season bests along with a varsity record in the
High Jump and yet another freshman record in the Hammer made the meet
an incredible one for MIT.</P>

<P>The first annual ECAC Division III Championship for Men was held
on a Thursday and Friday because of Springfield's graduation. The
meet, basically a last chance qualifier that few schools treat as a
scoring meet, much less a team championship, was attended by colleges
from the New England states as well as New York, New Jersey, and
Pennsylvania. MIT had qualified 25 individuals, many in more than one
event, but only brought 10 along because of the team philosophy to
treat this meet as an opportunity only for those with a chance of
going to the NCAA Championship.</P>

<P>The first day had the trials in the 100 and 110HH as well as the
Hammer Throw. Marc Washington ran a fine 11.18 into a slight headwind
to make Friday's final. Rick Rajter followed suit in the High Hurdles
with a 15.23.</P>

<P>In the Hammer, Marios Michalakis and Chris Khan waged their
friendly weekly war to decide who would end up with the freshman
Hammer Throw record. Chris, who was in possession of the record,
opened with a near record performance of 169-5. On his second throw,
Marios unleashed a 172-0 effort to take the record and 6th place in
the competition. Neither improved on these marks even though they
both had their best series of the season. Marios's throw has him
ranked 20th in the division III national ranking.</P>

<P>Friday's competition opened up with the High Jump. Craig Mielcarz
had jumped 6-9 two weeks in succession. Unfortunately, the following
heights had increased to 6-11, which Craig did not make. His 6-9
success had him ranked in a tie for 13th on the national list with 5
other athletes. This was enough to convince Craig he needed to jump
in hopes of getting the automatic standard of 6-9 1/2. Craig had a
shaky start and did not seem "into the competition", missing attempts
at 6-3 1/2, 6-5 3/4, and at 6-8. At 6-9 1/2 Craig missed his first
two attempts badly, but cleared the third attempt by at least 2".
Having made the automatic standard, the height went to 6-11 1/2.
Craig had the height on all attempts as well as a solid effort on his
second attempt, but was not able to clear it. Craig's jump set the
MIT varsity record and placed him second in the meet.</P>

<P>The first event on the track for MIT was the 1500. Freshman Brian
Anderson was attempting to improve on his provisional mark of
3:55.65. Sean Montgomery, seeded 3rd in the 800 was running the 1500
to help Brian with the pace and to see what kind of strength he had
after missing so much training due to his quad injury. Sean was
shoved back at the start and stumbled badly going in to the first
turn. Brian took the lead on the backstretch and came through the
first quarter in 62. Brian backed off at the 600 mark so Sean moved
to the lead. Coming through splits of 2:05 and 3:07, Sean looked
great. Brian had seemed to lose focus and was fading quickly. Sean
eased in to the finish, getting passed in the final 10 meters, but
ran a solid national qualifying time of 3:53.05.</P>

<P>In the 110HH final, Rick Rajter ran his best race of the year. It
was a technically sound race from start to finish. However, it was
into a headwind, leaving Rick with a 15.14 performance, good enough
for 3rd place, but not improving on his provisional qualifying time
of 14.88.</P>

<P>Kalpak Kothari was also trying to better his provisional
performance in the Triple Jump. Kalpak's best is 46-6 and he needed a
47-3 or so to give him a solid chance of making the NCAA field.
Kalpak jumped well with a 44-8 performance, but was unable to put
everything together on one jump.</P>

<P>Yuval Mazor, primarily at the meet to see if the 1600 relay team
could qualify for nationals, was running the open quarter to see if
he could break the 50 second barrier. Seeded 21st with a 50.49, Yuval
went out perhaps a little too hard in his section. Yuval definitely
had the look of one struggling to make the finish but nevertheless
ran a PR of 50.09 to place 7th on this windy day. A conservative
first 200 would surely have brought the sub 50 quarter he was looking
for.</P>

<P>Chris Khan stuck around the second day to see if he could get a
little more practice in the Discus. With qualifying already taken
care of, Chris did not seem very psyched to be competing. Off balance
and not aggressive, Chris struggled to throw 144'. On the plus side,
Chris has worked some of his flaws out and should be ready to compete
at nationals.</P>

<P>Marc Washington, at the meet primarily as an alternate in the 1600
relay, was also taking advantage of the opportunity to compete in
open events. Looking good the day before with his 11.18, Marc did not
bring any of that magic with him on the 2nd day. Marc ran 11.41 and
22.92 in the 100 and 200 finals.</P>

<P>Mark Jeunnette, another MIT runner in Springfield for the 1600
Relay, participated in the 400IH in hopes of reaching a provisional
qualifying mark. Mark ran a good race but lost time on the 6th and
7th hurdle. His time of 56.14 was his best of the season, but no
where near his potential.</P>

<P>As usual, the 1600 Relay was the final event of the day. Due to
Marc Washington's bad day and Rick Rajter having suffered through a
stomach ailment all day, MIT was putting together their ninth
different combination of the season to try again to qualify for
nationals. This iteration had Mark Jeunnette leading off, which he
did as well as anyone has all season, running 50.4. Yuval continued
to show he is a better relay runner than an open runner as he once
again broke 49, this time with a 48.7 split. Brian Anderson was up
next. Brian got out well but after the 200 mark seemed to lose focus.
He was passed, which seemed to wake him up. The last 100 meters was a
battle with the Amherst runner, which certainly did not help Brian's
time. The third split was 50.2. Sean Montgomery got out well on the
anchor leg but seemed to be holding back for the first 300 meters. As
he was getting passed by two more teams, he picked it up and finished
very strong, running a 49.4 split. Sean, it turned out had a tight
hamstring that he was concerned about and did not want to go out too
quickly. The overall time of 3:18.71 was the best of the season, but
not good enough to make nationals.</P>
