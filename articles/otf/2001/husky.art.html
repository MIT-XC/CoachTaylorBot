<P>April 21, 2001</P>

<P>MIT Men's Track and Field team took a weekend off from scoring
meets to go to the Husky Invitational hosted by Northeastern
University at their track in Dedham. Tech endured the long time
schedule with hopes of attaining some good performances against the
mostly Division I and II field. The warm temperatures and strong but
inconsistent tailwind aided the jumpers and sprinters but did little
to assist the other performers.</P>

<P>Many personal and season bests were achieved and not just by the
sprinters and jumpers. Consistently, throughout the day, Tech runners
passed people in the homestretch to finish their races strong. In the
middle distance and distance events MIT competed well and each event
had at least a season best despite the strong winds. Matt Yarosz ran
a very even paced 1500 to knock 3 seconds off his best in running a
4:10.80 time. In the Steeple Chase, Craig Wildman shaved a few tenths
off his performance with an aggressive race leading to a 9:57.11
time. Sean Nolan ran his best outdoor 5000 by far in placing 3rd with
a 15:06.64.</P>

<P>Season bests were achieved in the 800 by George Hanson (2:01.83),
Alan Raphael (2:02.20), and Matt Yarosz (2:03.99). All finished
strong, showing there may be more to come in the Championships next
weekend.</P>

<P>Mark Jeunnette went out much stronger than he has in earlier meets
in the 400IH. He ran a season best of 56.67 but may have run much
faster were it not for a severe stutter on the final hurdle. As it
was, he finished 4th and must wait until next week to see if he can
put the whole race together. All three 400 runners won their
respective sections but the wind was just too strong to guarantee
good performances. Yuval Mazor ran 51.02, Matt Lehman 51.14 and Todd
Rosenfield 52.29. Again, all finished very strong, passing many in
the final 100 meters.</P>

<P>Mark Washington had a pretty good day, running a PR in the 200
with a 22.57 to place 4th and a 11.28 in the 100 despite a slow
start. Marc has come a long way in the sprints this year. Thus far,
he has dropped his time in the 100 by .16 and in the 200 by .53. MIT
is hoping for big things once Marc gets his start down. Robbie Gray
also ran a season best in the 100 with a clocking of 11.50.</P>

<P>Rick Rajter ran the 110HH for the second time this year and
recorded a PR of 15.32. He has a lot of room for improvement so the
future is bright if Rick can stay healthy. Junius Ho, nursing a
tender hamstring also ran a season best of 16.54, but that is far
from Junius's personal best of 15.73.</P>

<P>In the field events, Dan Kwon led the way with his second PR in as
many weeks. Dan jumped 14-6 to qualify for the All New England
Championships. Overall the vaulters did well in the meet with Sam
Thibault also clearing 14-6 and having some very good attempts at
15-0. Dan Opila cleared 13-6 for the 2nd consecutive week.</P>

<P>Kalpak Kothari continued to improve each week, jumping 45-0 1/2 in
the Triple Jump to set his best mark of the season and only 3" behind
his best ever. Also jumping well in the horizontal jumps was Robbie
Gray, who set season best in both the Long Jump (20-10 3/4) and
Triple Jump (41-0 1/2). Victor Williamson, just beginning to recover
from his overused legs, jumped 41-6 in the Triple Jump for his season
best.</P>

<P>In the throws, Spiros Michalakis is beginning to return to good
form in the Javelin. Spiros threw 161' for his season best. In the
Hammer, Scott Bradley has a PR of 123-8, just ahead of David Saylor's
PR of 121-8.</P>

<P>Next week, the Engineers travel to WPI to compete in the New
England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Championship.
This is the 3rd year of the Championship. The first year, MIT won but
last year Springfield won on their home track.</P>
