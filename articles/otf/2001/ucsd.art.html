OUTDOOR SEASON WITH SEVENTEEN NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III QUALIFYING
MARKS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>March 31, 2001</P>

<P>At the conclusion of a very warm and sunny week in California,
twenty four members of the MIT track and field team represented their
Institution in the University of California San Diego Invitational.
Despite the hard week of training and the fact that this was the
first meet of the outdoor season, seventeen New England Division III
qualifying marks were achieved by the Engineers.</P>

<P>Thanks to the very generous donations by the Friends of MIT Track
and Field, the men's team took their annual spring break trip to the
warm climate of California to kick start their outdoor season. Still
working on the strength phase of their season, the Engineers
nevertheless expected to perform well with the great competition
offered at this meet.</P>

<P>In addition to the New England Division III qualifying marks,
their were twenty ECAC Division III qualifying marks achieved and
four All New England marks. Leading the way was Sean Montgomery in
the 800 meters. After running a 3:55.32 1500, Sean won the 800 with a
1:52.77 effort. Rick Rajter, still feeling the effects of an injured
hamstring during the indoor season, only competed in the 110HH and
High Jump. Rick showed his tremendous potential by running 15.55
after a poor start and a slight breakdown in form in the middle of
the race. Rick also jumped 6-4 in the High Jump. On Friday night, Ed
Keehr ran the 10,000 meter race in 32:24.8. Ed maintained a
consistent pace with his slowest 400 being a 79 and his fastest being
a 75. The final All New England qualifying performance was turned in
by the 4x400 relay team with a 3:22.34. Brian Hoying led the foursome
off with a 51.7 after jumping 21-2 1/2 in the Long Jump, 6-6 in the
High Jump and 51.23 in the 400. Mark Jeunnette took the baton and
made up some ground on the Division I schools with a 50.5 leg. Mark
also had a busy day with a 1:56.50 800 and a 59.82 400IH that
included a full fall and roll after the 5th hurdle. Yuval Mazor ran
the third leg in 49.6 to close the gap on the leaders. Yuval had run
50.98 in the 400 and 23.55 in the 200, both out of lane 9, earlier in
the day.</P>

<P>Other New England Division III performances were turned in by the
following:</P>

<P>Brian Anderson, 800, 1:55.06</P>

<P>Craig Mielcarz, High Jump, 6-06</P>

<P>Dan Kwon, Pole Vault, 13-11</P>

<P>Sam Thibault, Pole Vault, 13-11</P>

<P>Dan Kwon, Pole Vault, 13-06</P>

<P>Kalpak Kothari, Triple Jump, 43-02 1/4</P>

<P>Marios Michalakis, Hammer, 164-07</P>

<P>Brian Wong, Hammer, 157-00</P>

<P>Chris Khan, Discus, 141-02</P>

team begins their quest for an undefeated season when they travel to
Troy, NY to compete against RPI and WPI.</P>
