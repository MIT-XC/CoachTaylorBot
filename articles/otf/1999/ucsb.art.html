SHOWING AT SANTA BARBARA RELAYS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>March 20, 1999</P>

<P>Santa Barbara, CA</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>After a very demanding week of mid-term exams and projects with
little sleep, MIT Men's Track and Field team traveled most of the day
Friday to Claremont, CA for the beginning of their annual Spring
Trip. On Saturday morning they traveled an additional 2 hours to
Santa Barbara to compete in the Santa Barbara Relays. The first half
of the day was warm and sunny, basically what the team came out west
for. However, half way into the meet, the rain came. While it never
rained hard, it did rain most of the meet.</P>

<P>Even with the rain, MIT was still happy to have 60+ degree
temperatures. The first event was the hammer throw. Jason Dailey set
a personal best with a 140-6 effort. Alumnus, Todd Chamoy, also
competed and threw 148-10.</P>

<P>In other throwing events, Peter Bluvas threw 135-2 in his first
ever effort in the Javelin, and 39-4 in the Shot Put. Jordan Alperin
threw 31-5 in the Shot Put, and 90-1 in the Discus for his first
effort ever.</P>

<P>In the jumps, Roger Nielsen cleared 6-0 in the High Jump to match
his best effort. Sam Thibault made 13-0 in the Pole Vault to qualify
him for the New England Division III Championships. Robbie Gray
jumped 19-11 3/4 and 37-9 1/4 in the horizontal jumps, while Kalpak
Kothari leaped 19-6 and 40-7 3/4.</P>

<P>Ravi Sastry did not feel ready to compete due to his ankle and
hamstring, but the members of the 400 Relay competed anyway with Sam
Thibault taking Ravi's place at anchor. The foursome of Gray, Neal
Karchem, Todd Rosenfield, and Thibault won the event with a 44.60
effort.</P>

<P>In the hurdle events, Jordan Alperin ran 16.72 and 60. in the
400IH. Roger Nielsen and Bluvas ran 17.64 and 17.74 respectively in
the 110s and 61 and 62 in the 400IH.</P>

<P>Sean Montgomery returned to action with a 4:18.10 effort in the
Mile to win . Leif Seed faded a little at the end but still managed a
3rd with a 4:21.06.</P>

<P>The 3000 Meter Steeplechase saw Mark Strauss return to good form
with a 9:27.18 run to narrowly miss provisionally qualifying for
nationals. Mike Parkins faded after the mile mark but still ran
9:42.28.</P>

<P>Chris McGuire ran away with the 5000, winning by over 200 meters
with a 15:07.70 time. Mark Strauss attemped to come back but a sore
hip limited him to a 16:04.95.</P>

<P>The rest of the meet was about relay events. The Sprint Medley
Relay led off with 200 legs by Gray and Kothari that put MIT well out
of the hunt. Alan Raphael ran a 52.7 400 leg to make up a few meters
before he handed off to Seed. Leif ran a 53.6 first 400 to make up
the entire 30 meters but faded during the final 200 to finish with a
1:55.0 anchor.</P>

<P>The Distance Medley Relay did not go well for MIT but the
competitive effort was there. Phil Loiselle, coming back from a 10:15
effort in the Steeplechase, was not able to stay with the leaders in
the 1200 meter leg, coming through with a 3:26. Sean Montgomery ran a
50.8 to make up considerable ground, but John Biesiadecki, despite a
56.9 first 400 finished in 2:05.9 to lose too much ground for Mike
Parkins to make up in the anchor. Nevertheless Mike ran a 4:35 mile
to finish off a long day on the track.</P>

<P>In the 1600 Relay, Yuval Mazor led off with a 52.9 effort to put
MIT about 10 meters behind. Karchem made up that ground with a 50.9
before handing off to Rosenfield, who ran a 51.7. Montgomery, running
his 3rd event established a 30 meter lead by the 200 mark, finishing
with a 49.9 to win in 3:25.32.</P>

<P>Next Saturday the team will be in San Diego to compete at the UCSD
Invitational.</P>
