Nationals</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>March 27, 1999</P>

<P>Getting the type of weather they had been hoping for, MIT's Men's
Track Team took advantage of the opportunity at the USCD
Invitational, and qualified numerous individuals for the New England
Division III Championships.</P>

<P>Leading the way for qualifiers was Leif Seed, who two years ago
set personal bests in the Steeplechase, 1500, and a 400 leg in the
1600 Relay. Leif continued his string of successes with a huge best
in the 800, winning the Invitational in 1:52.72. In the same race
Sean Montgomery continued his comeback from his broken toe with a
1:56.22 effort. Also in the 800 and setting personal bests were Alan
Raphael, with a 2:01.69 and Gus Blomquist, running a 2:04.62.  </P>

<P>A few hours later Leif and Sean returned to run the 1500. Mark
Hauser, who placed 3rd at the Division I Indoor Nationals, was also
in the race. Both Leif and Sean had been told of Hauser's attendance,
but they either forgot or decided they were on a roll and they should
milk it for everything it was worth. The 400 was in 58 and they were
right there. The 800 was in 2:00 and they were right there. The 1200
was in 3:01 and they were not there. Leif came back to run a
respectable 3:59.62, but Sean faded to a 4:06.46.</P>

<P>Approximately 20 minutes later, the 1600 Relay was starting with
Leif running 2nd leg and Sean running anchor. Expectations were low
due to the severe oxygen debt suffered by both athletes, but the need
to discover what the two had in clutch situations was paramount. Todd
Rosenfield, who earlier had run a PR of 50.96 in the open 400, opened
with a 51.5 leadoff. Leif was next and rose to the occasion with a PR
split of 50.1. Neal Karchem, who ran a 51.5 in the open 400, ran a
great leg in 50.8 to put MIT in a tie for 1st place going into the
exchange zone. Either Neal slowed slightly at handoff, Sean left a
split second too soon, or a combination of both because the initial
handoff was missed. Sean slowed to a stop, allowing the other team to
open up a 15 meter lead. Sean finished with a 52.1 (not too bad after
a complete stop once the watch had started) and a cumulative best of
3:24.52.</P>

<P>Ravi Sastry made a successful return to competition with a 21-10
1/4 leap in the Long Jump, a 15.35 in the 110HH into a headwind, and
a 11.60 in the 100, which was also run into the wind.</P>

<P>After a difficult week training for the decathlon, both Jordan
Alperin and Peter Bluvas has good days on the track and in the field.
Jordan ran 16.20 in the High Hurdles to qualify for the NE Div. 3
Meet, ran 59.54 in the 400IH, high jumped 6-0 3/4, and long jumped
19-2 1/2. Peter ran 16.32 in the highs, 60.61 in the intermediates,
threw 104-8 in his second effort with the Hammer, 97-8 in his second
effort in the Discus, and 38-0 1/4 in the Shot to round out a very
full day of competition.</P>

<P>In addition to Leif winning the 800, Chris McGuire won the 10K on
Friday with a first time effort of 31:48.39 in a great race against a
trio of UCSD runners. Chris came back in the 5000 on Saturday but due
to sore calves could only manage a 15:43.9.</P>

<P>Mark Strauss ran his second 9:27 effort in the Steeplechase in as
many outings to place 2nd in the Invitational field. Mike Parkins,
feeling the effects of a cold, only ran 9:53.45. Phil Loiselle, who
started out to fast and later took a header into the water jump,
finished in 10:22.62.</P>

<P>The pole vaulters were separated into open and invitational
sections, but both did well. Sam Thibault vaulted 13-5 1/4 and Matt
Potts leaped 12-11 1/2 to miss NE Div. 3 qualifying by 1/2 inch.</P>

<P>Other personal and season bests were set by Jason Dailey in the
Hammer with a 144-0 effort, Roger Nielsen with 60.15 in the 400IH,
and the 400 Relay team of Robbie Gray, Karchem, Rosenfield, and
Montgomery running 44.43.</P>

<P>MIT is at WPI on April 3 to try and regain the Engineer's Cup
after losing it for the first time last year to RPI.</P>
