<P>April 17, 1999</P>

<P>Most of the meets between the Men's Track and Field Teams of MIT
and Tufts are exciting, close meets. Fortunately, MIT usually comes
out on top. The meet on Saturday lived up to both historical
expectations.</P>

<P>While not completely healthy, the MIT team was healthy enough to
have all but two of their athletes competing. Arturo Esparza, a
freshman steeplechaser may have a stress fracture, and Matt Potts, a
New England Division III place winner in the Pole Vault, was taking
the MCATs.</P>

<P>The Long Jump was the first event to go off. Ravi Sastry took the
lead in the Long Jump over favored Rommel Childress from Tufts with a
21-11 leap. Childress could not adjust his approach for the wind
conditions and either fouled or was way behind the board. Ravi's
hamstring is not healed but it felt good enough to go for it on his
2nd attempt in the finals. He hit the board well, kept his head up
and extended to a personal best of 23-4 3/4, which qualifies him
provisionally for the NCAA Championships. Jordan Alperin added a PR
of 20-1 3/4 to take 4th place.</P>

<P>Being only a dual meet, the throwing events did not take long,
particularly since neither MIT nor Tufts have very strong throwing
teams right now. Tufts went 1-3 in the Hammer while MIT took 2-4-5
with Jason Dailey leading the way for MIT with a 141-5 effort. The
Discus was sad for both schools. Tufts went 1-2-3 with the winning
throw only going 118-11. The good news is that decathlete Peter
Bluvas threw 108-5 to bolster his chances of doing well in the
Decathlon in 3 weeks. Peter also came through in the Shot Put with a
throw of 41-9 to claim second place. As expected, the best news in
the throws came from Nikos Michalakis. The sophomore further improved
on his varsity record with a heave of 198-9, which moves him to 5th
on the <A HREF="http://www.raceberryjam.com/nc3odmenperf.html">national
list</A> .</P>

<P>Tech did well in all of the jumps, outscoring Tufts 41-23. MIT
went 1-2-3 in the Pole Vault despite the absence of Potts. Sam
Thibault and Sam Sidiqi both cleared 13-0 to tie for 1st (deciding
not to have a jump off), and freshman Dan Kwon vaulted to a PR of
13-0, but claimed third based on more misses. Ravi Sastry, Jordan
Alperin, and Roger Nielsen, who is returning to competition after
missing two weeks, claimed 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in the High Jump to keep
the pressure on Tufts. In the Triple Jump, Kalpak Kothari had his
season best of 43-7 1/4, but fell to Childress on his final
attempt.</P>

<P>While the 800-5000 provided Tech with their usual domination of
points (44-20), it was not quite as strong as hoped. Things got off
on the wrong foot as David Patterson took the Steeplechase from Mike
Parkins (9:36) and Mark Strauss (9:40.4). Parkins is just recovering
from an upper resperitory infection and Strauss looked unusually
tired. Phil Loiselle ran a season best of 10:00.6 to claim 4th. In
the 1500, the Engineers went 1-2-3 with Sean Montgomery leading Leif
Seed and Chris McGuire to the line with a sub 60 last 400. In the
800, Montgomery won again with a season best of 1:55.34, but Seed
feeling the effects of a cold, managed only a third with a 1:57.95.
Not being able to afford to relax with three events to go, the Tech
distance runners came back in the 5000. Chris McGuire led the way
with a 2:12 last 800 to win in a pedestrian 15:33.9. Dan Feldman
added support after leading most of the way with a second place.</P>

<P>With Ravi bowing out of the sprints in order to preserve his
hamstring for next week's conference championships, Tech got swept by
Tufts in the 100 and 200. However, MIT returned the favor in the High
Hurdles with Sastry leading the effort in a wind and hamstring
hampered 16.25. Bluvas and Alperin ran well for 2nd and 3rd.</P>

<P>The 1 lap events went about even for MIT. Both Neal Karchem and
Yuval Mazor ran season bests of 51.14 and 51.41 in the strong wind to
claim 2nd and 3rd respectively. Todd Rosenfield added a 4th but did
not finish well. With Leif running the 800, Tech did not have a
strong leader in the 400 IH. However, Tony Pelosi came through with a
PR of 59.8 to claim 2nd, and received support from Bluvas and Gus
Blomquist running to 3rd and 5th place finishes.</P>

<P>The relays were scored 6-0, the point swing could be as great as
24 points. Fortunately, both relays went in MIT's favor, or it would
have been a 4 point, and much more harrowing meet. In the 400 Relay,
Ravi was forced to strain more than hoped when he had to make up a 4
meter deficit on the Tufts anchor to win in a season best of 44.20.
In the 1600 Relay, Leif was unable to run do to his illness, so Mazor
was put into action. With three of the legs having run both the 400
and 200 (20 minutes before), and Montgomery having run the 1500 and
800 meter runs, the outcome was anything but automatic. Rosenfield
led off with a tired 52.1 to put MIT even with the Tufts runner.
Mazor ran a strong 51.4 to bring MIT within 2 meters of Tufts at the
handoff to Karchem. Neal ran his best leg ever (49.8) to give Sean
the baton just 1 step behind Tufts. Continuing his streak of
successful anchors (except the debacle in San Diego), Sean ran a 50.5
to pull the victory out at the end in 3:23.8.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT travels to Smith College for the inaugural NEWMAC
(New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference) Conference
Championship. Wheaton and Springfield will provide plenty of
competition, but if Tech can stay healthy, the strength in the
800-5000 should prove lethal to the conference opponents.</P>
