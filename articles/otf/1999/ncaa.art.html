<P>May 20-22, 1999</P>

<P>Although the MIT Men's Track Team qualified 7 individuals for the
Division III National Championships, only 4 were actually accepted
into the very competitive fields. The minimum number of athletes
accepted into each event is 15 for the Outdoor Championship, and the
committee fills the fields based on those athletes who have qualified
and entered more than one event in order to reach a fixed number of
total athletes at the meet. This usually means that each event has
about 17 athletes with the exception of the 100, 200, and 400, which
tend to have higher numbers because a number of the fill in people
are already there for a relay.</P>

<P>Those making the field for MIT were Leif Seed, who was seeded 3rd
in the 800, Sean Montgomery, who was seeded 9th in the 1500, Nikos
Michalakis, who was seeded 10th in the Javelin, and Ravi Sastry, who
was seeded 15th in the Long Jump. Not accepted into the fields were
Mike Parkins in the Steeplechase with a 9:17.9 performance, and Chris
McGuire and Dan Feldman in the 10k with 31:23.73 and 31:26.7
performances respectively.</P>

<P>Sean led things off on Thursday with his 1500 trial. Sean
established himself amongst the leaders, and moved when they moved.
Coming through splits of 62, 2:06, and 3:10, the leaders picked
things up over the last 300 meters. Sean finished with a 43 last 300
to end up 4th in his heat and that placed him 4th overall as well
with a 3:53.10 going into Saturday's final.</P>

<P>On Friday, Ravi went after the Long Jump in the morning. Not
having jumped competitively in two weeks due to his thesis needing
some work, Ravi seemed a little off on his timing. Consequently, he
only got off a jump of 21-10 3/4, far off of his best of 23-4 3/4.
Ravi ended up 15th in a field that required a 25' effort to place in
the top 3 and 23-8 1/4 to place.</P>

<P>Later in the day, Leif took to the track in the 800. The field in
the 800 was separated by only 2.15 seconds, and it took a 1:52.39 to
get into the meet. Leif was in the second of 3 heats that were
advancing the first two finishers from each and the next two fastest
times for Saturday's final. Leif's heat went out in a very slow 55.6
first quarter. Rather than panic, they all moved, very fast. Leif was
in position to move to the lead with 200 meters to go but held back a
second too long. Coming into the finish Leif lost a position and
finished in 4th, but with a new personal best of 1:50.86. The first
and third heats were much slower and Leif made it in as the 4th seed
overall into the finals.</P>

<P>On Saturday morning the Javelin started in a light rain after
there had been a downpour for the preceding two hours. This did not
help the grass approach, which was quite slick at the point of
release. Nikos, who had injured his back 3 weeks earlier, and had not
thrown at all for 3 weeks until testing it on Tuesday and Wednesday
to see if it was ready, seemed his usually confident self. The
thinking was that the wet surface might actually work to his
advantage since he depends on his amazing arm speed much more than
his leg block. Admittedly cautious, Nikos opened up with a 189'
effort that had him in 7th after the first round. In the second round
Nikos moved up to 6th, and in the final round of the trials, Nikos
moved into 4th place with a 193-0 effort. In the finals, Nikos was
unable to improve on his throw and one athlete moved past him in the
first round of the finals. Nikos earned his first All-American honor
while scoring 4 points for MIT in an amazing effort given his back
injury.</P>

<P>Nearly as soon as the Javelin was completed, Sean was on the track
for the 1500 final. This time the pace went out pretty quickly in 62
seconds, again with Sean tucked away in 3rd position. Robert Mitchell
from Amherst College, the defending champion in the 1500 and entered
in the 5000 in 50 minutes, obviously wanted to slow the pace down as
he took the lead and then backed off. The pack came through the 800
in 2:08, and then Mitchell took off. Coming into the home stretch
with a little over a lap to go, Sean was moving out a little to get
around the 4th place runner when the runner behind him shoved him in
the back, causing Sean to nearly fall down. Even though Sean came
through the 1200 in 3:08, it was obvious that the push took a lot out
of him, both physically and mentally. Most of the pack went by him in
the final 200 meters as he finished a disappointed 10th in 3:54.87.
With two years of eligibility remaining in Outdoor Track and 3
remaining Indoors, Sean is certain to be back to exact some
revenge.</P>

<P>Leif was the final Tech competitor. Set up in lane 1, Leif had to
be cautious to not let the others runners box him in when they broke
after the first turn. To accomplish this, Leif moved out to lane 2 as
they were moving in, and settled in the middle of the pack. Again,
the pace was slow going into the second lap as they came through the
400 in 55.3. Leif went with them but once again did not make a
crucial move with 200 to go. This mental lapse caused him to get
boxed in and in 6th place coming out of the final turn. Leif put the
hammer down as he squeezed and weaved past two runners. With a burst
in the last 10 meters, Leif moved into 3rd place with a time of
1:50.90. Leif, who last made it to Nationals in the 3000 Steeplechase
in his sophomore year, finished his career in fine fashion, earning
All-American honors and scoring 6 more points for MIT.</P>
