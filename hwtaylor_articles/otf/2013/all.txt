    ENGINEERS SET THREE  VARSITY AND THREE FRESHMAN RECORDS EN ROUTE TO QUALIFYING 15 FOR NCAA DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
                  
    
    May 16-17, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Track & Field team did not let the fact their final projects and theses were due, and that final exams being Monday, bother them. Quite the contrary, with three varsity and three freshman records and improved qualifying marks by most of the men's and women's team at the ECAC Division III Championship hosted by Springfield College, it seemed the Engineers were once again showing how they can do it all and excel at everything.
    
    
                  
    
    The meet began for Tech, with Jackie Konopka '14 in the Heptathlon. The NCAA takes 22 women and 22 men per event and 16 relay teams per relay event as there are no longer any qualifying standards. Going into the week, Konopka was 19th on the list and thinking about sitting on her mark. By Wednesday she was 24th and realized she had to compete. Her two day event, began with the 100HH and her 15.25 was the second best in the competition and the second best in her career. In the High Jump, she cleared 5-3, matching her second best of the year. In the third event, the Shot Put, she threw a season best 34-4 3/4. Konopka ended day one with a huge PR of 26.31 in the 200. Going into day two, the event that was the most inconsistent for Konopka was the Long Jump, but she did nothing but put down three great jumps, ending with a career best of 17-4. She hurt her shoulder in the Javelin but came back with a PR of 2:27.71 in the 800 to smash the MIT record of 4625 points, win the event, and move up to number nine on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Michelle Johnson '15 did not move up on the Triple Jump list, but she did add a centimeter to her existing varsity record, jumping 37-9 1/2 to place eighth. Carrington Motley '16 placed seventh with his second best jump ever at 47-0 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Both the men's and women's Pole Vault was the first day. In the women's event, Lauren Kuntz '13 won the event at 12-7 1/4 and Cimmy Virdi '16 placed fifth and earned a trip to Nationals with a freshman record vault of 12-1 1/4. Sherry Wan '16 cleared 11-1 1/2 but did not place. In the men's vault things did not go quite as well. None of the men improved their mark, but Cyrus Vafadari '13 placed sixth at 15-3 1/2. Clearing 15-9 would have likely earned him a trip to the NCAA's, but he was unable to make the height.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor '15, not having the most spectacular season compared to her freshman year last year needed to find some motivation. She knew she needed to produce instead of go through the motions. In her most competitive meet of the season, she threw 136-4 into a massive head wind to place fourth.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event of the night for MIT, Brooke Johnson '13, already with a solid qualifying time in the 1500 of 4:30.75, was going for a qualifying time in the 5K. The plan was to let others do the work if possible, but knowing she needed to run between 81-82 second pace, or about 17:00 to have a solid qualifying time. She was fortunate enough to have someone else set the pace through 2400 meters. She had been on 81 second pace at that point but then slowed to 83's as she took the lead. After hitting 3200 in 10:54 she hit another 83 and even though she started to lap runners Johnson slipped to 84 and then 87 pace before rebounding to 83 and then closing to 38 for the final 200 to win in 17:09.69. She is 25th on the NCAA list and may get in if some of those ahead of her choose other events at Nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two, after the Heptathlon, began with the men's 4x100. For the first time this year, MIT moved the marks back a step or two in order to move the handoffs deeper into the zone so the outgoing runners would be at full speed at the handoff. Unfortunately this only slightly worked. On the first exchange Michael DuPlessis '14 was unable to catch Michael Kaba '16 without him slowing slightly to make the handoff. Josh Duncavage '13 left a little late and Kaba ran up on him. Duncavage did not have the speed at the end and barely caught Tyler Singer-Clark '14, who slowed slightly to make a good exchange. Even with that, Singer-Clark burned the final 100 to get second in a season best 41.66, just off the MIT record, but good enough for 14th on the NCAA list, guaranteeing the quartet a trip to Nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    States Lee '16 fought the wind in the 400, but was too focused on time instead of racing. Without the adrenaline provided by actually racing he fatigued early, placing fourth in 48.42.
    
    
                  
    
    Michael Kaba, came back in the 400IH, but without the ability to master his non-dominant leg and being too fast for 15 steps and not fast enough for 13 steps, he could not help but stutter for eight of the ten hurdles. Somehow, he still managed to run 53.10 and place fifth. If he can hold 13 for two or three hurdles he might break 51 and earn All America status next week. Adrian Samsel '16 had his best race of the season, running 55.10.
    
    
                  
    
    Pat Marx '13 was late getting to the meet the day before as he had to get his thesis turned in. This did not affect his performance as he ran the best race of the year, pacing well and winning his section in a season best of 1:52.17. However, someone from the slower section ran faster to take first overall, leaving Marx in second place. At the end of the qualifying period Marx was sitting in 21st place, one place out of the National field unless someone ahead does not enter.
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's Shot Put, Isabella Stuopis '16 reset the freshman record while placing fourth with a PR of 42-11.
    
    
                  
    
    Sarah Quinn '16, down to about 15-20 miles per week due to her continued problems with her calves, did not let it affect her competitiveness. She was entered in the 1500, sitting with a 4:36, but realizing she would need a sub 4:33 to have a solid shot at Nationals. Trying to relax more early in the race, Quinn managed to let others do the work and to chill in third or fourth place. The pace was relatively quick to start with, hitting the 400 in 71. The pace slowed to 2:25 but was still fast enough for national qualifying. The third quarter stayed slow at 3:39, but Quinn took the lead with 500 to go and pushed the pace, perhaps a little too early. She ran the final 300 in 53, but was passed by two to finish in third with a 4:32.49. This put her in 18th on the NCAA list, earning a spot at Nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    Tyler Singer-Clark finished the meet for MIT, racing the 200. Singer-Clark had a best of 21.62 and was in a fast field with a two meter per second tail wind. He was as pumped as he could be. Undefeated in the 200 for the season, he was not about to lose on this day. Out well and running a great turn, Singer-Clark pulled away on the home stretch, winning in a new MIT record of 21.37, ranked sixth on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT will be taking 15-16 athletes to the NCAA Division III Championship in LaCrosse, WI from May 23-25. Representing the Engineers for the women will be Lauren Kuntz and Cimmy Virdi in the Pole Vault, Brooke Johnson and Sarah Quinn in the 1500, Tilly Taylor in the in the Javelin, Martina de Geus in the 3000 Steeplechase, Elaine McVay in the 10K, Jackie Konopka in the Heptathlon and possibly Johnson in the 5K. The men will be represented by the 4x100 Relay (Michael DuPlessis, Michael Kaba, Josh Duncavage, Tyler Singer-Clark), the 4x400 Relay (States Lee, Michael Kaba, Derek Barnes, Tyler Singer-Clark), Singer-Clark in the 200, Kaba in the 400IH and possibly Lee in the 400, Pat Marx in the 800 and Arinze Okeke and Carrington Motley in the Triple Jump. Those on the bubble will know for sure on Sunday and will then fly out to Wisconsin on Tuesday.

    MIT Sweeps Engineer's Cup, McVay Crushes 10K
    
    
                  
    
    April 6, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    MIT hosted the annual Engineer's Cup, a meet between Division III engineering schools; MIT, WPI and RPI. Despite holding back some key athletes on the men's side, MIT won all but two running events to dominate the competition with a score of 180 to 128.5 for RPI and 97.5 for WPI. The women had a very balanced showing, winning 12 of the 19 events to easily outscore the competition, winning with 201 points to 110 for WPI and 86 for RPI.
    
    
                  
    
    The most spectacular performance was one that did not even count in the scoring. Because of the lack of opportunities to race a 10K in non-championship meets, MIT added a non-scoring opportunity to start off this meet. The goal was to have Elaine McVay '15 go for a national qualifying performance (sub 36 minutes) and for a quartet of the men to go for New England Division III qualifying times (sub 33 minutes). However, while the temperatures of upper 40's were conducive for fast 10K times, the 15-20 mph gusts screaming down the backstretch and first turn were not. McVay, as usual, did not allow anything to phase her, particularly the strong winds. She needed to run between 86-87 seconds per lap, but opened up with two laps of 83, which could have been disastrous, and should have been, given absolutely no competition and the fierce wind gusts. Finally getting in the groove, McVay hit the 1600 in 5:37 and started to roll, hitting 1600 splits of 5:47, 5:45, 5:46, 5:48 and 5:46 before closing in 85 to run a remarkable 35:54.68, second best in the country for Division III at this time. The men; Matt Jordan '15, Allen Leung '15, Roy Wedge '14 and Matt Deyo '16, worked together remarkably well through 6400 meters, trading the lead, hitting 1600 splits of 5:14, 5:13, 5:11 and 5:11. Deyo, running his first race ever for MIT after coming into the cross country season with an extensive stress fracture, started to fall off the pace, but still raced well to finish in 32:37.66. The others continued to work together through a 5:09 fifth 1600 and then Jordan began to pull away, dropping a 5:01 before closing in 66 to win in 32:05.39. Leung finished strong in 32:25.75 with Wedge close behind in 32:27.59.
    
    
                  
    
    The women had many highlights in the meet as they brought a strong team approach to the meet and competed very well. Veronica Szklarzewski '15 put together a big day, winning the Long Jump in a personal best 17-0 and taking second in the 100 in another PR of 12.50. Szklarzewski also joined Jackie Brew '14, Michelle Johnson '15 and Jackie Konopka '14 to win the 4x100 Relay in 50.77.
    
    
                  
    
    Brooke Johnson '13, only ran one event, but it was pretty spectacular, putting together a solo effort for the win in the 5K with a 17:11.67, good for number four on the NCAA performance list. Johnson led a 1-5 sweep MIT. Martina de Geus '14 ran a personal best of 17:45.36 for second. Kali Benavides '15 finished third in 18:41.49. Dacie Manion '15, in her first race back since incurring a stress fracture during the cross country season, ran 18:41.64 for fourth and Shivani Kaushal '15 placed fifth in 18:51.25.
    
    
                  
    
    Kayla Harris '15 had a breakout meet, winning the 400 in 61.13 despite the wind and coming back with a 26.98 for third place in the 200.
    
    
                  
    
    Lauren Kuntz '13, did the expected, winning the Pole Vault in 12-5 1/2, leading her teammates to a 1-2-4-5 finish. Cimmy Virdi '16 placed second in 10-11 3/4 while Joanna Chen and Marissa Engle finished fourth and fifth at 10-0.
    
    
                  
    
    Christine Labaza '14 had a breakout throw in the Discus, unleashing a 120-5 1/4 PR for the win. Labaza also earned a fourth in the Shot Put.
    
    
                  
    
    Michelle Johnson '15 won the Triple Jump with a leap of 34-11 1/4. She also took fourth in the Long Jump with 16-4 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor '15 claimed first place honors in the Javelin with a wind obliterated 128-1.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, Sarah Quinn '16 debuted in the 3000 Steeplechase. The effort was far from graceful or efficient, but she stayed upright to win in 11:23.56. There will be big improvement in this event as she gets accustomed to the barriers.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500, Alexandra Taylor '14 took on the wind head-on, running splits of 73, 2:31 and 3:49 before bowing to Louise van den Heuvel '14 on the home stretch 4:43.47 to 4:43.15. The two came back in the 800 to do battle along with Cindy Huang '15. Huang took the gold in 2:21.03, leading start to finish. Taylor added a third and van den Heuvel a fourth. The trio joined Isabel Crystal '16, who placed second in the 400 to win the 4x400 in 4:10.30.
    
    
                  
    
    Although she did not win an event other than being a part of the 4x100 Relay, Jackie Brew had a big day, placing second in the 100HH in 15.32, second in the 400IH in 65.91 and third in the Long Jump in 16-8.
    
    
                  
    
    The men were behind early in the meet as MIT did not score in the Hammer Throw or Shot Put, but came back strong in the Long Jump, Triple Jump and Pole Vault, scoring 52 of 66 possible points. Yida Gao '13 led the way for the Engineer's in the Pole Vault, winning in 14-1 1/4. Cyrus Vafadari '13 cleared the same height but lost on misses. Ben Schreck '15 competed well, earning third with 13-1 1/2 and Marshall Wentworth '16 placed fourth with 12-7 1/2. 
    
    
                  
    
    Carrington Motley '16 was a double winner for Tech, taking the Long Jump and Triple Jump with respective jumps of 21-0 1/2 and 44-6. Arinze Okeke '16 took second in the LJ and fifth in the TJ. Angel Echevarria '16 claimed third in both events and Jackson Wirekoh '13 placed sixth in the LJ and fourth in the TJ.
    
    
                  
    
    Tyler Singer-Clark '14 was also a double winner, as well as anchoring both winning relays. Singer-Clark first brought the baton home in the 4x100 with a 42.70 performance despite substitutes States Lee '16 and Adrian Samsel '16 filling in for injured Michael DuPlessis '14 and Josh Duncavage '13. Singer-Clark then ran a big PR of 10.96 with a tailwind of only 2.1 mps. In the 200 he won in 22.01 and then ran a 49.0 anchor to earn the victory for Michael Kaba '16 (49.5), Richard Lu '16 (52.3) and Pat Marx '13 (50.4).
    
    
                  
    
    Kaba, on the 4x100 as well as the 4x400, ran an outstanding 54.61 debut in the 400IH for the win and placed third in the 110HH in 15.39.
    
    
                  
    
    Derek Barnes '16 led a 1-2 sweep in the 400 with a wind battered 49.36, just slightly ahead of States Lee in 49.38. Barnes was sick afterwards and unable to come back in the 200, but Lee did come back to get second in 22.24.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT dominated the 800-5K, winning all events and outscoring their opponents 45 to 15 for RPI to 6 for WPI. Pat Marx took the win in the 800, negative splitting with a 57 last 400 for a 1:57.96 performance. Harrison Hunter '15 almost held on for the win but still ran a very nice 1:58.35.
    
    
                  
    
    The 1500 was nothing but a sit and kick race and Kyle Hannon '13 buried the field with a 46 last 300, much of it into the wind to win in 4:09.27. Chadd Kiggins '15 supported with second place in 4:11.67, also running 46 in the final 300.
    
    
                  
    
    Logan Trimble '13 went out hard in the 5K, matching the pace set by early leader Justin Bullock '14 who ran 2:22 for the first 800. He then teamed up with Edgar Gridello '16 as they slowly moved up to catch Ian Tolan '16. By the 4000 mark Trimble and Gridello moved up to Tolan at 12:21. The trio worked together at that point. Trimble, who had fallen behind, gathered his pride and charged to the front to win in 15:21.51. Tolan could not quite hold the kick, but still finished well in 15:22.51. Gridello was right behind in 15:23.63. Bullock fell off his initial fast pace, finishing sixth in 15:46.20.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT hosts a trio of Maine teams; Bates College, Colby College and the University of Southern Maine. It will be a challenge for the Engineers to remain unbeaten, particularly the men as Bates has a very strong and well balanced team.

    De Geus Shines at Princeton, MIT Meet Canceled
    
    
                  
    
    April 17-20, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    The week did not start off well. On Monday, Patriots Day Holiday in Massachusetts, or Marathon Monday to most runners, two bombs went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring many. Fortunately, none of our runners were injured, nor any MIT students, staff or faculty, but it was a tragic reminder that no place is entirely safe in this day and age. How all of this would affect the MIT student-athletes would be determined.
    
    
                  
    
    On Wednesday and Thursday, our male decathletes traveled to Holy Cross in an attempt to qualify for the New England Division III Championship. Adrian Samsel '16, Jordan Mizerak '14 and Matt Falk 'G competed among 19 individuals. Samsel, very new to the event, only training for the past month, scored 5518 points and has plenty of room for improvement in two weeks. He ran 11.41 in the 100 and a season best 16:16 for the 110HH. Even though he jumped 20-1 and 5-10 in the Long Jump and High Jump, he can do much better. His 400 in 52.23 was far from his best. The experiment was good enough to have him go for it at the D3 Championship. Mizerak was having a pretty good day when he pulled his hamstring going for 13-3 in the Pole Vault. He still scored 4731 points without doing the 1500. Falk, injured most of the season, faired well in the throwing events and High Jump but that was it. He will try to focus on the High Jump for the final week to see if he can qualify for the D3 Championship and return to his scoring days of the past in that event.
    
    
                  
    
    Six individuals made the trip down to Princeton University's Larry Ellis Memorial Invitational held on Friday evening. The five hour drive was done on Thursday evening after practice so the athletes would be well rested for their Friday evening races. On the trip down, around 9:30 p.m. everyone's cell phones started going off with the messages from MIT that there was an emergency on campus and to stay away from the Stata Center. Our trip continued, as did the ensuing tragedy where the bombers shot and killed Officer Sean Collier of the MIT Police and one of the bombers was killed in the ensuing shootout. The reaction of the police and government forces was unprecedented, shutting down most of Boston and the town of Watertown where the remaining suspect was hiding. The tragedy ended on Friday night with the capture of the final suspect. While this awful tragedy was senseless, the outstanding job done by the various law enforcement agencies shows the dedication and preparedness for safety for all those concerned.
    
    
                  
    
    Another six individuals were scheduled to leave for Princeton on Friday, but given the situation were not permitted to leave MIT. In addition, the 32 team MIT Spring Invitational scheduled for Saturday was cancelled along with other home and away contests scheduled for Saturday. This was an early decision made to ensure everyone's safety.
    
    
                  
    
    The athletes at the meet in Princeton did their best to focus on the races at hand even though their thoughts and prayers were with those back at MIT. Martina de Geus '14 was the first competitor for Tech, running in one of the Elite sections of the 3000 Steeplechase. She stayed in the pack the entire race, not really racing to her full ability, but running a smart race. She started with an 85 second first lap, went with the pack as they picked up to an 83 and then an 86 before locking into 91's for the next four laps and then finishing strong with a 40 second last 200 to run a 10 second PR in 10:58.15.
    
    
                  
    
    Justin Bullock '14, scheduled to run in the open section on Saturday, was allowed to race in the Friday section given the circumstances back at MIT and the fact he would have to come back with the team Saturday morning, missing his scheduled race. He was unfortunately boxed in and involved in a lot of contact for the first half mile. When the opportunity to move was provided, Bullock was not able to move although he did run a respectable 3:58.51. He is ready to run an excellent race if he can stay out of trouble in the early parts of races.
    
    
                  
    
    The ladies in the 5K, Sarah Quinn '16, Elaine McVay '15 and Brooke Johnson '13, were expected to all break 17:00 despite the windy conditions. Things did not go as planned. Johnson was not able to finish the race due to gastrointestinal problems, dropping out after five laps of racing and coming through the 1600 in 5:20. McVay's hamstrings and quads started cramping, possibly due to electrolyte imbalances, and fell off the pace early, only able to run 17:46, just about her 5K pace in her recent 10K of 35:54.  Quinn continued to have calf problems as they seized up on her prior to the 3200 mark. She maintained a solid pace, hitting 10:46 at the 3200 mark, but then fell off dramatically, finishing in 17:33.
    
    
                  
    
    Benji Xie '15 was the final athlete to compete for the Engineers. A deluge of rain began the section before Xie's and continued throughout his race. Xie's goal was to run sub 14:30, but it did not appear he had mentally bought into the effort that would take. He went out with the leaders, actually in second position, hitting 70 for each of the first four laps, instead of the 69 second 400's necessary to achieve his goal. As he slid further back in the pack, Xie slowed to 74 second laps shortly after the 9:26 3200 to hit the 4800 in 14:19. Finishing at the same pace, Xie ran 14:56.63.
    
    
                  
    
    With the NEWMAC Conference Championship on hand for the upcoming weekend and the New England Division III Championship the week after, the MIT Engineers need to get their focus back for the tasks at hand or their string of championship victories could be at an end.

    TWO VARSITY AND ONE FRESHMAN RECORD START THINGS OFF FOR MIT AT NATIONALS
    
    
                  
    
    May 23-25, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    MIT took 15 individuals to the NCAA Division III Track & Field Championship hosted by the University of Wisconsin La Crosse. Eight women and seven men represented the Engineers. The men were entered in both relays; the 4x100 and 4x400, the 200, 400, 400IH and 800. The women were entered in the Heptathlon, Pole Vault, Javelin, 1500, 3000 Steeplechase, 5K and 10K. To be selected for these championships one had to be among the 20 best men per event, the 22 best women per event or one of the top 16 relay teams among the 400+ Division III colleges in the country. 
    
    
                  
    
    On the first of three days of competition, Jackie Konopka '14 started things off for MIT, and she did so in a new personal best of 14.83 in the 100HH, the third best time in the 22 member field. She proceeded to jump 5-3, throw the shot 31-1 and run the 200 in 26.77 to end up in 11th place with 2826 points at the end of day one of the two day event.
    
    
                  
    
    The men were up next in the 4x100 Relay. Michael DuPlessis '14, Michael Kaba '16, Josh Duncavage '13 and Tyler Singer-Clark '14 were racing together for the second time, having just qualified for this meet last weekend and were seeded 13th entering the meet. The top two teams in each of the three sections and the next three fastest times would make the nine team final. DuPlessis got out well and seemed to out sprint his competitors. At the exchange he was reaching and not sprinting through the handoff, making it too close for comfort, but little speed was lost as Kaba got the baton. Kaba ran an excellent backstretch and MIT was dominating the event. At the handoff to Duncavage, Kaba caught him too early, causing a loss of speed, but the team was still racing well. The handoff to Singer-Clark was solid and the anchor did his thing, moving past one or two competitors down the homestretch to give MIT second place in their heat in 41.29, automatically qualifying for Saturday's final. Their performance was also a new MIT record.
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's Pole Vault, MIT had two entries, Lauren Kuntz '13 and Cimmy Virdi '16. Kuntz was the national runner-up indoors and was seeded fifth going into this competition. Virdi barely made the field of 22, but had the potential to do well. Four vaulters went out at the first height and four more at the second height, both of which Virdi made on her first attempts. At 12-1 1/2 Virdi missed all three attempts, finishing in ninth place, one out of the scoring and All America honors. Kuntz did not have her best day. Whether the fact that the MIT poles had been damaged in shipping bothered her or she could not find the right pole to handle her greater speed due to the tailwind, the fact was that she missed all three attempts at her opening height, thus no heighting even though she was ready to vault very well. It was a difficult way for the senior vaulter, who had accomplished so much for MIT, to end her collegiate career.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's 1500 was up next on the track, and both Brooke Johnson '13 and Sarah Quinn '16 were representing MIT. Johnson, seeded 10th, was in the first heat and Quinn, seeded 18th, was racing in the second heat. The final field would be made up of the top four from each heat and the next four fastest times. As predicted, the first heat went out slowly as the top seed took the lead and slowed everything down as she was trying to save energy so that she could compete favorably in the 800 and 5K later in the meet. Johnson was prepared for this scenario and just bided her time, waiting for the kick that would likely happen in the final 600 meters. The 800 split was 2:34 as things started to pick up. Johnson ran the next 400 in 71 as she broke out with a group of six. She covered the final 300 in 50 to just finish in the top four, passing through to the finals. It was a good thing Johnson had her kick, because the slow early pace was going to keep everyone not in the top four out of the finals. The second heat made sure of this by taking the pace out in 70 for the first quarter. Even though the pace slowed to 74 for the next two quarters, the second heat still came through 1200 eight seconds faster than heat one. Quinn was right at the front and mistakenly took the lead with about 250 to go instead of waiting another hundred meters. Her move, as well as her failure to relax in the early part of the race caused her to tighten up in the final 100, losing places, but still qualifying on time for the final with a new MIT rookie record of 4:32.19.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up for MIT was the 400IH. Kaba was seeded sixth, but with his inability to use his non-dominant leg and the fact he was too fast to go 15 steps between hurdles and not fast enough to go 13 steps, meant he would need a vicious head wind on the backstretch to do well. Earlier in the day this was the case, but by race time the wind had died down. Sure enough Kaba was stutter stepping each hurdle as he was just too close each time. He had plenty of speed and energy remaining on the home stretch but no ability to use it. His 53.08 was a fine time under the circumstances, but had him in 11th place, two places out of the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Singer-Clark was up again, this time in the 200, an event in which he was seeded sixth at 21.37. He stood up slightly at the start, not pushing back as well as he should, but he ran a solid race, screaming down the home stretch to place third in his heat in 21.57. He just missed finals, placing 10th, one hundredth of a second behind the final qualifier.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's 10K was next and the ninth seeded Elaine McVay '15 was ready to race despite her four exams, three in the past 36 hours. A group of three broke away at a suicidal pace of 81 second quarters. The remainder of the pack settled in a pretty fast pace of 85 second quarters and McVay was in this pack. After a first mile of 5:39 the second pack started splitting up a bit but McVay looked to be running effortlessly towards the front of the chase group. Her second 1600 was 5:43 as was the third as things continued to thin out. In the fourth 1600, which was 5:49 it was clear McVay was feeling good, but hesitant to move ahead of her group of seven, which was now catching up to the leaders. If McVay had made her move with seven laps to go she may have been able to win the race, but she was unaware of how close the leader actually was to the chase group. The fifth 1600 was 5:55, mostly because McVay was just staying with the dying pack. In the meantime two of the three in the lead pack were coming back fast. The chase group started moving and so did McVay, dropping a 5:43 sixth mile and closing with an 81 to move into third place with an overall time of 35:53.33, just 11 seconds out of first and a new PR.
    
    
                  
    
    Martina de Geus '14 was the sixth seed in the 3000 Steeplechase and feeling great about making finals and being an All America winner. The first 1600 was a quick 5:41, but de Geus looked like she was taking a stroll in the park and feeling comfortable. With 1000 meters to go, de Geus went over the water jump and landed awkwardly, doing damage to her knee. Falling off the pace badly, and limping through the final two laps, she finished with a very disappointing 11:12.12.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event of the evening was the men's 4x400 and the fourth seeded team from MIT was pretty sure they would make the finals. The three freshmen; States Lee '16, Derek Barnes '16 and Kaba, joined Singer-Clark to test their skills against the best in the country. Lee led off and certainly did the job, burying a 47.8 lead off to give MIT the lead over the top seed from Augustana and the rest of the field in heat two. Kaba's handoff could have been a bit better, but overall was much better than when the team qualified for this event two weeks prior. Kaba maintained the lead, running a 47.8 of his own as he handed off to Barnes. This handoff was much improved. Barnes held the lead through 300 meters but tightened up in the homestretch, giving up the lead to Augustana, but still running 48.6. Singer-Clark took off too early on the dying Barnes and had to slow down to get the baton, losing some valuable ground. Once Singer-Clark got running he did a good job of holding onto second and even closing on Augustana. In the final few meters Singer-Clark was passed by another team, but finished in third in a new MIT record of 3:11.91. Singer-Clark's split was 47.6 and could have been sub 47 with a solid handoff. The quartet made the finals on Saturday and are looking for an even better finish.
    
    
                  
    
    Friday was light, but pretty significant. Konopka knew she would need a big long jump in order to move into scoring position from her current 11th place. However, it was not to be as she went 16-3 1/2 when she needed something in the 17's. With her injured elbow she was not able to get anything of significance in the Javelin, falling to 20th place. Konopka finished with an okay 2:34.67 800 to finish with 4282 points.
    
    
                  
    
    States Lee was seeded 20th out of 20 in the 400, but was way too competitive to live with that seed. Going out in 22.8 and perhaps waiting too long to make a move, he brought it home well to finish 12th overall in 48.34.
    
    
                  
    
    The event of the day for MIT was the men's 800. Pat Marx '13 was also seeded 20th out of 20. The first heat ran a strategic race, a foolish thing to do in the 800, a race where the top two in each of three sections plus the next three fastest times would make finals. The top time from that first section was in the 1:52's, a time that almost never makes it in. Marx was in the second heat and after the runners saw they might be able to get all of the qualifying times outside the top two places the pace started off fast. The leaders came through the 400 in 51., while Marx was a little behind but close enough, running 52.8. Marx moved up on the backstretch and then really accelerated mid-way through the final turn. Coming home he moved into second and held on to automatically qualify in 1:50.87, the third fastest time in the field, and a new PR.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT had athletes in six finals on Saturday, the final day of the championship. The first event on MIT's list was the 4x100 Relay. Already moving from 13th seed to seventh fastest in the trials, hopes were high. With adjustments to both exchange one and two, the Engineers were hoping for perfection on the handoffs. Tech had a good start, but on the first exchange Kaba did not hear DuPlessis call for the handoff. Nevertheless the second call worked, although MIT did lose a bit of time on the handoff. The second exchange between Kaba and Duncavage was also slow as Kaba ran up on Duncavage despite moving the start out a step. The final handoff was solid and Singer-Clark held his own but could not pass any of the teams, finishing in sixth in a new MIT record of 41.06.
    
    
                  
    
    The very next event was the women's 1500. While neither Johnson, nor Quinn were expected to score, both thought they had a good chance. However, the fast pace was the worst thing for Quinn's calves and Johnson's confidence. Quinn deserves a lot of credit for never giving up and fighting as hard as she did given the lack of training over the past four months due to her injured calves. The first quarter was 69 and the 800 at 2:19, yet Quinn was right there in the thick of it. At 1200 her calves were tightening up, but she kept pushing through 3:33, but that was the end of the line for the freshman. Her final 300 was a 61 second death, but she still netted a 4:34.30. Johnson was not mentally prepared for the pace, and although she came through the 800 in 2:21, she had already given up and checked out. Her final time was 4:45.29.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor '15 was up in the Javelin, seeded 12th, but hoping for a big throw to move up. Her best throw in the first flight was 131-8, getting her fourth in her flight. Unfortunately, the top seven throws in the trials came from the second flight, placing Taylor in 11th overall and out of the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Marx was mentally ready for the 800 final, but could not overcome his habits of the past three years. He got out well, but did not move up with the leaders, instead he settled near the back of the pack rather than closing the gap. At the 300 mark he moved to fix his position but did not finish it, falling back more as runners passed him on the inside. After the 55.1 first 400, Marx made a strong move on the turn, moving up in the pack by swinging wide to lane three, but then settled back again, allowing opponents to pass him. He sped up again, but was now too fatigued to get the job done, fading to ninth on the final straight, ending up with a 1:52.53.
    
    
                  
    
    Johnson was back in the 5K. Seeded 22nd, not a lot was expected, but her potential was enough to put her in scoring position. However, her failure in the 1500 set her up for failure in the 5,000. The pace started out perfect for sub 17:00 pace as the pack clicked through 81 second quarters. Johnson hit 5:25 at the 1600 and looked strong. After the 2K, she pulled the parachute, giving up the race. Her final time was 17:46.19
    
    
                  
    
    The Men's 4x400 was what the team was really looking forward to. Despite the three freshmen on the squad, their inexperience did not appear to get in the way of their amazing talent. States Lee tore out of lane three, dropping a 47.5 to put MIT at least tied for first at the handoff to Michael Kaba. Kaba got out pretty well, but did not push hard enough to take the lead at the break from the three turn stagger, instead was stuck in fifth and boxed on the outside by the sixth place runner. He had to cut his pace to get out and lost a lot of energy, and time trying to get back. He nearly pulled even at the exchange, but only ran 48.5. Derek Barnes got out well, putting MIT in third. The runner behind him was crowding his lane and seemed to touch his foot with his leg, causing Barnes to trip and hit the ground hard. He rolled and recovered pretty well but still lost four seconds to run a 52.7, handing off to Singer-Clark in eighth place. Singer-Clark pulled even with the seventh place team, but despite a 47.2 leg was unable to move his team up. The 3:15.85 placed MIT eighth, getting the quartet All America honors.
    
    
                  
    
    All in all, the two varsity records, one freshman record and the invaluable experience made the NCAA Championship a great event for MIT. Nevertheless, there was the feeling of unfinished business. Even though Tech finished higher than their seed in many cases,  only three of the 13 events represented earned All-America honors (top eight).

    WOMEN TAKE NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III CROWN WHILE MEN TAKE SECOND, LOSING BY 1 POINT
    
    
                  
    
    May 3-4, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    At the New England Division III Championship, hosted by Colby College in Waterville, Maine, MIT was seeded first on the women's side of the ledger while the men were seeded third going into the competition. For the men, Tufts was seeded to score 123 points to 95 for Bates and 69 for MIT. The women were seeded to score 127 to 109 for Tufts. MIT competed with the intent of winning both.
    
    
                  
    
    The first event for the men was the Decathlon. Adrian Samsel '16 was seeded 10th based on the rookie's only attempt at the event back in April. Samsel broke out of the gates with some great performances on day one, including a 21-4 3/4 effort in the Long Jump, and at the end of those five events he was in first place. Samsel and everyone else knew that day two included events he was just learning, particularly the Discus, Javelin and Pole Vault. By the end of nine events he had dropped to sixth place. The final event, the 1500 is a pretty solid event for Samsel, but he went with the leader, which took him out to a 31 first 200, which pretty much ended hopes of him moving up  in the overall score. He held on pretty well, running 4:34 for the 1500, but this dropped him to seventh place. He was only 61 points out of fourth, which a 4:27 would have secured. Nevertheless it was a new freshman record for MIT in the Decathlon and two more points than the team counted on. Unfortunately for MIT, Bates College earned first and fourth for a solid 15 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The only other event in which MIT scored on day one was the 10K. Tech had five entries in the event and hoped to have all of them score (top 8) although with the talented field this was asking a lot. The pace started out ridiculously slow, over 90 second 400 pace through the 200, but then it picked up a bit to hit 83 at the 400, the exact same pace as the women's 10K. All five MIT runners were up at the front, biding their time through the first mile at 5:15 the second mile at 5:08 and the third mile at 5:09. Towards the end of the fourth mile the pace dropped to a 73 400, but when that did not shake up the top nine runners, Allen Leung '15 and Matt Jordan '15 took over the lead, settling back to 76-77 pace. With eight scoring places and nine runners still in contention it was time to shake things up. The fourth mile was 5:03, but it was not until the end of the fifth mile when the pace really picked up going into the final lap of the fifth mile as the leader dropped a 72 for a 4:59 mile. Benji Xie '15 went with the leader as the nine split up very quickly. Roy Wedge '14 sort of hung off the leaders, never more than three seconds back from second place. Leung was back in fifth-sixth, losing about five seconds per quarter as he was running 75's while the leaders were pushing 70's. Jordan and Matt Deyo '16 were fighting it out with a Bates runner for seventh, eighth and ninth. In the final lap Wedge showed the determination that won him the title as a freshman as he dropped a 63 to go from fourth to second in 31:24.53. Xie got nipped at the line by Wedge and a Williams runner, placing fourth in 31:25.62. Leung was unable to muster a kick but finished a solid sixth in 31:47.08. Jordan, who had fallen off, pulled a Wedge like kick of his own (65) to squeak into eighth place in 31:49.53. Deyo just missed scoring, finishing ninth in 31:49.65. Bates pulled down first and seventh for 12 points. MIT grabbed 17 points. At the end of day one MIT was looking at a 42-19 deficit.
    
    
                  
    
    For the women the start was a little stronger. The two day Heptathlon event is conducted on Friday and Saturday, unlike the Decathlon, which is Thursday and Friday. Jackie Konopka '14, the top seed had a solid first day, sporting performances of 15.35 in the 100HH, 5-3 1/4 in the High Jump, 32-3 3/4 in the Shot Put and a 26.99 into the wind in the 200. This had her easily locked into first place entering day two.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor '15, suffering from a groin injury, was having trouble maintaining her speed in the crossover part of the approach in the Javelin throw. This and a lack of emotion had her in second place entering the final round of competition. She was passed early in the round to fall back to third. This seemed to wake her up as she added four meters to her mark with a 138-9 throw for second place. She had been seeded third so the additional two points was important.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Long Jump, an event in which MIT was not expected to score, both Michelle Johnson '15 and Jackie Brew '14 made the nine person final even though their marks were 16-9 3/4 and 16-5 3/4 respectively. Johnson, in fifth at the start of finals, kept getting passed and was unable to improve her mark as she finished in eighth. Brew improved to 16-8, but remained in ninth. 
    
    
                  
    
    Elaine McVay '15 was seeded first in the 10K, but was in question with a hamstring that had continued to cramp up on her even on general runs. She declared herself ready to go and had the mind set to get the job done. Right at the start McVay and two other runners pulled away from the field, running a 5:38 first mile. MIT's other three runners followed the plan, which was for Kaitlin Allen '14 to run 91 second 400's and for Shivani Kaushal '15 and Kali Benavides '15 to run 92's. Allen found herself moving up steadily through the pack although she was running more like 89-90 pace. The second mile for the leaders was a 5:42 and McVay looked great. However, during the third mile her hamstring again cramped, forcing her to slow and lose contact with the two leaders. Allen continued to run with two others, vying for sixth, seventh and eighth positions. McVay held onto third place in a respectable 36:22.25 performance. Allen was unable to out kick the others but managed eighth place in 37:39.64. Although they did not score, Kaushal's 38:33.45 and Benavides's 38:48.20 were very strong performances.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two was incredible in many respects. First, the men fell ridiculously far behind, at one point trailing 73-19 as Bates went 1-2 in the Discus, and 1-6 in the Steeplechase in two early events without MIT scoring a point. That is where the tide began to turn. First on the track, the quartet of Michael DuPlessis '14, Michael Kaba '16, Nick Diamantoni '15 and Tyler Singer-Clark '14 ran a 41.91 from lane eight, never seeing their opponents, to win the title. This was despite poor handoffs on both ends of Kaba's leg as he left late on the front end and put the baton out too early on the back end. Unfortunately Diamantoni pulled his hamstring slowing down too quickly, but Josh Duncavage '13 is back to full health so the Engineers may not miss a beat.
    
    
                  
    
    Bates picked up two in the 4x100 and then came back with a strong third in the 1500, an event in which MIT did not score, giving Bates 81 to 29 for MIT. Up on the horizontal jumps area, some freshman magic was taking place as Arinze Okeke '16 defied gravity to improve by over a meter to take first place at 47-04 1/4. Carrington Motley '16 had a nice PR of his own, jumping 47-3 for second place. Yet another freshman, Angel Echevarria, had a personal best of 44-9 1/2 for eighth place and a nice 19 point event. Okeke's mark was a new freshman record. 
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, Singer-Clark remained undefeated for the season, taking the 100 in 10.98. He was supported by DuPlessis with a second place 11.08. Josh Duncavage added a fifth place with an 11.21 after running 11.14 in the trials. Bates did no score in the 100 or Triple Jump, but did add points in the 110HH, where MIT hoped to score, but did not. The score now stood at 70 for MIT and 90 for Bates. 
    
    
                  
    
    In the 400, again MIT was depending on freshmen to get the job done. MIT was seeded for nine points, but States Lee '16 would have none of that. Lee defended his indoor title while lowering the MIT freshman record to 48.20. Teammate Derek Barnes '16, the former freshman record holder, placed fifth in 48.91. Bates did not score and now MIT was only 6 down.
    
    
                  
    
    The 400IH had the potential to be a big event for MIT, but it did not quite work out that way. Michael Kaba continued to have a rough day as he was probably warming up for too long and out in the sun much too long. He struggled to get his step to the hurdles on each one but still somehow managed to run 54.38 for sixth place. 
    
    
                  
    
    So with still being 3 down and the 800 coming up with Bates having three runners in the seeded section the feeling was MIT had to draw a line in the sand. Pat Marx '13 did just that, running a 1:52.33 to take third place while Bates only managed fourth. Marx ran a perfect race to set a season best.
    
    
                  
    
    With opportunities getting less and less, MIT was inspired by Marx's effort. Singer-Clark, Lee and Barnes took care of business in 200. Barnes won the section fastest section in 22.23 and Singer-Clark won his third event with a season best, and tying his personal best in 21.62. Lee earned fourth place in 22.22. The 19 points gave MIT 112 to 95 for Bates and the first lead of the meet.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Pole Vault, MIT got a superb performance from Ben Schreck '15, who added a foot to his MIT mark, clearing 15-3 for sixth place. Cyrus Vafadari placed third, also at 15-3 while Bates earned eight points, thus adding one more point to the lead.
    
    
                  
    
    The 5K was next on the track, but while that was going on, Bates was adding a 1-2 finish in the Shot Put for 18 points to tie the score at 121 to 121. MIT had six competitors in the 5K while Bates had two, but their two were seeded higher and were both fresh, while MIT's top seeds were all coming back from the 10K the day before. Benji Xie stuck to the leaders despite an injury he had been enduring for a couple of months and the obvious fatigue from the 10K. The other MIT runners were game but could not stick with the top eight past the half-way mark. Xie ran an excellent and gutsy 14:52.07 for third place, but Bates took second and fourth to give them 134 to 127 for MIT with only the relays to go.
    
    
                  
    
    With very few opportunities to run 4x800 relays in the spring and the rule being that all seeded times have to come from the outdoor season, many good teams were in the unseeded section while Bates and MIT were pretty much uncontested in the fast section. Bowdoin College had a loaded team in the unseeded section and with no competition ran 7:41.86. MIT knew they needed to finish no worse than one team behind Bates and were aware of what Bowdoin had done in the first section. Bates simply had more firepower and ran an incredibly inspired 7:40.10 to take first place. MIT did their best, with Sam Parker '15 running 1:56.2, Jared Forman '13 1:57.8, Harrison Hunter '15 1:58.9 and Marx going out in 52.4 but only finishing in 1:57.7 for a cumulative time of 7:50.89. MIT did finish third overall, which put them 11 behind with one event to go, making it impossible to win the meet.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event, the 4x400 relay, Tech was still hoping there was a miscount in the score, so were going for it nevertheless. They were not at their best after a long day under very sunny skies, but Kaba (49.6), Lee (49.0), Barnes (50.1) and Singer-Clark (48.2) did run 3:17.26 for the victory. Bates did not score and left with a one point victory. Tufts finished a distant third with 71 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's meet was exciting for most of the meet, but did not quite bring the same drama as the men's meet. To set the story, Tufts was very strong in the throws and pretty strong in the sprints. They had balance elsewhere but almost nothing in the middle distance and distance events, which was MIT's strength.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two began with the continuation of the Heptathlon, which Konopka continued to dominate. Her long jump of 15-8 1/4 was nearly a foot off her best, but her Javelin was a season best of 93-6 and her 800 was an excellent 2:29.78 to give her a total of 4420 points, just off the MIT record of 4431.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT tried to score in the 100 and 4x100, but were unable to do so. Jackie Brew '14 did make finals in the 100HH, taking the final position in the finals. In the finals she was unable to move up but did gain MIT a point.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's strength is on the oval and that was about to be known. First, in the 3000 Steeplechase, Martina de Geus '14 ran a strong and steady race for a 10:52.03 PR, good for second place.
    
    
                  
    
    Brooke Johnson '13 was about to do her one better. In the 1500, Johnson, Sarah Quinn '16 and Louise van den Heuvel '14 went out in a safe, but reasonable 76 quarter and 2:30 800. Johnson moved at this point with a 71, stringing out the field as no one was ready for the move. She closed in 52 for the final 300 as she was still speeding up when she crossed the line in 4:33.05 for the victory. Quinn, whose calves have been having problems since early February, still placed fifth in 4:36.63, while van den Heuvel followed in sixth in a personal best 4:36.79.
    
    
                  
    
    Tufts gained points in the Hammer and Discus as well as the Shot Put, putting up 38 points in those events while MIT earned five. Isabella Stuopis '16 pushed up her MIT rookie record and moved up her seed by throwing 41-8 1/2. Christine Labaza '14 just missed scoring in both the Shot Put and Discus.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Tufts won the 4x100 Relay as well as earned 12 points in the High Hurdles. They also earned five in the 100 and eight in the 400IH. MIT was in a hole and with only the Pole Vault, Triple Jump, 800, 5K and 4x800 to go for scoring opportunities.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers got to work. In the Triple Jump, Michelle Johnson took fourth place with a leap of 36-7 3/4. In the Pole Vault, in typical fashion, MIT pulled down 19 points as Lauren Kuntz '13 took first with a 12-7 1/2 jump. Her teammates, Cimmy Virdi '16 placed third at 11-7 3/4 while Sherry Wan '16 finished in sixth with a personal best 11-1 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Alexandra Taylor '14 ran a season best of 2:15.20 to place fourth in the 800. Tufts scored, but only earned two points to MIT's five. 
    
    
                  
    
    Going into the 5K and final two relay events, MIT was down by 1/2 point to Tufts. Without knowing how the relays would break for Tufts, MIT went with their six entries, five of which were doubling back from the 1500, 3000 Steeplechase and 10K. The only fresh body was Nicole Zeinstra '16 and her quads and calves were tightening up on her with every run. Brooke Johnson, Elaine McVay and Sarah Quinn were set to take the lead and run 83 second quarters against the relatively weak field while Martina de Geus, Zeinstra and Kaitlin Allen were planning to run 85's. For the first two miles the top group did their job with McVay yielding slightly to her cramping leg. At that point they had over a 100 meter lead and no one was gaining. Allen was too fatigued from the 10K and was unable to hang with her group. At 3200 meters Zeinstra was holding on but de Geus felt great, relatively speaking, and moved the pace up slightly. Johnson, Quinn and McVay all cruised in 1-2-3 (17:31.05, 17:43.50, 17:46.96 respectively) with de Geus close behind in fourth at 17:52.13. Zeinstra managed a nice kick down the final straight to take seventh in 18:11.62. MIT totaled 31 points to seal the victory.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT did not enter the 4x400 with the victory in hand. In the 4x800, the quartet of Cindy Huang '15, van den Heuvel, Margaret Coad '15 and Taylor nearly set an MIT record as they placed third in 9:14.56. Huang split 2:17.4, van den Heuvel a PR 2:18.0, Coad a 2:22.6 and Taylor anchoring a 2:16.3.
    
    
                  
    
    The final tally was MIT 126.5 to 93 for Tufts. Host Colby earned third with 78 points just three points up on Williams.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, at the All Division New England Championship hosted by Stonehill College, MIT will reduce its squad down to those who have a shot at going to the NCAA Division III Championship in three weeks.

    Two Varsity Records Fall as Engineers set NCAA Qualifying Marks
    
    
                  
    
    May 10-11, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    With two meets left to achieve qualifying performances, MIT traveled to Stonehill College for the NEICAAA Championship, a meet that brings together most of the Division I, II and III teams in New England. MIT did not compete any of their distance runners even though the competition in those events tends to be pretty weak. Instead the distance runners took the week off from racing after such a monster effort last weekend. For Tech, this meet is about getting qualifying performances for Nationals by competing against the best competition in New England.
    
    
                  
    
    Two MIT records fell during the competition and Michael Kaba was part of both of them. The freshman star qualified for the finals of the 400IH with a 53.50 performance on Friday. This performance was a personal best and very easy as he relaxed and 15 stepped the entire way. On Saturday Kaba was going to try and hit 14 steps for the first four hurdles, but did not bring enough speed off the first hurdle to enable that. He stuttered to hit 15 and continued that for the next three hurdles. Once he started running into the wind, that all changed as he was able to hit 15 without stuttering and really brought it home, passing all but one of the elite runners, finishing second in 52.20. This should certainly be fast enough to make the NCAA Division III Championship.
    
    
                  
    
    The 4x400 record of 3:12.70 is talked about with great reverence around MIT. For three freshmen and a junior to entertain taking that record down borders on track and field blasphemy. The foursome had a very busy weekend before going into the final race of the competition. States Lee '16 had run trials in the 400 (48.90), Derek Barnes '16 ran trials and finals in the 400 (48.79, 50.40), Michael Kaba '16, ran the 4x100 Relay, and the 400IH trials and finals, and Tyler Singer-Clark '14 ran the 4x100 Relay and trials and finals in the 400 (48.56, 48.87). Going into the race, knowing they were tired, it was decided the quartet would no longer worry about time but just go for the win. The adrenaline sparked by the competitive spirit of this group was all they needed. Lee led off, and set the wheels in motion as he ran an excellent 47.9 leg. Unfortunately, Kaba did not get out well, making the handoff nearly a still start. There was no way to tell he had recently run the 400IH final as after a moderate first 100, Kaba lit it up, actually taking the lead on the field with a 47.6 leg. As poorly as Kaba got out for the handoff, Barnes was worse, literally making it a stand still start. Barnes did race well despite having to get his momentum going while the Southern Connecticut and UMass Lowell runners were already in high gear. Barnes finished his leg in a respectable 48.9. Singer-Clark moved on the opposition and on the homestretch moved into second, but could not quite catch Southern. Singer-Clark's leg was 47.8, giving Tech a 3:12.42 performance despite the nearly two seconds lost in awful handoffs (the third handoff was not spectacular either). At the time they ran it, this time put them in fourth on the NCAA Division III performance list.
    
    
                  
    
    Martina de Geus '14, despite a pretty stressful week, raced the 3000 Steeplechase more aggressively than ever before. Going out at 79 for the first 400 and never hitting a 400 slower than 88 despite the four barriers plus waterjump every lap, de Geus ran a 14 second PR of 10:38.58, 30 seconds faster than her best previous to this year. She is currently ranked fifth on the NCAA list. Her 40 second final 200 with a waterjump and one barrier says she still has quite a bit left.
    
    
                  
    
    Brooke Johnson '13 was in the 1500 and hoped to make it three wins in as many weekends in the event. The seeded section went out in 72 for the first quarter and Johnson was in a great position towards the front of the pack. The pace slowed to 2:28 and the pack grouped up tighter. The pace opened up a bit to 71 for the third quarter and Johnson moved up to third place. In the final quarter Johnson moved to second, but despite her 50 seconds for the final 300 she was passed in the final meters to finish third in 4:30.75. Johnson is now ranked ninth on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    The 4x100 Relay was expecting to get into the low to mid 41's, but substituting Josh Duncavage '13 for the injured Nick Diamantoni '15 meant it would be the first time the four had run together. Michael DuPlessis '13 ran a great leg, but his sore calves did impact his speed. The handoff to Kaba was excellent and helped mitigate DuPlessis's speed. Kaba ran a strong leg and had a decent handoff to Duncavage. Duncavage is coming off a hamstring injury that still has him running cautiously. His leg was okay, but not his best, allowing the teams to catch up a bit. The handoff to Singer-Clark was solid and the anchor did his job, moving past everyone and nearly catching the leader, just missing by .02 as MIT ran 41.93.
    
    
                  
    
    The dependable Pole Vault went well for MIT although no one set personal bests or moved up on the NCAA list. Ben Schreck '15 continued his winning battle on the mental side, tying for third at 15-3. Yida Gao '13 jumped 14-9 but did not place. Lauren Kuntz '13, favored to win, was not quite at the top of her game, but still placed third at 12-5 1/2. Cimmy Virdi '16 finished in a tie for sixth at 11-5 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    The only other scoring place for MIT was earned by Carrtington Motley '16 in the Triple Jump. Motley placed eighth in 45-10.
    
    
                  
    
    Isabella Stuopis '16 improved her PR and freshman record to 42-10 3/4, just missing placing by one position. Sam Parker '15 ran a season best in the 800 of 1:53.43.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT will take a few folks to the ECAC Division III Championship hosted by Springfield College on May 16-17. Those going will be trying to improve on their NCAA marks with hopes of making the big dance at the University of Wisconsin La Cross May 23-25.

    BOTH MEN AND WOMEN DOMINATE NEWMAC'S TO EXTEND CHAMPIONSHIP STREAK
    
    
                  
    
    April 27, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    Going for their 14th New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) in succession, the men traveled to host Springfield College on a perfect weather day of 70 degree sunny skies and mild breezes, getting the job done with a winning total of 290 points. Second place went to WPI with 215, third to Coast Guard with 114, fourth to Springfield with 91, fifth to Babson with 35 and Wheaton College finished sixth with 26 points. The women were going for their fifth in a row and were also successful, taking the title with 228.5 points. Wheaton College was second with 153, followed by Springfield with 102.5, WPI with 91, Smith with 67, Wellesley with 51, Coast Guard with 45, Mt. Holyoke with 22 and Babson with 20.
    
    
                  
    
    The men were well aware that WPI would be the closest threat and knew that WPI's dominance would primarily be in the throwing events, so expected to be behind early in the meet. This indeed was the case as WPI outscored MIT 72-17 in the four throwing events. In those events, Harry Rein '15 of MIT placed second in the Javelin and qualified for the New England Division III Championship next week with a 171-5 effort. Alex Noakes '16 placed fifth in the Discus and Curtis Shoyer '16 earned third in the Javelin. The jumps went MIT's way, but not overwhelmingly so as Tech scored 69 points to WPI's 52. In the Long Jump, Triple Jump and Pole Vault all four entries for MIT scored. The rules of the meet are that every team has a four entry limit per event. The scoring for men and women was 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 for each event.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT did not win any of the field events, but took second in the Pole Vault, Long Jump and Triple Jump. Cyrus Vafadari '13 led the way for the Engineers in the vault, clearing 15-1 and losing on misses. Ben Schreck '15 earned third at 14-1 1/4, Yida Gao '13 took fourth at the same height and Marshall Wentworth '16 claimed sixth at 13-1 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    Carrington Motley '16 and Arinze Okeke '16 took second and third respectively in the Long Jump, both jumping PR's of 21-7 1/2. Jackson Wirekoh '13 also jumped a season best, taking fourth at 20-8 and Angel Echevarria '16 had a season best for sixth with 20-5. The same quartet returned in the Triple Jump but changed the order of finish a bit. Echevarria took second with a PR of 44-3 1/4 and Motley claimed third just behind at 44-0 1/2. Okeke placed fifth with a leap of 42-7 and Wirekoh finished in sixth at 42-1 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Coming out of the field events WPI had a 124 to 81 lead. This was okay because MIT won all but three running events and could have won all but one, totaling 209 points for Tech on the track despite getting DQ' d in the 4x400 Relay due to an overzealous maneuver by DJ Ronde '13 when he cut in on a Coast Guard runner in the first turn of the third leg.
    
    
                  
    
    Tyler Singer-Clark '14 continued to be unbeaten since the Spring Trip, winning the 100 (10.98, but 10.89 in trials) and 200 (21.95) while also anchoring the 4x100 Relay (States Lee '16, Michael Kaba '16, Nick Diamantoni '15) to victory in a season best 42.52. Supporting Singer-Clark in the 100, Michael DuPlessis '14 placed third in 11.18 (11.08 in trials) and Josh Duncavage '13 finished fifth in 11.26 (11.21 in trials). For both DuPlessis and Duncavage it was their first race of the season. In the 200 Diamantoni pulled out of the event as well as the 400 due to a very bad chest cold, but Lee and Derek Barnes '16 added a second and a third in 22.38 and 22.44.
    
    
                  
    
    Lee finally took down fellow freshman Barnes in the 400 as he won the event in 49.11. Barnes slipped to third in 49.61. MIT also took seventh with Mac Gager '14 running 51.35.
    
    
                  
    
    Michael Kaba almost had as strong a day as Singer-Clark. In addition to being on the winning 4x100 team, Kaba won the 400IH in a MIT freshman and meet record 53.63. In the 110 High Hurdles he took second place in another MIT freshman record in 14.94. For his efforts Kaba was honored with the NEWMAC Male Rookie of the Year Award. Adrian Samsel '16 supported Kaba in both events, earning fifth in the High Hurdles with a PR of 15.90 and taking third in the 400IH with a 55.36 performance. Another freshman, Richard Lu, added fourth place in the 400IH at 56.15.
    
    
                  
    
    The 800 was Tech's only 1-2-3-4 sweep and was a thing of beauty. Sam Parker '15, competing for the first time this season due to injury, had to race out of the slower section due to having no time. He knew he needed a fast time in order to get into next week's fast section at the New England Division III Championship. He basically ran a time trial, going out in 55, but with no one to race he slowed even though he was feeling strong, but still managed a solid 1:55.55. The fast section went out slower, but thanks to Chadd Kiggins '15 it was fast enough at 56 seconds. Pat Marx '13 took over with three hundred to go, pulling away to win in 1:53.21. Kiggins held on to claim second in 1:55.23 and Harrison Hunter '15 took fourth overall in 1:55.76. Parker's time earned him third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Kyle Hannon '13 was injured and not able to finish the 1500, but Justin Bullock '14 claimed the victory in a PR of 3:55.62 as he led from start to finish. Bullock went out in 61, but slowed to 2:06. He picked it up a bit to 3:10, but was still not pushing the pace. Fortunately he finished with a 45 final 300, but it was obvious he is back and ready to run fast. Jay McKenna '14 added a fourth in 4:03.12 and Ian Tolan '16 took seventh in 4:09.66.
    
    
                  
    
    Logan Trimble '13 ran a personal best en route to victory in the 3000 Steeplechase. Trimble also led from start to finish, going out in 72 for the first 400, slowing to 80 in the middle and then closing well in 35 seconds over the final 200. He can most definitely run faster if necessary, and it will be necessary next week. Edgar Gridello '16, running for the first time this season, and his first steeple ever, placed fourth in 9:53.19. Gridello showed outstanding water jumps but poor hurdling as he continually got too close to the barriers. Eric Safai '14 earned eighth after giving up due to a fast start, which he was unable to hold on this particular day.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 10K, the first running event of the meet, Matt Deyo '16 and Allen Leung '15 followed the leaders who were gracious enough to take the pace through 1600's of 5:20, 5:18, 5:19 and 5:18 before taking the lead. Leung took control, running 5:12 and then 5:05 before Deyo closed in 73 to win in 32:45.69. Leung claimed second in 32:48.38.
    
    
                  
    
    With the meet in hand and 10K's and 5K's looming for next Friday and Saturday, the only purpose of the 5K for MIT was for Roy Wedge '14 to qualify for next week's Championship. Benji Xie '15 and Matt Jordan '15 set out to help Wedge achieve his goal and then back off once they felt they were having to work hard. Anthony Salvucci '13 of Springfield did the work of setting the early pace at 72 seconds per 400 and after the halfway point in the race, put on a surge to open up a gap. MIT runners had no plan to run faster than 72's with next weekend's task on the horizon so they let Salvucci go. Jordan backed off of helping Wedge around the halfway point and Xie backed off after hitting the 3200 in 9:41. Wedge continued on his own, placing second in 15:09.45. Xie earned third in 15:28.93 and Jordan eased up to take fifth in 15:47.06.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's women had a balanced attack, but did have much more depth in the field events than the running events, scoring 71.5 in the jumps and 48 in the throwing events for a 119.5 total and over half of their overall points. The women's premier event, the Pole Vault, was no disappointment. Lauren Kuntz '13 took first place at 12-1 1/2. Cimmy Virdi '16 placed second and set the MIT rookie record at 11-7 3/4. Sherry Wan vaulted a PR of 10-8 and Joanna Chen cleared 10-0 to tie for fourth.
    
    
                  
    
    The other field event in which MIT placed all four participants was the Triple Jump. Michelle Johnson '15, not only won and set a PR of 37-9 1/4, but she also set the MIT record. Stephanie Birkhimer '14 supported with a sixth place at 34-1 1/2 and was followed by Katharina Ross '16 in seventh, also at 34-1 1/2 and Veronica Szklarzewski '15 at 34-0 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    The other field event victory was earned by Isabella Stuopis '16 in the Shot Put with a winning throw of 40-5. Christine Labaza '14 placed seventh with a put of 36-0. 
    
    
                  
    
    Tech took second in four other field events. Johnson took second in the Long Jump with a personal best of 17-1 1/2. Jackie Brew placed third at 17-0 1/2 and Szklarzewski claimed fourth with a jump of 16-4 1/4. Tilly Taylor '15 injured her groin, but still placed second in the Javelin at 119-2. Stephanie Riocci '16 had a PR of 109-0 to place sixth. Labaza threw a PR of 127-3 in the Discus to place second. Stuopis also threw a PR, a mark of 113-7 to place fifth. Ashley Wheeler '15, in addition to gaining a sixth place in the Discus, also placed second with a huge personal best in the Hammer of 152-3. Ellen Liverpool '15 did not have her best day but still earned seventh at 130-11. While not placing very high, the quality of the jumps in the High Jump was impressive. Jackie Konopka '14 tied her PR of 5-2 1/4 to place fifth. Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 earned sixth at 5-1 and Szklarzewski placed eighth with a season best of 4-11.
    
    
                  
    
    Lacking sprinters, the Engineers scored very few points in events below 800 meters. Brew earned most of them by placing second in the 400IH with a personal best of 64.73 and earning seventh in both the 100HH (14.99 in the trials) and the 200 (26.74). In addition, Brew ran but did not place in the 100 and led off the third place 4x100 relay team that ran a season best 49.52. Also scoring in the High Hurdles was Konopka, who ran a PR of 15.22 to place fourth. Konopka was the anchor on the 4x100 team and Szklarzewski and Johnson were the middle legs.
    
    
                  
    
    In the middle distance events, the best event was the 1500. Sarah Quinn '16 won the event by running a 71 third quarter and finishing the final 300 in 54 seconds for a 4:37.33. Louise van den Heuvel '14 took second after taking over the lead when it was obvious the pace was much too slow, to bring the first quarter in at a respectable 77. Her time was 4:38.78. Brooke Johnson '13 placed third in 4:38.82 even though she was suffering from a bad chest cold. Alexandra Taylor '14 fell off the pace in the third quarter, but sprinted back to place fifth in 4:41.54.
    
    
                  
    
    Martina de Geus '14 won the 3000 Steeplechase by 27 seconds as she casually managed the barriers and water jumps in 11:07.97. de Geus also came back to finish seventh in the 400IH. Also running a fairly comfortable race was Kaitlin Allen '14, who took first place honors in the 5K with a sit and kick effort of 18:08.26. With the meet already won, MIT rested Elaine McVay '15 and Quinn.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 800, after pulling Brooke Johnson, and with Taylor not competing to her ability, Cindy Huang '15 and van den Heuvel had to get the job done. Huang, following through a first lap of 67 went to go for the lead with 250 to go, but tried to pass on the inside, got shut down, and was unable to get back up to speed. Huang settled for third in 2:16.80. van den Heuvel ran from the back, taking a cautious approach and nearly even-split a seventh place 2:19.82.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 10K, again trying to save energy for next weekend, the ladies let Jordan Silva of Wheaton go, but maintained the planned 96-97 quarter pace, hitting 1600 splits of 6:22, 6:30, 6:29, 6:29, 6:26 and 6:28. Shivani Kaushal '15 kicked a bit to place second in 40:14.71. Dacie Manion '15 placed third in 40:14.80 and Kali Benavides '15 finished fourth in 40:15.24. Also placing was Allison Hallock in 43:21.80 for sixth place.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event was the 4x400 relay. Isabel Crystal '16, who earlier had placed seventh in the 400, led off with a 61.2 leg. Huang ran a fine 60.4 to put MIT in a very competitive position. van den Heuvel had a tough time, running 64.0 to lose a lot of ground. Taylor finished in 59.9 to bring MIT to fifth place in 4:07.11.
    
    
                  
    
    Next Friday and Saturday, MIT travels to Colby College in Waterville, ME for the New England Division III Championship. The men will try to defend their outdoor title and add to the indoor title earned this February. The women last won in 2011, placing second last year, and hope to get back to the top spot on the victory stand.

    TECH TRACK TEAMS FINISH REGULAR SEASON UNDEFEATED WITH WINS OVER BATES, COLBY, USM
    
    
                  
    
    April 13, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    With an invitational next week and the championships starting the week after, this Saturday's quad meet marked the final regular season scoring meet. Bates, Colby, Southern Maine, and Husson College on the women's side, made the trip down from Maine. For the men, Bates College, even just coming off their exams, would be a formidable force to deal with. The women, despite holding a few individuals out, just had too much depth and quality to lose the meet. MIT performed well in both competitions, leading to victories by both the men and women. With the scoring for non-relay events allotting 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 for the top eight places, and 9-7-6-5 for the relays, the men scored 246.5 to 229 for Bates, 115.5 for USM and 85 for Colby. The women scored 237 points to 160.5 for Colby, 158 for Bates, 89.5 for USM and 37 for Husson.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers won eight of the 19 events to squeak out the win. For the second week in a row, Tyler Singer-Clark '14 took the 100 and 200 as well as anchored both the 4x100 relay and the 4x400 relay to victories. Unlike last week, there was no wind on the track and temperatures in the 50's. Singer-Clark led start to finish in the 100, winning in 11.06. In the 4x100, MIT and USM anchor legs got the batons together, but Singer Clark changed that pretty quickly, pulling away to win by .13, 42.60 to 42.73.  In the 200 the only competition came from teammate States Lee '16. Singer-Clark won in a season best 21.93 while Lee completed the half-oval in 22.25.  Back from a pre-season injury, Nick Diamantoni '15, placed fifth in 22.78. Derek Barnes '16, not quite recovered from his 400 earlier, placed seventh in 22.87. In the 4x400, MIT decided to take advantage of the lack of wind and loaded up the relay despite it being the fourth event for three of the legs. Michael Kaba '16 led off with a 49.3 leg, giving MIT a pretty large lead. Lee took the baton and despite a relatively poor handoff, ran 49.6 to blow the race open. Pat Marx '13 ran an excellent 49.4 all alone to give Singer-Clark an immense lead. Singer-Clark looked in championship form as he polished off the relay with a 48.6 anchor, giving Tech a 3:17.03, good for number five on the NCAA performance list.
    
    
                  
    
    Also having an outstanding day and contributing significant points was Kaba. He won the 400IH in a personal best 54.58 for a new MIT freshman record, one poor hurdle away from running sub 54. Once he gets comfortable with leading his other leg he will drop into the 52's at least. Prior to that effort, Kaba ran a very successful second leg of the 4x100 relay. He also ran a very nice third place PR in the 110HH in 15.15, just one hundredth of a second off the freshman record.
    
    
                  
    
    Derek Barnes '16 and Lee did battle in the 400 for the second week in succession. Once again Barnes edged out Lee, this time the difference came down to the thousandths of a second, both getting credit for a 48.84. Barnes wiped out the freshman record with that winning effort. This was the most dominant event for MIT as they claimed six of the eight scoring places. Marx moved down from his usual race, the 800, showing speed, or the lack of, is not his problem. Marx placed third in 49.32. Diamantoni placed fifth in 50.73 after going out in 22.9 at the 200. Mac Gager '14 ran 51.06 for seventh place as he continued his comeback from a late indoor season injury. DJ Ronde '13 closed out the scoring in the event, finishing eighth in 52.17. The 29 points put MIT ahead for good.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT claimed two field event victories as well. Cyrus Vafadari '13 continued to vault well, clearing 15-7 in a jump-off on his fourth attempt. While expected point scorers Yida Gao '13 and Ben Schreck '15 no-heighted, Marshall Wentworth '16 came through with a sixth place at 13-1 1/2. Jordan Mizerak '14, a decathlete just learning the pole vault, earned seventh with a 12-7 1/2 and Cory Monroe '13, just off an injury, placed eighth, also at 12-7 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    Carington Motley '16 had a pretty big day himself. He won the Triple Jump in a season best 45-1 and took second in the Long Jump at 20-10 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    One other impressive performance was turned in by Harrison Hunter '15 in the 800. With Marx moved to the 400 and Sam Parker '15 unable to compete due to missed practices from an early week injury, Hunter knew Tech needed big points in the 800 and figured he should go out and get them. He was in great position at the 400 in 57 seconds. In the last lap he moved up perfectly, looking like he could win against the talented field. With 100 meters to go, as he fit the wall, he also let it get to him mentally and stopped competing. However, his 1:56.66 for seventh place was a huge PR and shows he has the potential to run much faster.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were missing a few distance runners, who were resting, and not risking injury to a couple others. This did not seem to affect the team's overall performance as others took up the slack. Although the ladies only won seven of the 19 events, they totally dominated the field events, winning five of them and scoring 81 out of a possible 148 in the four jumping events despite two significant no-heights in the Pole Vault. 
    
    
                  
    
    Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 got back to her winning ways in the High Jump, taking the event with a jump of 5-0 1/2. She was supported by a fourth place by Veronica Szklarzewski '15. 
    
    
                  
    
    Even with the no-heights, the ladies claimed four places in the Pole Vault. Lauren Kuntz '13, just off a red-eye flight from a graduate school interview, won in 11-11 3/4. Sherry Wan '16 took third place in 10-6, Marissa Engle '15 placed fifth at 10-0 and Abby Klein '14 earned sixth at 9-6 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    The Long Jump produced the most MIT place winners with five, but the Triple Jump produced the most points with 25. Szklarzewski took the victory in the Long Jump with a jump of 16-10 3/4. Jackie Brew '14 placed fourth at 16-7, Michelle Johnson '15 earned sixth at 16-2 1/2, Katharina Ross took seventh with a season best 15-11 3/4 and Jackie Konopka '14, completing the seven events in the Heptathlon over two successive meets in order to qualify for the New England Division III Championship, placed eighth at 15-11. Johnson came back from the Long Jump to win the Triple with 35-6 3/4. Szklarzewski continued her point scoring spree by getting second in a best of 35-4 1/2. Ross continued to improve, placing fourth at 34-0 1/4, and Stephanie Birkhimer '14 placed fifth with a jump of 33-9 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor '15 won her specialty, the Javelin Throw, with a 131-7 effort for the final win in the field events for the Engineers.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, MIT only won the 800 and 1500 meter runs. Cindy Huang '15 ran an excellent race to win the 800. Sitting back in third place at the 400 in 68 seconds, Huang moved hard as soon as the pace slowed, running away with the event in 2:16.77. Louise van den Heuvel '14, coming back after racing the 1500, won the second section of the 800 with a 2:19.38, good for third place overall. Brooke Johnson '13, the winner of the 1500, took fourth place honors in 2:19.58.
    
    
                  
    
    Johnson won the 1500 in 4:37.27, taking the lead after the 400 mark and running away with the race. van den Heuvel got bumped pretty hard when she made a move to go with Johnson, let it get to her a bit, but still ran a quality 4:44.54 for third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, some MIT runners will head to Princeton for the Larry Ellis meet. Others will compete in the MIT Spring Invite that will host 15 other teams, including four Division I teams (Boston University, Brown, Harvard and Northeastern) as well as a strong group of Division II and III teams.

    SPRING TRAINING TRIP A SUCCESS ALTHOUGH MEET LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED
    
    
                  
    
    March 30, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Track & Field team took 16 men and 16 women to California during the school's Spring Break for an opportunity to train the technical folks (throwers, jumpers, vaulters, sprinters and hurdlers) in warm weather, bond a bit as a team and complete the week with a competition at Westmont College. Everything went well with the exception of the meet itself. Competing without two thirds of the runners on the team, the men placed second among six teams with 77.5 points and the women finished third among seven teams with 60.5 points
    
    
                  
    
    The weather, unlike the rain and relative cold of the past two years, was perfect, with temperatures in the 70's each day and sunny skies. The team had great training, quite a few bonding opportunities with a beach trip (surfing and volleyball), the annual skits, a game of assassins and excellent dinners hosted by alumni and parents.
    
    
                  
    
    The meet started off very well for MIT as Logan Trimble '13 won the 3000 Steeplechase in 9:49.85. He went out a little too fast with a 70 first 400 and then slowed too much in the final laps, although he was very aggressive on the barriers. Trimble showed much improved hurdle technique over last year. He finished with a 37 final 200, which included the water jump and another barrier, so he certainly had plenty left.
    
    
                  
    
    In the next event, the 4x100 relay, the women's quartet of Jackie Brew '14, Veronica Szklarzewski '15, Michelle Johnson '15 and Jackie Konopka '15 did pretty well for only having two weeks of handoff practices, but there is certainly room for improvement. Their 50.72 was competitive for this time of year, placing third. The men led off with Michael DuPlessis '14 who ran an excellent turn, but caught Josh Duncavage '13 earlier than expected. Duncavage ran a solid leg given his tenuous hamstring, but not full speed. Nevertheless MIT was tied for the lead as Duncavage had to wait on Adrian Samsel '16 to make it into the handoff zone. Samsel also ran a solid leg, keeping even with the Westmont team. Tyler Singer-Clark '14 received the baton slightly behind his opponent, looked as though he might pull off the victory, but was unable to gain an advantage. The 42.67 was an excellent time given the difficulties and projects for a sub 42 come championship season.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500, Sarah Quinn '16 and Allison Hallock '16 were expected to score pretty big for Tech. Quinn took the lead at the gun despite directions to the contrary, hit the 200 pretty slow (41) and sped up too much to come through the 400 in 74. She continued to push the pace for the second quarter, hitting the half in 2:25. She slowed in the third quarter, hitting another 74, which was the expected pace, but then faded a bit due to the fast middle, ending in 4:36.82, which smashed the MIT rookie record. Hallock did not come to race and it showed as she fell off the pace immediately, going from 77 to 84 and then 86 before waking up and competing the final 100 meters to preserve sixth place and score a point for her team at 5:02.32. Justin Bullock '14 took the lead right off the bat. Unfortunately for him and the team, he cannot pace well and hit the 400 in 60. He slowed in the next 200 and two opponents snatched the lead, leaving Bullock in their dust as they hit 2:02 and then 3:05. Bullock was fine at 2:04, but then the wheels fell off as he ran 3:14, and finished out of the scoring in 4:09.22.
    
    
                  
    
    The 400 was next on the track. Katharina Ross '16, splitting time with the jumps, was unable to be competitive with the other runners, clocking 65.46, but placing fourth. Singer-Clark was seeded second and delivered on that seeding even though the time was not very fast at 49.77. His first 200 was too slow, so even though he caught all but one runner in the final 200, he did run out of space to complete the job.
    
    
                  
    
    It was at this point that things started going south for the Engineers, at least on the track. In the High Hurdles, Jackie Brew did not have a great race, running 15.50, but placed sixth. Jackie Konopka was having a lot of problems with her ankle, so the hurdles just were not happening. After a 20.66 the coaches pulled her from her remaining events. On the men's side, Brian Djaja '13 injured his hamstring during warmups, probably ending his final season. Adrian Samsel, running in one of his seven events as he prepares for the decathlon, ran a solid 16.19 for third place and Jordan Mizerak '15, also a multi-eventer, ran 17.89.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 100, both Duncavage and DuPlessis were tentative about their chronic hamstring issues and decided not to race in the 100 and 200, ending any chance the men had of defending their win in 2012. Szklarzewski and Stephanie Birkhimer '14, ran 12.94 and 13.20 respectively, Szklarzewski placing fourth.
    
    
                  
    
    Jackie Brew's debut in the 400IH was pretty solid. She got out well, cruising through the first five hurdles in good shape. On the sixth hurdle she went to her weak leg and did not focus on pulling her trail leg through, which caused her to land off balance. That deceleration was not good when she needed to be the most aggressive, but she held on well to finish in 65.69. While the 400IH is Adrian Samsel's best event, he was a bit too mentally and physically beat for a great race. He got out slower than usual, coming up on his weaker leg and having to chop to do it. This continued for three hurdles before he got his race going. By this point the race was over. Richard Lu '16, racing for the first time since his indoor injury back in January, ran better than expected, falling off a bit at the end to finish just behind Samsel. Their times were 59.19 and 59.27 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    Hallock doubled back in the 800, and was more competitive, but still not where she should be. Her 2:31.81 was good for another sixth place. Bullock and Trimble also doubled back and raced superbly. The 400 was relatively slow at 58 for the leaders. Both Bullock and Trimble started towards the back of the lead pack and moved up nicely to hit the 400 mark in 58 and 59 respectively. Bullock took the lead a little prematurely but was pulling away on the backstretch while Trimble continued to move towards the front of the chase pack. In the final 100 Bullock lost the lead and was unable to fight back all the way, but earned second in 1:56.15. Trimble closed well to tie for third in 1:57.05--pretty respectable for distance runners in the first outdoor meet.
    
    
                  
    
    Szklarzewski and Ross raced the 200 for MIT, running 27.48 and 28.89 respectively for the women. With DuPlessis and Duncavage out, only Singer-Clark represented Tech in the 200. Not in late-season form, he was only able to gain third place in 22.56.
    
    
                  
    
    Quinn was pulled from the 5000, even though she was by far the top seed, due to not wanting to risk any damage to her calves, which are still healing from the indoor season. Likewise, MIT pulled the men's 4x400 relay team as the total number of events was catching up to the athletes and not worth the risk of injury.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, actually in the entire meet for MIT, the top performances were delivered by the Pole Vaulters. Lauren Kuntz '13 started where she left off Indoors as National Runner-up, matching that height of 12-11 1/2 to win this meet and certainly qualify for outdoor nationals. Cimmy Virdi '16 cleared 11-5 3/4 and was very close to getting 12-0. Joanna Chen '15 cleared 10-6 and Sherry Wan '16 cleared 10-0. Cyrus Vafadari '13 won the event for the men, clearing 15-5 and nearly getting 15-11 on a borrowed pole. Yida Gao '13 took second with a personal best 14-11. Mizerak placed fifth at 11-11 3/4. Samsel's pole vault debut earned him a clearance at 9-0 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    There were not too many more high place honors for Tech in the field events. Michelle Johnson took fourth place at 36-5 3/4 for the women in the Triple Jump, and was supported by Birkhimer (34-11 3/4), Szklarzewski (34-3) and Ross (32-9 1/2). Carrington Motley '16 led the way for the men with a jump of 42-11 3/4. Angel Echevarria '16 managed 42-10 1/4 while Arinze Okeke '16 jumped 42-2 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Isabella Stuopis '16 took second in the Shot Put with a put of 40-11 1/2, quite a bit off her indoor best, but still an MIT freshman record. Konopka threw 33-2 and Tilly Taylor '15 30-0 1/4. For the men, Alex Noakes '16 earned a point for MIT with his sixth place finish at 41-4 1/4. Curtis Shoyer '16 threw 35-6 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Long Jump, Brew jumped 17-2 3/4 for fifth place and a nice start to the season. After that the Engineers were 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and 17th. In order, Johnson 16-2 1/2, Szklarzewski 15-10, Birkhimer 15-7 3/4, Wan 15-7 1/4, Konopka 15-6 1/2 and Ross 15-2 1/4. Motley again led the men, jumping 21-6 for second place honors. Okeke jumped 20-6 1/4, Samsel at 19-11, Echevarria at 19-4 and Mizerak at 18-10.
    
    
                  
    
    Both Mizerak and Samsel  jumped 5-10 3/4 to place third and fourth in the High Jump. The women's High Jump did not go so well as Preethi Vaidyanathan only managed 4-11 and Konopka was unable to jump.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor placed third in the Javelin, but only threw 120-7, far off her best. Stuopis and Riocci both made finals but neither placed, throwing 107-3 and 106-3. Curtis Shoyer placed fifth with 159-7. Mizerak and Samsel continued their decathlon training, throwing 108-7 and 88-5.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Hammer Throw Stuopis placed fifth with a throw of 107-1 and Riocci placed sixth at 105-6. On the men's side, Shoyer threw 122-8 to place sixth. Noakes just missed placing with his 115-3 effort.
    
    
                  
    
    Stuopis also placed in the Discus even through she only threw 106-3. Noakes also placed sixth on the men's side with his 119-5 throw.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week the Engineers are back home hosting RPI and WPI in the Engineer's Cup. They will certainly need to step up their level of competition if they are going to be successful against the better teams in New England during the early weeks of the Outdoor sesaon.
