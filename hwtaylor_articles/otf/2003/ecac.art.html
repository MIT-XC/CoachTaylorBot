  <p><strong><font size="4">Place 2nd at ECACs With Skeleton Squad</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 15-16, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">At this week's ECAC Division III Championship hosted by MIT, 
    essentially a last chance qualifier for next week's NCAA Division III Championship, 
    Tech athletes dominated in events they were entered, scoring 66.5 points to 
    place 2nd in the meet even though they were not trying to score points.</p>
  <p align="left">While many schools bring all qualifiers to this meet, MIT, with 
    rare exception, only compete those who have an opportunity to either qualify 
    for the NCAA Championship or improve an already existing qualifying mark. 
    In part, this philosophy comes from not wanting to water down a championship 
    just because the standards are easy, and the fact that the MIT athletes are 
    getting ready for final exams.</p>
  <p align="left">With this in mind, the Engineers went to work to try and make 
    good on their last chance of the 2003 outdoor season. The first event for 
    MIT was the Discus. Chris Khan, had a pretty good day, finishing 2nd with 
    a throw of 160-05 although he did not improve his mark. Khan has already qualified 
    provisionally for nationals with a mark of 163-2. Greg Walker improved for 
    the third week in succession, finishing 4th with a throw of 152-11, not quite 
    good enough for the NCAAs.</p>
  <p align="left">The only other event for MIT on the 1st was the 10K. Sean Nolan, 
    still dealing with an injury from the indoor season, that affects how he runs 
    and the muscles he uses, gave it one more effort. Using different muscles 
    and technique have prevented Nolan from running fast since his 31:06 early 
    in the season. Nolan managed to place 3rd in 31:27.63, not good enough to 
    improve his provisionally qualifying time, most likely ending his season.</p>
  <p align="left">On Friday, MIT opened things up with the Hammer, Tech's premier 
    event. This time, Khan won easily, throwing 188-6, not improvement on his 
    195-11 that is currently ranked 2nd in the nation for division III. Marios 
    Michalakis, previously qualified provisionally with a throw of 170-10, threw 
    168-8 to place 6th. David Saylor added his name to the national list with 
    a throw of 166-9, a personal best leading to an 8th place finish. Walker placed 
    9th with throw of 159-4.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina, provisionally qualified in the 200 meter dash with 
    a 21.73, was competing to try and improve his mark in both the 100 and 200. 
    Traina was also hoping to get rid of a quirk of tightening up and leaning 
    back that he developed in the last two weeks. He was not able to fix it enough 
    as he was only able to run 11.23 and 22.34.</p>
  <p align="left">Ben Schmeckpeper was out to prove to his coach and himself that 
    he could hurdle well enough to warrant continuing to run the steeplechase 
    in years to come. Typically losing an estimated 20-30 seconds per race due 
    to poor hurdling form and poor preparation, Schmeckpeper knew he needed to 
    run flawless to run under 9:15 and realistically have an opportunity to run 
    at nationals. Running poorly in the early stages, Schmeckpeper finally got 
    the hang of it, taking the lead halfway through the race. Finishing hard, 
    Schmeckpeper was able to run a PR of 9:22.87 and qualify provisionally for 
    the NCAAs, but it won't be good enough to get selected.</p>
  <p align="left">The Shot Put was next on the schedule. Uzoma Orji, ranked 15th 
    in the country with a 53-1 1/2 throw, wanted to improve his chances and maybe 
    even get the varsity record. Khan, just starting to appreciate the shot put 
    and improving significantly each week, wanted to try and see what he could 
    do. Orji, threw a 5&quot; personal best to improve to 53-6 1/2 and place 2nd. 
    Khan did throw another personal best, this time 48-8 to place 7th, but not 
    yet enough to qualify for nationals.</p>
  <p align="left">Chris Peterson, hoping to get the 400IH freshman record and 
    maybe qualify for nationals, did not move after the 1st hurdle. This hesitation 
    cost him as he never was able to catch the leaders, finishing in 56.76, far 
    off his best of 54.83.</p>
  <p align="left">Tech's final event of the day was the High Jump. Both Brian 
    Hoying and Craig Mielcarz were already provisionally qualified with marks 
    of 6-9 3/4 and 6-8 respectively. While Hoying's performance would likely get 
    him to nationals, Mielcarz's would not. Both looked good in warmups and this 
    continued into the competition. Hoying cleared 6-9 and had a good attempt 
    at 6-10 1/4, finishing 3rd. Mielcarz made good on this last opportunity, clearing 
    6-10 1/4 and placing 2nd.</p>
  <p align="left">Nate Ball, the other MIT national qualifier, was not able to 
    compete for the 2nd week in a row due to a bout with mononucleosis. </p>
  <p align="left">Those who make the qualification, which has become much more 
    difficult over the years with the addition of so many ex NAIA schools and 
    NCAA Division II schools moving down to Division III, as well as the athletes 
    simply getting better, will leave for St. Lawrence University on Tuesday for 
    the Thursday - Saturday competition.</p>
