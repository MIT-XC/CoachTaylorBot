  <p><strong><font size="4">THROWERS LEAD THE WAY TO ANOTHER UNDEFEATED SEASON 
    </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 12, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">In what was supposed to be a tri-meet with Bowdoin and UMass/Lowell 
    turned into a dual meet with host Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. Apparently 
    a change of coaches at UMass/Lowell and no contract caused the change in schedule. 
    MIT, decimated by injuries, managed to hold onto a 1 point victory, 99 to 
    98, over the Polar Bears thanks to the throwers and distance runners.</p>
  <p align="left">Sitting out 5 key competitors due to injuries and other commitments, 
    the Engineers expected to score 36 more points, which would have been a 72 
    point difference, amounting to an easy victory. The meet was set-up to score 
    4 places per event with scoring being 5-3-2-1 for individual events and 5-0 
    for the relays.</p>
  <p align="left">The meet began very well with the Hammer throwers sweeping the 
    event. Chris Khan led the way with a PR of 190-4. Also setting personal bests 
    in the event were David Saylor in 2nd (163-10) and Uzoma Orji (150-7), although 
    he finished 5th for the Engineers and did not score.</p>
  <p align="left">The long jump did not go so well. Craig Mielcarz took a couple 
    of jumps to win the event in 20-6, but that was the end of the good news. 
    With Tom Hoover out with an injury and Brian Hoying only high jumping for 
    the same reason, Bowdoin took the next three places.</p>
  <p align="left">With Dale Cotton taking an EMT exam, the javelin throw was nearly 
    void of MIT entrants with the exception of Craig Mielcarz, who managed a point 
    with a 4th place effort. MIT had a narrow lead, 17-16.</p>
  <p align="left">The high jump went in MIT's favor but they did not get the win. 
    Mielcarz., coming off a lower back injury and not able to jump for over a 
    week and a half, cleared 6-6 for 2nd place. Mielcarz was supported by Brian 
    Hoying in 3rd and Rick Rajter in 4th, both clearing 6-2.</p>
  <p align="left">The shot put was next and while Uzoma Orji easily took first 
    with a throw of 48-6, Chris Khan was not able to glide due to a sore hamstring 
    and was therefore not able to score.</p>
  <p align="left">The triple jump victory went to Bowdoin, but Rajter and Victor 
    Williamson were able to get 2nd and 3rd places to bring the score to a tie 
    of 33 all after 6 field events. </p>
  <p align="left">The 3000 steeplechase was the first running event. Ben Schmeckpeper 
    led the way from start to finish with a 9:44.10. Craig Wildman and Carlos 
    Renjifo, despite a very painful toe he hurt in a steeple drill earlier in 
    the week, supported Schmeckpeper with gutsy 2nd and 3rd places.</p>
  <p align="left">The 400 relay went well for three of the four legs, but running 
    without star sprinter, Zach Traina showed the Engineer's weakness as Bowdoin 
    walked MIT down to win the relay. MIT was now up 4 points and it looked like 
    the meet was about to turn in Bowdoin's favor.</p>
  <p align="left">News from the pole vault, which was conducted inside, had Bowdoin 
    placing 1-2 and taking the lead in the meet by 1 point. Nate Ball, MIT's 15-8 
    vaulter continued to be sidelined with a hamstring injury he suffered in January.</p>
  <p align="left">Without All America runner Brian Anderson, MIT's hope in the 
    1500 was with Sean Nolan. Nolan ran 4:03 in the windy conditions but was not 
    able to hold off the Bowdoin runners who went 1-2 and 4.</p>
  <p align="left">Just as things were looking bad for Tech, Rajter, Mielcarz and 
    Chris Peterson went 1-2-3 in the 110HH to outscore Bowdoin 10-1 and retake 
    the overall lead by 1 point, 58 to 57. Rajter ran 15.75 for his best effort 
    of the season.</p>
  <p align="left">Fortunately for MIT, Bowdoin only had 1 entry in the 400. While 
    MIT only had one of their 400 runners ready to run, two more MIT athletes 
    were entered to score the points and came through to give MIT 2-3-4. Thad 
    Wozniak led Taku Iida, normally a 800 runner, and Nestor Hernandez, a pole 
    vaulter who had just placed 3rd in that event, to the finish line.</p>
  <p align="left">The 100 was an event MIT was counting on, even without Traina 
    in the lineup. Things have not been working well for MIT despite their undefeated 
    season and this was not different. With David Blau feeling the effects of 
    a cold, Marc Washington was the only one to place, earning a season best 11.46 
    for 2nd. Bowdoin was now up 5 points.</p>
  <p align="left">The 800 was next, and again, with Anderson missing MIT was not 
    expecting much. Fortunately, George Hanson did not share the coaches' thoughts. 
    While Hanson should not have led the first 400, he did show the fortitude 
    to hold onto 3rd place and a season best 2:02.86. Imran Hendley added a 4th 
    place to give MIT 1 more point than the coaches planned on. Bowdoin was up 
    8 and things were not looking good for MIT.</p>
  <p align="left">The plan was for Peterson and Williamson to place 1-2 in the 
    400IH, but Bowdoin had other plans and their's appeared better made. Foil 
    of Bowdoin ran 55 to win over Peterson's season best of 56.40. Rajter and 
    Williamson placed 3rd and 4th respectively.</p>
  <p align="left">Again, as things were looking worst, the throwers came through 
    and bailed the rest of the team out. Chris Khan, using only arms, threw 153-6 
    to win the discus. Orji and Greg Walker threw 130-9 and 129-10 to place 2nd 
    and 3rd respectively. The real surprise was that David Saylor threw a huge 
    personal best of 129-9 to move into 4th place and bring MIT back into the 
    lead by 4 points, 87 to 83.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT did not have enough healthy bodies to put together a reasonable 
    4x400 relay, so they needed to score 12 points in the 200 and 5000 in order 
    to lock up the meet before the relay. The 200 runners placed 2-3 with Washington 
    leading the way in a season best 22.92. This effort forced Schmeckpeper to 
    go ahead and run the 5000, which he was entered in but hoping not to run.</p>
  <p align="left">Needing 7 points, at least a 1st and 3rd, Nolan took the lead 
    from the start and led wire to wire to win easily in 15:20.75. Schmeckpeper 
    could not hold onto 2nd and fell to 4th with a mile to go. Schmeckpeper moved 
    back into 3rd and pushed to regain 2nd but the steeplechase had taken too 
    much out of the cross country All American runner. With 100 meters to go, 
    the 2nd Bowdoin runner pulled alongside Schmeckpeper and appeared ready to 
    lead Bowdoin to victory. Schmeckpeper responded with an unbelievable kick, 
    luckily not getting disqualified as he drifted a little to the outside as 
    he responded, and pushing to the finish line in 3rd place in 15:30.24. Bowdoin 
    College was very gracious regarding the potential disqualification, displaying 
    a continued good sportsmanship throughout the competition.</p>
