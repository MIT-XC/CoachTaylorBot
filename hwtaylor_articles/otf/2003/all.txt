    April 12, 2003
    
    
      
    
    In what was supposed to be a tri-meet with Bowdoin and UMass/Lowell 
        turned into a dual meet with host Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. Apparently 
        a change of coaches at UMass/Lowell and no contract caused the change in schedule. 
        MIT, decimated by injuries, managed to hold onto a 1 point victory, 99 to 
        98, over the Polar Bears thanks to the throwers and distance runners.
    
    
      
    
    Sitting out 5 key competitors due to injuries and other commitments, 
        the Engineers expected to score 36 more points, which would have been a 72 
        point difference, amounting to an easy victory. The meet was set-up to score 
        4 places per event with scoring being 5-3-2-1 for individual events and 5-0 
        for the relays.
    
    
      
    
    The meet began very well with the Hammer throwers sweeping the 
        event. Chris Khan led the way with a PR of 190-4. Also setting personal bests 
        in the event were David Saylor in 2nd (163-10) and Uzoma Orji (150-7), although 
        he finished 5th for the Engineers and did not score.
    
    
      
    
    The long jump did not go so well. Craig Mielcarz took a couple 
        of jumps to win the event in 20-6, but that was the end of the good news. 
        With Tom Hoover out with an injury and Brian Hoying only high jumping for 
        the same reason, Bowdoin took the next three places.
    
    
      
    
    With Dale Cotton taking an EMT exam, the javelin throw was nearly 
        void of MIT entrants with the exception of Craig Mielcarz, who managed a point 
        with a 4th place effort. MIT had a narrow lead, 17-16.
    
    
      
    
    The high jump went in MIT's favor but they did not get the win. 
        Mielcarz., coming off a lower back injury and not able to jump for over a 
        week and a half, cleared 6-6 for 2nd place. Mielcarz was supported by Brian 
        Hoying in 3rd and Rick Rajter in 4th, both clearing 6-2.
    
    
      
    
    The shot put was next and while Uzoma Orji easily took first 
        with a throw of 48-6, Chris Khan was not able to glide due to a sore hamstring 
        and was therefore not able to score.
    
    
      
    
    The triple jump victory went to Bowdoin, but Rajter and Victor 
        Williamson were able to get 2nd and 3rd places to bring the score to a tie 
        of 33 all after 6 field events. 
    
    
      
    
    The 3000 steeplechase was the first running event. Ben Schmeckpeper 
        led the way from start to finish with a 9:44.10. Craig Wildman and Carlos 
        Renjifo, despite a very painful toe he hurt in a steeple drill earlier in 
        the week, supported Schmeckpeper with gutsy 2nd and 3rd places.
    
    
      
    
    The 400 relay went well for three of the four legs, but running 
        without star sprinter, Zach Traina showed the Engineer's weakness as Bowdoin 
        walked MIT down to win the relay. MIT was now up 4 points and it looked like 
        the meet was about to turn in Bowdoin's favor.
    
    
      
    
    News from the pole vault, which was conducted inside, had Bowdoin 
        placing 1-2 and taking the lead in the meet by 1 point. Nate Ball, MIT's 15-8 
        vaulter continued to be sidelined with a hamstring injury he suffered in January.
    
    
      
    
    Without All America runner Brian Anderson, MIT's hope in the 
        1500 was with Sean Nolan. Nolan ran 4:03 in the windy conditions but was not 
        able to hold off the Bowdoin runners who went 1-2 and 4.
    
    
      
    
    Just as things were looking bad for Tech, Rajter, Mielcarz and 
        Chris Peterson went 1-2-3 in the 110HH to outscore Bowdoin 10-1 and retake 
        the overall lead by 1 point, 58 to 57. Rajter ran 15.75 for his best effort 
        of the season.
    
    
      
    
    Fortunately for MIT, Bowdoin only had 1 entry in the 400. While 
        MIT only had one of their 400 runners ready to run, two more MIT athletes 
        were entered to score the points and came through to give MIT 2-3-4. Thad 
        Wozniak led Taku Iida, normally a 800 runner, and Nestor Hernandez, a pole 
        vaulter who had just placed 3rd in that event, to the finish line.
    
    
      
    
    The 100 was an event MIT was counting on, even without Traina 
        in the lineup. Things have not been working well for MIT despite their undefeated 
        season and this was not different. With David Blau feeling the effects of 
        a cold, Marc Washington was the only one to place, earning a season best 11.46 
        for 2nd. Bowdoin was now up 5 points.
    
    
      
    
    The 800 was next, and again, with Anderson missing MIT was not 
        expecting much. Fortunately, George Hanson did not share the coaches' thoughts. 
        While Hanson should not have led the first 400, he did show the fortitude 
        to hold onto 3rd place and a season best 2:02.86. Imran Hendley added a 4th 
        place to give MIT 1 more point than the coaches planned on. Bowdoin was up 
        8 and things were not looking good for MIT.
    
    
      
    
    The plan was for Peterson and Williamson to place 1-2 in the 
        400IH, but Bowdoin had other plans and their's appeared better made. Foil 
        of Bowdoin ran 55 to win over Peterson's season best of 56.40. Rajter and 
        Williamson placed 3rd and 4th respectively.
    
    
      
    
    Again, as things were looking worst, the throwers came through 
        and bailed the rest of the team out. Chris Khan, using only arms, threw 153-6 
        to win the discus. Orji and Greg Walker threw 130-9 and 129-10 to place 2nd 
        and 3rd respectively. The real surprise was that David Saylor threw a huge 
        personal best of 129-9 to move into 4th place and bring MIT back into the 
        lead by 4 points, 87 to 83.
    
    
      
    
    MIT did not have enough healthy bodies to put together a reasonable 
        4x400 relay, so they needed to score 12 points in the 200 and 5000 in order 
        to lock up the meet before the relay. The 200 runners placed 2-3 with Washington 
        leading the way in a season best 22.92. This effort forced Schmeckpeper to 
        go ahead and run the 5000, which he was entered in but hoping not to run.
    
    
      
    
    Needing 7 points, at least a 1st and 3rd, Nolan took the lead 
        from the start and led wire to wire to win easily in 15:20.75. Schmeckpeper 
        could not hold onto 2nd and fell to 4th with a mile to go. Schmeckpeper moved 
        back into 3rd and pushed to regain 2nd but the steeplechase had taken too 
        much out of the cross country All American runner. With 100 meters to go, 
        the 2nd Bowdoin runner pulled alongside Schmeckpeper and appeared ready to 
        lead Bowdoin to victory. Schmeckpeper responded with an unbelievable kick, 
        luckily not getting disqualified as he drifted a little to the outside as 
        he responded, and pushing to the finish line in 3rd place in 15:30.24. Bowdoin 
        College was very gracious regarding the potential disqualification, displaying 
        a continued good sportsmanship throughout the competition.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT visits Northeastern for the Husky Invitational 
        at the Dedham, MA track.

    **Men's Track Qualifies 2 More for NCAAs, Bringing Total 
        to 10**
    
    
      
    
    **Place 2nd at ECACs With Skeleton Squad**
    
    
      
    
    May 15-16, 2003
    
    
      
    
    At this week's ECAC Division III Championship hosted by MIT, 
        essentially a last chance qualifier for next week's NCAA Division III Championship, 
        Tech athletes dominated in events they were entered, scoring 66.5 points to 
        place 2nd in the meet even though they were not trying to score points.
    
    
      
    
    While many schools bring all qualifiers to this meet, MIT, with 
        rare exception, only compete those who have an opportunity to either qualify 
        for the NCAA Championship or improve an already existing qualifying mark. 
        In part, this philosophy comes from not wanting to water down a championship 
        just because the standards are easy, and the fact that the MIT athletes are 
        getting ready for final exams.
    
    
      
    
    With this in mind, the Engineers went to work to try and make 
        good on their last chance of the 2003 outdoor season. The first event for 
        MIT was the Discus. Chris Khan, had a pretty good day, finishing 2nd with 
        a throw of 160-05 although he did not improve his mark. Khan has already qualified 
        provisionally for nationals with a mark of 163-2. Greg Walker improved for 
        the third week in succession, finishing 4th with a throw of 152-11, not quite 
        good enough for the NCAAs.
    
    
      
    
    The only other event for MIT on the 1st was the 10K. Sean Nolan, 
        still dealing with an injury from the indoor season, that affects how he runs 
        and the muscles he uses, gave it one more effort. Using different muscles 
        and technique have prevented Nolan from running fast since his 31:06 early 
        in the season. Nolan managed to place 3rd in 31:27.63, not good enough to 
        improve his provisionally qualifying time, most likely ending his season.
    
    
      
    
    On Friday, MIT opened things up with the Hammer, Tech's premier 
        event. This time, Khan won easily, throwing 188-6, not improvement on his 
        195-11 that is currently ranked 2nd in the nation for division III. Marios 
        Michalakis, previously qualified provisionally with a throw of 170-10, threw 
        168-8 to place 6th. David Saylor added his name to the national list with 
        a throw of 166-9, a personal best leading to an 8th place finish. Walker placed 
        9th with throw of 159-4.
    
    
      
    
    Zach Traina, provisionally qualified in the 200 meter dash with 
        a 21.73, was competing to try and improve his mark in both the 100 and 200. 
        Traina was also hoping to get rid of a quirk of tightening up and leaning 
        back that he developed in the last two weeks. He was not able to fix it enough 
        as he was only able to run 11.23 and 22.34.
    
    
      
    
    Ben Schmeckpeper was out to prove to his coach and himself that 
        he could hurdle well enough to warrant continuing to run the steeplechase 
        in years to come. Typically losing an estimated 20-30 seconds per race due 
        to poor hurdling form and poor preparation, Schmeckpeper knew he needed to 
        run flawless to run under 9:15 and realistically have an opportunity to run 
        at nationals. Running poorly in the early stages, Schmeckpeper finally got 
        the hang of it, taking the lead halfway through the race. Finishing hard, 
        Schmeckpeper was able to run a PR of 9:22.87 and qualify provisionally for 
        the NCAAs, but it won't be good enough to get selected.
    
    
      
    
    The Shot Put was next on the schedule. Uzoma Orji, ranked 15th 
        in the country with a 53-1 1/2 throw, wanted to improve his chances and maybe 
        even get the varsity record. Khan, just starting to appreciate the shot put 
        and improving significantly each week, wanted to try and see what he could 
        do. Orji, threw a 5" personal best to improve to 53-6 1/2 and place 2nd. 
        Khan did throw another personal best, this time 48-8 to place 7th, but not 
        yet enough to qualify for nationals.
    
    
      
    
    Chris Peterson, hoping to get the 400IH freshman record and 
        maybe qualify for nationals, did not move after the 1st hurdle. This hesitation 
        cost him as he never was able to catch the leaders, finishing in 56.76, far 
        off his best of 54.83.
    
    
      
    
    Tech's final event of the day was the High Jump. Both Brian 
        Hoying and Craig Mielcarz were already provisionally qualified with marks 
        of 6-9 3/4 and 6-8 respectively. While Hoying's performance would likely get 
        him to nationals, Mielcarz's would not. Both looked good in warmups and this 
        continued into the competition. Hoying cleared 6-9 and had a good attempt 
        at 6-10 1/4, finishing 3rd. Mielcarz made good on this last opportunity, clearing 
        6-10 1/4 and placing 2nd.
    
    
      
    
    Nate Ball, the other MIT national qualifier, was not able to 
        compete for the 2nd week in a row due to a bout with mononucleosis. 
    
    
      
    
    Those who make the qualification, which has become much more 
        difficult over the years with the addition of so many ex NAIA schools and 
        NCAA Division II schools moving down to Division III, as well as the athletes 
        simply getting better, will leave for St. Lawrence University on Tuesday for 
        the Thursday - Saturday competition.

    **MIT SHINES IN ENGINEER'S CUP DESPITE THE POOR WEATHER**
    
    
      
    
    April 6, 2003
    
    
      
    
    The 2003 version of the Engineer's Cup was supposed to be competed 
        on Saturday at MIT. However, the sleet and snow predicted for Saturday caused 
        the postponment of the meet until Sunday. This move was beneficial although 
        the weather conditions still were not ideal. MIT won 12 of the 19 events over 
        the teams from RPI and WPI. Due to the date change and the fact that not everyone 
        was able to make the trip on Sunday given the last minute changes, the meet 
        was not scored. This fact did not seem to deter the athletes from MIT.
    
    
      
    
    Braving the 40 degree temperatures and the winds gusting to 
        25 mph, MIT dominated the field. The 200 and 3000 Steeplechase were particularly 
        good for MIT as they swept the first three places in both events. In most 
        cases, any athlete who was even slightly injured or tight on the MIT team 
        was told not to compete, leaving many of the MIT athletes in the meet help 
        category.
    
    
      
    
    Uzoma Orji improved his national qualifying mark in the shot 
        put with a throw of 53-1. That throw put him within 2 1/2" of the school 
        record and moved him to 5th nationally. Sean Nolan had a season best in the 
        5000 with a 14:56.72 in the brutal wind. Carlos Renjifo ran his inaugural 
        3000 Steeplechase race and broke 10:00 with a 9:59.03 performance. Josh Chartier 
        jumped a year best 13' in the pole vault to get 3rd place.
    
    
      
    
    Overall, the performances were not very good, but neither was 
        the setting. The team expects to improve greatly next Saturday when they take 
        their undefeated record to Maine to compete against Bowdoin College and UMass/Lowell 
        in a tri-meet.

    **ENGINEERS HAVE BEST SPRING OUTING SO FAR**
    
    
      
    
    April 19, 2003
    
    
      
    
    It took four weeks, but the MIT Men's track team finally began 
        to show the sort of performances they produced during the indoor season that 
        carried them to the New England Division III title. Participating in the Northeastern 
        University Husky Invitational, the Engineers had 17 season or personal bests 
        and 5 new or improved national qualifying marks despite a headwind for the 
        dashes and hurdles and the continued cool temperatures that are lingering 
        longer than usual this year.
    
    
      
    
    Chris Khan had what has become a typical great day when he added 
        four feet to his hammer throw with a 194-4 effort, ranking him 2nd in the 
        country for Division III. Khan also threw 159-3 in the discus despite the 
        tailwind. Marios Michalakis also had a national qualifying performance in 
        the hammer with a 170-10 effort.
    
    
      
    
    Brian Hoying and Craig Mielcarz both jumped 6-08 in the high 
        jump to make the provisional qualifying mark for nationals. Both had good 
        attempts at 6-10 but sitting around for 7 hours in 50 degree temperatures 
        got the best of them.
    
    
      
    
    Sean Nolan ran the first 10K of this career and made the most 
        of it by pulling away immediately and running 31:06.49 to provisionally qualify 
        for nationals. Also making his debut in the 10,000 meter event was Steve Maltas, 
        who ran 33:10.69, good for only being healthy a few weeks.
    
    
      
    
    Ben Schmeckpeper was still having problems measuring his approach 
        to the steeple barriers, but ran a season best of 9:37.45 regardless. 
    
    
      
    
    Two huge bests were had by 1500 meter runners, John Brewer and 
        Fivos Constantinous. Brewer ran an all time personal best of 4:05.36 despite 
        just coming off achilles tendinitis. Constantinous ran a season best of 4:07.54 
        even though he made a few tactical errors during the race. Both hope to improve 
        even more in the upcoming conference championship.
    
    
      
    
    Rick Rajter focused on the 110HH for the first time this season, 
        delivering a season best of 15.58 into a pretty good headwind. Rajter also 
        led the way in the 1600 meter relay with a 50.5 leg to help the team run 3:27.27 
        even though they were missing two of their best legs.
    
    
      
    
    Dale Cotton had some problems with his elbow but still produced 
        a 169-8 throw in the javelin. Cotton's throw will allow him to continue his 
        season a couple more weeks.
    
    
      
    
    The meet breathed some life into the MIT track team and seemed 
        to inspire them as they enter the championship season. Next week, MIT travels 
        to Smith College to defend their NEWMAC Conference title on Saturday, April 
        26.

    **3 ALL AMERICA WINNERS PACE MIT TO 16TH PLACE FINISH 
        AT NATIONALS**
    
    
      
    
    May 22-24, 2003
    
    
      
    
    Chris Khan led MIT's scoring at the NCAA Division III Championship, 
        held at St. Lawrence University, with a 3rd place in the Hammer Throw and 
        a 5th in the Discus Throw. Brian Hoying added a tie for 4th in the High Jump 
        to complete MIT's total of 14.5 points, good for 16th place at the National 
        Championship.
    
    
      
    
    The first event in the championship was the men's discus on 
        Thursday morning. Khan was the last seed in the 16 person field with an entering 
        mark of 163-2. Khan never considered anything put trying to win this event. 
        After watching the first flight perform poorly, Khan unleashed his best throw 
        and a new MIT record with a 171-0 on his second throw of the second flight 
        to put him in 5th place going into the finals. The positions in the finals 
        did not change, earning Khan his 2nd All America honor in the discus.
    
    
      
    
    Later that day, Brian Hoying and Craig Mielcarz began their 
        quest to place in the top 8 in the High Jump. Both looked very good in the 
        warmups, easily clearing what would be the opening height of 6-5. When the 
        competition began, both cleared 6-5 on the first attempt. Only 1 athlete went 
        out at the opening height, but at 6-7 four more left the competition. Mielcarz 
        made it on his first attempt but Hoying needed two tries to make the height. 
        At 6-9, Mielcarz, a 4 time All America in this event, was not his usual self, 
        missing on all three attempts. Unfortunately, 8 jumpers cleared the height, 
        putting Mielcarz out of placing by 1 position. Hoying made the height on his 
        2nd attempt, putting him in a tie for 4th if no one behind him cleared 6-11. 
        Hoying made a couple of good attempts at 6-11, but was not able to clear the 
        height. While two cleared 6-11 and one 7-1, neither were behind Hoying before 
        clearing the height, placing him in a tie for 4th and giving MIT 8.5 points 
        for the day.
    
    
      
    
    On Friday afternoon, Khan returned to competition, this time 
        in the Hammer Throw. The hammer is an event that Khan had competed in at two 
        other nationals but had only finished with one 8th place finish. This year, 
        Khan entered the competition as the 2nd seed with a best of 195-11 and was 
        determined to finish well. His first throw hit the closed left side gate solidly 
        and still went 170'. On his second throw he bombed one 192-3 to move into 
        2nd place. In the finals, Khan could not improve, but was passed by the indoor 
        weight throw champion, and had to settle for 3rd place.
    
    
      
    
    MIT will graduate Hoying and Mielcarz but will return Khan as 
        well as indoor All American, Brian Anderson, cross country All American, Ben 
        Schmeckpeper, and national qualifiers, Nate Ball in the Pole Vault, Marios 
        Michalakis and David Saylor in the Hammer Throw, Uzoma Orji in the Shot Put 
        and Zach Traina in the 200. Combine this with the numerous other conference 
        place winners and what seems to be a strong incoming freshman class and MIT 
        may well improve their 16th place finish next year.

    **ENGINEERS FINISH PERFECT YEAR WITH WIN IN NEW ENGLAND 
        DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    May 3, 2003
    
    
      
    
    MIT completed an unlikely year, by matching their indoor undefeated 
        season and New England Division III Championship with the same result for 
        the outdoor season. Going into the meet once all the entries were completed, 
        MIT was favored by about 10 points. When the dust had settled in Lewiston, 
        Maine on the Bates College track, the Engineers had scored 141 points, winning 
        over 2nd place finisher Williams College by 39 points.
    
    
      
    
    Many incredible performances led the way to this championship, 
        and they happened in nearly every event. Seventeen season or personal bests 
        and three new or improved national qualifying performances were indicative 
        of the type of day the Tech men had.
    
    
      
    
    Chris Khan surpassed expectations by not only winning the Hammer 
        in 191-6 and Discus in 161-0, but threw nearly two feet further than ever 
        before and placed 6th in the Shot Put with a 48-5 1/4. Khan's 23 points outscored 
        many of the teams in the championship.
    
    
      
    
    Having a career day on the track was Zach Traina, who won the 
        200 with a national qualifying time of 21.73 for a personal best, placed 2nd 
        in the 100 with a season best of 10.96 and led off the 400 relay team of David 
        Blau, Marc Washington and Rick Rajter, which posted a season best of over 
        a full second to place 3rd overall while running out of the slow section in 
        42.85.
    
    
      
    
    Every time Williams or Springfield would do well or score in 
        an event, MIT would step up and place even higher. The best example of this 
        was in the Discus. Greg Walker threw three successive personal bests as he 
        improved 13' over his seed to move into 2nd and then keep 2nd as others would 
        throw farther to pass him. 
    
    
      
    
    MIT took 5 first places in the meet. In addition to the Hammer 
        and Discus wins by Khan and the 200 victory by Traina, Brian Hoying and Nate 
        Ball won their respective events, the High Jump and Pole Vault. Hoying was 
        clean through 6-8 and then cleared his personal outdoor best of 6-9 3/4 on 
        his 2nd attempt to win the event. Ball, in his 2nd meet since coming back 
        from his injury, won the meet at 14-9, and then proceeded to clear 15-5 and 
        then 15-8. He finally moved up to a 15' pole and attempted 15-10 but was just 
        short on his final attempt.
    
    
      
    
    Other than Walker's 2nd place in the Discus, Sean Nolan earned 
        a 2nd in the 10K with a hard fought 31:11.40. Nolan, trying to improve his 
        national qualifying performance, led the way into a stiff wind for the first 
        4 miles of the event. With 1 mile to go Holtshute from Williams took the lead 
        for good leaving Nolan to settle for 2nd. Also placing 2nd was Uzoma Orji, 
        losing a division III competition in New England for the first time all year. 
        Orji threw a respectable 52-6 3/4 but lost to senior Trey Wright of Williams, 
        who threw 53-2.
    
    
      
    
    Third place performances were earned by the 400 relay, Ben Schmeckpeper 
        in the 3000 Steeplechase and Craig Mielcarz in the High Jump. Schmeckpeper 
        ran a better paced race than earlier in the season, moving from10th to 3rd 
        over the course of the race. Running laps between 75-77 seconds, Schmeckpeper 
        looked as though he might be able to catch 2nd place but fell a little short 
        while running his season best of 9:26.43. Mielcarz, bouncing back and forth 
        from the Long Jump, 110HH and High Jump, finally settled in long enough to 
        clear 6-8. He attempted 6-9 3/4 but was inconsistent in his approach. Mielcarz 
        will be focusing on the High Jump exclusively for the remainder of the season.
    
    
      
    
    Keeping with the trend, MIT had three 4th place finishes as 
        well. Mielcarz came through on his final attempt to move from 8th to 4th in 
        the Long Jump with an effort of 22-1. Marios Michalakis threw 168-3 in the 
        Hammer to support Khan's win and add to the total of 51 points scored by the 
        throwers. Also, placing 4th, before his shot put, was Orji, who threw a personal 
        best of 142-2 in the Discus to claim the top event for MIT with 23 points.
    
    
      
    
    Nestor Hernandez proved that last weekend was no fluke as he 
        jumped 21-10 in the Long Jump to place 6th and add points to what Mielcarz 
        scored in the event. Other 6th place finishes were accomplished by Steve Maltas 
        in the 10K, Rajter in the 110HH, Chris Peterson in the 400IH, and Khan in 
        the Shot Put. Maltas ran his 2nd 10K of the season, improving by 22 seconds 
        to run 32:48.50. Rajter, hurting his heel in the Triple Jump, and competing 
        in the High Jump and 400 relay, only had enough left to hold onto 6th with 
        a 15.30 performance. Peterson performed the best of the 6th place finishers, 
        improving by 1.2 seconds from last week's performance for a 54.83.
    
    
      
    
    Victor Williamson placed 7th in two events, earning a personal 
        best in the 400IH with a 55.62 and a season best in the Triple Jump with a 
        43-3. Mielcarz added another personal best in the 110HH for7th place, running 
        15.39 in the trials. Dale Cotton, threw a season best into a strong head wind 
        in the Javelin with a 172-7. Josh Chartier cleared 12-9 in the Pole Vault 
        to place 7th and beat teammate Hernandez by 1 place on misses.
    
    
      
    
    Not losing a single Division III competition in indoor or outdoor 
        track has not been accomplished since 1990. To do so in a year with so many 
        injuries is truly a tribute to the team and their commitment to excellence.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT travels to New Hampshire for the All New Englands 
        in hopes of improving some individual marks for the national championships.

    **Men's Track Places in Tie for 11th at NEICAAA Championship 
        With Partial Team**
    
    
      
    
    MAY 9-10, 2003
    
    
      
    
    MIT traveled to the University of New Hampshire for the All 
        Division New England Championship (NEIcAAA) and finished in a tie for 11th 
        place despite traveling with a partial squad. Throwers and jumpers scored 
        27 points collectively, led by a 2nd place finish by Chris Khan in the hammer 
        throw with a toss of 190-6.
    
    
      
    
    Due to the fact that many students at MIT have final projects 
        due this week and next, combined with the fact that last weekend was spent 
        away from campus at Bates College, most of the track team who had qualified 
        for this meet, particularly Marios Michalakis (hammer) and Chris Peterson 
        (400IH) elected to catch up academically back at MIT. In addition to the academic 
        side of things, Nate Ball had to miss the trip due to an illness that may 
        be a case of strep throat and Nestor Hernandez had to miss because of an soar 
        heel.
    
    
      
    
    After the New England Division III Championship, all other championship 
        meets are optional for the MIT team and they can choose what events they would 
        like to do. Craig Mielcarz, elected to just do the high jump even though he 
        was also qualified in the long jump. Mielcarz got good height on his last 
        attempt at 6-09, but had to settle for 5th place with 6-07. Brian Hoying did 
        not miss through 6-07 and placed third.
    
    
      
    
    As has been the case all season, the throwers came through despite 
        the absence of Michalakis, who surely would have scored in the hammer and 
        the fact that Chris Khan did not throw the shot put and fouled out of the 
        discus when he was not aggressive enough with his reverse.
    
    
      
    
    Uzoma Orji had some big warmups over 55' but was only able to 
        throw 52-4 3/4 in the competition of the shot put, good enough for 4th place. 
        Greg Walker continued his great season with a 151-11 discus throw for 5th 
        place.
    
    
      
    
    The runners did not fair so well. Zach Traina showed his fatigue 
        from last weekend's competition, not making the finals in either the 100 or 
        200 meter dashes. Sean Nolan ran pretty well but not good enough in the 5000 
        to place or improve his time. Ben Schmeckpeper stuttered on nearly every hurdle, 
        exhausting himself and preventing a good performance as he finished 10th in 
        the steeplechase.
    
    
      
    
    Next Thursday and Friday at the ECAC Championship hosted by 
        MIT, these same competitors, as well as those who missed this meet will try 
        to improve their national marks in hopes of making it to the NCAA Championship 
        the following week.

    **MIT WINS 3RD CONSECUTIVE NEWMAC TITLE**
    
    
      
    
    **35 Personal or Season Bests Lead to Championship**
    
    
      
    
    April 27, 2003
    
    
      
    
    MIT's men's track team won their 3rd consecutive NEWMAC Championship 
        today. Chris Khan led the way with two personal bests and 26 points scored, 
        earning the 2003 male track and field athlete of the year for the NEWMAC conference. 
        MIT finished with 253 points, easily outdistancing Springfield College with 
        185, Coast Guard with 126, WPI with 97, Wheaton with 62 and Babson College 
        with 33 points.
    
    
      
    
    Khan improved his national mark in the hammer with a 195-11 
        winning throw on his last effort. He also won the discus with a 162-11 throw 
        with a tailwind, which is not favorable in the discus. Perhaps his best effort 
        was his 46-7 1/2 throw in the shot put, which was nearly a foot personal best. 
        All together, the throwers scored 69 points in the hammer, discus and shot 
        put with a scoring format of 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 and a maximum of 4 entries per 
        team per event. The best event was the hammer, where Tech earned the first 
        4 places. Following Khan were Marios Michalakis 163-9, David Saylor 159-4 
        and Greg Walker 154-5. In the discus, after Khan, Uzoma Orji threw a personal 
        best of 140-3 for 3rd, just ahead of Walker at 138-2 and Tom Weathers in 6th 
        with 129-7. Orji also won the shot put with a throw of 51-8 1/4. Dale Cotton 
        was not able to compete in the javelin due to the meet being moved to Sunday 
        at the last minute due to weather conditions on Saturday.
    
    
      
    
    The jumpers were pulling their own weight, scoring 65 points 
        in the long jump, triple jump, high jump and pole vault. Nate Ball, jumped 
        for the first time since January, returning from his hamstring injury with 
        a successful, and provisionally national qualifying vault at 15-2 1/4 and 
        three narrow misses at 15-9 to win the event. Ball was supported by Josh Chartier, 
        who vaulted 13-3 for 3rd and Nestor Hernandez at 12-0 for 7th. Rick Rajter 
        scored 10 of his 25 points when he won the triple jump with a season best 
        of 43-5 3/4. Rajter was accompanied in the triple jump by Victor Williamson 
        who broke out of his slump with a 42-9 3/4 effort, good for 3rd place. The 
        biggest improvements of the day were accomplished in the long jump. Craig 
        Mielcarz led way, scoring 8 of his 22 points by leaping to a personal best 
        of 22-6 3/4. Nestor Hernandez stepped up to take the place of injured Tom 
        Hoover, and improved nearly two feet with a Beamon like jump of 21-11 1/4 
        to place 4th. Brian Hoying took two jumps, enough to secure a solid 7th place 
        of 21-0 3/4. The high jump had the potential to be a premier event with 2 
        all america winners, including the defending national champion, and 5 former 
        national qualifiers. However, between the Penn Relays the day before for a 
        couple of the jumpers and the other events already competed in, the jumpers 
        just did not have it. Mielcarz garnered 2nd with a 6-7 jump, done immediately 
        after the 110HH and the long jump. Hoying placed 3rd with 6-5 and was very 
        close to getting 6-7. Rajter had the only season best, jumping 6-3 for 7th 
        and nearly clearing 6-5.
    
    
      
    
    The thinned out runner's field for MIT, missing All American, 
        Brian Anderson, for the season with an injured achilles tendon, Steve Stoddard 
        with a torn plantar fascia, Carlos Renjifo in the 3000SC also with plantar 
        fascitis, and missing Hoying from the 400 due to previous leg injuries, still 
        managed to score 119 points, despite pulling numerous runners from the meet 
        once the win was secure, including the 4x400 relay. 
    
    
      
    
    The strongest running event for the Engineers was the 110HH. 
        All four MIT runners ran a season best with Mielcarz and Chris Peterson hurdling 
        to personal bests. Rajter led Tech hurdlers with a 2nd place in 15.23 and 
        was followed by Mielcarz in 3rd, 15.48, Peterson in 4th, 15.74 and Williamson 
        in 7th, 16.04.
    
    
      
    
    The 400IH was also strong for MIT with Peterson running a season 
        best of 56.04 and Williamson close behind in 56.14. Steve Kannan knocked 3 
        seconds off his personal best, running 61.33 for 7th.
    
    
      
    
    The sprinters appreciated the warm weather and slight tailwind 
        as all three MIT sprinters had season bests in both the 100 and 200 meter 
        dashes. Zach Traina showed championship form, placing 2nd in the 100 with 
        a 11.10 performance and 22.56 in the 200 to place 3rd. David Blau and Marc 
        Washington gave support as Washington placed 6th in the 200 (22.86) and 8th 
        in the 100 in 11.38. Blau placed 7th in the 100 with a 11.32, although he 
        ran 11.25 in the trials.
    
    
      
    
    Two first time performers did very well in the 400 and 800 meter 
        events. Rajter was moved from the 400IH to the open 400 and the gamble paid 
        off. Rajter went out a little conservatively, but ran strong in the middle, 
        running 50.86 to place 4th in the talented field. Fivos Constantinou came 
        back from a season best in the 1500 at 4:07.08 and ran a great 800, placing 
        8th with a 2:00.11.
    
    
      
    
    MIT had three scorers in the 1500. Leading the way was Sean 
        Nolan at 4:03.29 in 3rd place. Running a personal best and placing 4th was 
        John Brewer in 4:03.57. Constantinou placed 7th with his 4:07 performance.
    
    
      
    
    The distance events were dominated by the Engineers but not 
        quite as much as in past years. In the 3000SC, minus Renjifo, Ben Schmeckpeper 
        and Craig Wildman placed 2-3 respectively, running 9:44.95 and 9:54.82. In 
        the 5000 meter race, Sean Nolan doubled back from the 1500 and won easily, 
        taking it easy in 15:35.31. Steve Maltas, just getting back in shape, ran 
        15:51.06 for a personal best and 2nd place. Finally, in the 10K, rookie, David 
        Gray scored 8 points by placing 2nd in 35:57.76 in his first race since a 
        February injury sidelined him. Gray was supported by Greg Fonder and David 
        Newell in 7th and 8th respectively.
    
    
      
    
    The next task for Tech is to try and match their indoor performance 
        at the New England Division III Championship at Bates College on 5/1-5/3. 
        Williams College is the favorite but MIT has a chance if everything goes their 
        way.

    **MIELCARZ AND KHAN LEAD ENGINEERS TO 
    VICTORY IN TEXAS**
    
    
       
    
    MARCH 29, 2003
    
    
       
      
    
    MIT's men's track and field team put an exclamation point to 
        the end of a great week spent at the University of Texas at Pan American in 
        Edinburg, Texas with a victory over UTPA and the University of Texas A&M 
        at Corpus Christi. MIT scored 141 points to 136 for A&M and 79 for UTPA.
    
    
       
    
    Venturing in Texas for the first time on a spring break trip,
         the track team was looking for good weather and good competition. They got
         both as they dealt with 80 degree temperatures with low humidity all week.
         The meet day was only 70 degrees and began with cloudy weather but it was
         probably better that way so the effects from the sun were lessened on such
         a long day.
    
    
       
    
    The meet was scored as a tri-meet by NCAA rules, which meant
         each team was allowed two scorers per event with awarded points 
    being 7-5-4-3-2-1
         and relays scoring 7-5-0.
    
    
       
    
    Craig Mielcarz was the leading scorer for the Engineers with
         23 points. Mielcarz won both the high jump (6-7 1/2) and the long 
    jump (21-10
         3/4), placed 2nd in the javelin (144-5) and 3rd in the110HH (15.91). Chris
         Khan did not score as many points, but he did earn two victories 
    and qualified
         for nationals in both events. Khan began the day with a personal 
    best of 187-4
         in the hammer and followed it with another national qualifying performance
         of 163-2 in the discus. The discus throw was truly a remarkable throw as it
         was with the wind, the worst case scenario for a good discus 
    throw. Khan also
         placed 3rd in the shot put with another personal best of 45-9 for a total
         of 18 points.
    
    
       
    
    Field events carried the day for MIT, particularly 
    the throwing
         events, all of which MIT won. Uzoma Orji set the freshman record in winning
         the shot put with a throw of 51-6. Orji had a fine day for his 
    first collegiate
         outdoor track meet. In addition to winning the shot put he also placed 3rd
         in the discus with a 127-5 effort and threw 140-3 in the hammer. 
    Dale Cotton
         won the javelin with a throw into the wind of 162-1. David Saylor did his
         part by placing 3rd in the hammer with a heave of 157-6.
    
    
       
    
    In the jumps, Brian Hoying showed he is back from his broken
         foot with 6-5 1/2 in the high jump for 3rd place and 21-0 1/2 in the long
         jump to tie for third. In the triple jump Rick Rajter placed 3rd with 41-9
         and Victor Williamson 4th with 40-6 1/2. Nate Ball could not make the trip
         to compete in the pole vault as is hamstring is still healing.
    
    
       
    
    Texas A&M Corpus Christi dominated the running 
    events, particularly
         the sprints. MIT's wins in the running events were only in the 
    distance events.
         All of the times were slow as the runners had to deal with a ferocious wind
         in the circular events and running into the wind in the sprints. 
    Ben Schmeckpeper
         took first place honors in the 3000 steeplechase with a 9:54.30. 
    He was followed
         by Craig Wildman in 2nd with a 9:55.19. Sean Nolan won the 5000 in 15:24.83
         after placing 3rd in the 1500 with a 4:08.03.
    
    
       
    
    MIT faired well in the hurdle events as freshman 
    Chris Peterson
         placed 2nd in both the 110HH and the 400IH, running 15.78 and 
    56.91 respectively.
         Williamson also placed in the 400IH, running a fine time of 57.96.
    
    
       
    
    In the sprints, Zach Traina ran 11.69 in the 100 to place 4th
         and 23.27 in the 200 for another 4th place. David Blau placed 3rd 
    in the 100
         when he ran 11.58. Marc Washington earned 5th place in the 200 with a time
         of 23.55.
    
    
       
    
    In addition to his jumping efforts, Hoying placed 4th in the
         400, running 53.70. Placing right behind Hoying was Thad Wozniak, who ran
         54.89. 
    
    
       
    
    Steve Stoddard placed 4th in the 800 with a 2:06.53 
    and George
         Hanson ran a 2:07.42 for 5th. Neither relay team placed in the meet. In the
         400 relay the final exchange never happened, disqualifying the team and in
         the 1600 relay, the time of 3:27.70 was not good enough to get 
    the job done.
    
    
       
    
    Next Saturday, MIT hosts the Engineers Cup against
