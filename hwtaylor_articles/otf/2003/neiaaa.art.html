  <p><strong><font size="4">Men's Track Places in Tie for 11th at NEICAAA Championship 
    With Partial Team</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">MAY 9-10, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">MIT traveled to the University of New Hampshire for the All 
    Division New England Championship (NEIcAAA) and finished in a tie for 11th 
    place despite traveling with a partial squad. Throwers and jumpers scored 
    27 points collectively, led by a 2nd place finish by Chris Khan in the hammer 
    throw with a toss of 190-6.</p>
  <p align="left">Due to the fact that many students at MIT have final projects 
    due this week and next, combined with the fact that last weekend was spent 
    away from campus at Bates College, most of the track team who had qualified 
    for this meet, particularly Marios Michalakis (hammer) and Chris Peterson 
    (400IH) elected to catch up academically back at MIT. In addition to the academic 
    side of things, Nate Ball had to miss the trip due to an illness that may 
    be a case of strep throat and Nestor Hernandez had to miss because of an soar 
    heel.</p>
  <p align="left">After the New England Division III Championship, all other championship 
    meets are optional for the MIT team and they can choose what events they would 
    like to do. Craig Mielcarz, elected to just do the high jump even though he 
    was also qualified in the long jump. Mielcarz got good height on his last 
    attempt at 6-09, but had to settle for 5th place with 6-07. Brian Hoying did 
    not miss through 6-07 and placed third.</p>
  <p align="left">As has been the case all season, the throwers came through despite 
    the absence of Michalakis, who surely would have scored in the hammer and 
    the fact that Chris Khan did not throw the shot put and fouled out of the 
    discus when he was not aggressive enough with his reverse.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji had some big warmups over 55' but was only able to 
    throw 52-4 3/4 in the competition of the shot put, good enough for 4th place. 
    Greg Walker continued his great season with a 151-11 discus throw for 5th 
    place.</p>
  <p align="left">The runners did not fair so well. Zach Traina showed his fatigue 
    from last weekend's competition, not making the finals in either the 100 or 
    200 meter dashes. Sean Nolan ran pretty well but not good enough in the 5000 
    to place or improve his time. Ben Schmeckpeper stuttered on nearly every hurdle, 
    exhausting himself and preventing a good performance as he finished 10th in 
    the steeplechase.</p>
  <p align="left">Next Thursday and Friday at the ECAC Championship hosted by 
    MIT, these same competitors, as well as those who missed this meet will try 
    to improve their national marks in hopes of making it to the NCAA Championship 
    the following week. </p>
