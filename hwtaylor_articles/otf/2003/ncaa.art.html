  <p><strong><font size="4">3 ALL AMERICA WINNERS PACE MIT TO 16TH PLACE FINISH 
    AT NATIONALS</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 22-24, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">Chris Khan led MIT's scoring at the NCAA Division III Championship, 
    held at St. Lawrence University, with a 3rd place in the Hammer Throw and 
    a 5th in the Discus Throw. Brian Hoying added a tie for 4th in the High Jump 
    to complete MIT's total of 14.5 points, good for 16th place at the National 
    Championship.</p>
  <p align="left">The first event in the championship was the men's discus on 
    Thursday morning. Khan was the last seed in the 16 person field with an entering 
    mark of 163-2. Khan never considered anything put trying to win this event. 
    After watching the first flight perform poorly, Khan unleashed his best throw 
    and a new MIT record with a 171-0 on his second throw of the second flight 
    to put him in 5th place going into the finals. The positions in the finals 
    did not change, earning Khan his 2nd All America honor in the discus.</p>
  <p align="left">Later that day, Brian Hoying and Craig Mielcarz began their 
    quest to place in the top 8 in the High Jump. Both looked very good in the 
    warmups, easily clearing what would be the opening height of 6-5. When the 
    competition began, both cleared 6-5 on the first attempt. Only 1 athlete went 
    out at the opening height, but at 6-7 four more left the competition. Mielcarz 
    made it on his first attempt but Hoying needed two tries to make the height. 
    At 6-9, Mielcarz, a 4 time All America in this event, was not his usual self, 
    missing on all three attempts. Unfortunately, 8 jumpers cleared the height, 
    putting Mielcarz out of placing by 1 position. Hoying made the height on his 
    2nd attempt, putting him in a tie for 4th if no one behind him cleared 6-11. 
    Hoying made a couple of good attempts at 6-11, but was not able to clear the 
    height. While two cleared 6-11 and one 7-1, neither were behind Hoying before 
    clearing the height, placing him in a tie for 4th and giving MIT 8.5 points 
    for the day.</p>
  <p align="left">On Friday afternoon, Khan returned to competition, this time 
    in the Hammer Throw. The hammer is an event that Khan had competed in at two 
    other nationals but had only finished with one 8th place finish. This year, 
    Khan entered the competition as the 2nd seed with a best of 195-11 and was 
    determined to finish well. His first throw hit the closed left side gate solidly 
    and still went 170'. On his second throw he bombed one 192-3 to move into 
    2nd place. In the finals, Khan could not improve, but was passed by the indoor 
    weight throw champion, and had to settle for 3rd place.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT will graduate Hoying and Mielcarz but will return Khan as 
    well as indoor All American, Brian Anderson, cross country All American, Ben 
    Schmeckpeper, and national qualifiers, Nate Ball in the Pole Vault, Marios 
    Michalakis and David Saylor in the Hammer Throw, Uzoma Orji in the Shot Put 
    and Zach Traina in the 200. Combine this with the numerous other conference 
    place winners and what seems to be a strong incoming freshman class and MIT 
    may well improve their 16th place finish next year.</p>
