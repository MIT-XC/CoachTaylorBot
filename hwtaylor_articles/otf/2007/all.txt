    May 18, 2007
    
    
      
    
    Over 20 colleges from the New England and surrounding area competed in the NCAA approved Last Chance Qualifier hosted by MIT on this, the final day to attain a nationally qualifying mark for the NCAA Division III Championships. Despite the non-spring like weather, quite a few individuals were able to reach that standard and move on to the Championship being held next week at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.
    
    
      
    
    For the MIT men's team, only Omari Stephens was able to crack the qualifying list with an improved mark. Stephens improved his personal best for the second week in succession, clearing 15-7 1/4 to place him third all time among MIT pole vaulters. Stephen's winning vault put him in a possible position to be selected for the championship field, which will be determined on Sunday.
    
    
      
    
    Yermie Cohen won the 1500 with an excellently executed come from behind victory, but the wind and rain derailed the opportunity for a fast time. Cohen's 3:59.00 was an excellent performance given the conditions.
    
    
      
    
    Three MIT men's track and field members have provisionally qualified for the NCAA Division III Championship; Eric Khatchadourian in the 10,000 (31:08. 23), Stephen Morton in the triple jump (46-04) and Omari Stephens (15-07 1/4).
    
    
      
    
    While the chances of the MIT men's team qualifying an athlete for the championships seems slim, it would only be the second outdoor NCAA championship in the past 25 years that an MIT men's track and field athlete has not made the elite field. Regardless, the team has had an amazingly successful season, again finishing undefeated and winning their seventh consecutive conference championship. The freshmen led the way in scoring by more than double any other class. With only five seniors graduating the team and MIT this year, the future looks very bright for the Engineers.

    **TREMENDOUS TEAM EFFORT IN NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP NETS FOURTH PLACE**
    
    
      
    
    May 4-5, 2007
    
    
      
    
    In past years, those few times when MIT finished out of the top three teams in the New England Division III Championship it was generally because the team performed poorly in many of the events, and even then barely missed being among the top three. This year, MIT was seeded fourth behind Williams College, Tufts University and Springfield College going into the meet. Tech athletes performed very well, scoring 22 points more than they were seeded until freshman sensation, Stephen Morton, tweaked his hamstring, making it difficult to get a good triple jump in and impossible to compete in the 200, losing 10 seed points. Even so, when a team scores 12 more points than they were seeded and still does not catch the teams seeded in front, then fate must be accepted. Williams won the meet with 137 1/2 points. Tufts was second with 91 1/2, Springfield third with 89 and MIT fourth with 79, 18 2/3 points ahead of Coast Guard in fifth. 
    
    
      
    
    What has become a two-day meet for the non multi-event part of the meet due to the relaxed standards and combining of the men's and women's meet, served MIT well as the early events saw the Engineers walk away with 30 points after just two events competed by Tech athletes.
    
    
      
    
    In the first event, the 10,000 meters, MIT was seeded to score 18 points in the 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 scoring format. On a windy evening, Eric Khatchadourian tried to decide whether or not to run for a national qualifying time or sit back and try to let others do the work. At the last minute the wind appeared to die down and the decision to go for a fast time was made. Khatch let the excitement get the best of him and ran 71 seconds for the first 400 and 4:51 for the first mile. The wind had picked up and combined with the fast pace spelled doom for any hope for a national qualifying time. Now the goal was how to maintain first place. Khatch did not relinquish first place until the final mile and still held on to second despite the wind and fatigue. One could say Khatch took one for the team. His early fast pace spread out the 26 member field and allowed the MIT runners to group together and work on the runners who tried to catch Khatch. After five miles MIT was holding onto second place as well as fourth, fifth and sixth, just trailing a Bates College runner in third trying to shake the MIT trio. The Tech runners, Trevor Rundell (32:38.47), Chris Wong (32:39.66), and Brian Jacokes (32:47.14), applied great kicks leaving the Bates competitor behind to secure 2-3-4-5 places, netting 23 points.
    
    
      
    
    About the same time, the long jump was taking place. Morton went to work and leaped 22-3 1/2 right away in the second flight and Anthony Teixeira jumped 21-11 for a personal best that won the first flight and put him in the finals. The field was outstanding so that even with these marks MIT only garnered fifth and sixth place. However, that was still two points more than they were seeded to score, putting MIT seven points up.
    
    
      
    
    On day two, Teixeira, seeded eighth in the 110HH, combined with Omari Stephens, who was not seeded to score, to make finals. Stephens ran a personal best of 15.37 in the trials for the third best time in the field. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Stephens finished fifth in another PR at 15.23 for fifth place and Teixeira set his own personal best, good for sixth place in 15.35. MIT was now up 13 points and figured they had a good chance at second place.
    
    
      
    
    In the 100 trials, Morton ran easy, finishing second in his heat to make finals. In the finals, the volume of work over the past two weeks caught up with him as his hamstring seized up a little at the end even though he ran 10.89 for fifth place. Fifth place was what Morton was seeded to get so no loss of points occurred but the potential loss of triple jump and 200 points was huge.
    
    
      
    
    Johannes Schneider went out with the leaders in the 3000 steeplechase and despite his poor hurdle technique was able to stay with them through the 5:00 mile. The extra energy expended over the barriers caught up with Schneider and he dropped off the lead group, running 80 second laps for the next 800 meters. In the final 600 meters he picked up the pace to move into fifth and despite tripping over the final barrier he held on for a 9:32.84 to gain two points over his seed, putting MIT up 15 points.
    
    
      
    
    The 400 relay was the first event where MIT did not match their seed. Seeded eighth, the quartet of Liam Fedus, Chris Bateman, Teixeira and Morton got out pretty well and had a successful first handoff. The second handoff was probably affected by the strong headwind and Bateman's aggravated hip flexor, which served to throw off the handoff mark, forcing Teixeira to nearly stop at the end of the zone in order to receive the baton. The final handoff to Morton was solid but it was too late to score, running 43.74, finishing in ninth place.
    
    
      
    
    Tech was not down for long. Yermie Cohen, not seeded to score in the 1500, went out in the back of the lead pack, running a low 63 for the first quarter. The pack settled a little for the second quarter and Cohen moved to the middle of the pack, coming through in 2:08. The pace picked up in the third quarter and Cohen went with them, running a 62 400 and moving into the top five. Cohen did not slow down in the final 300, moving up to fourth place in a personal best time of 3:57.29.
    
    
      
    
    In the pole vault, MIT had two of the top seeds, all having cleared 14-8 3/4 during the season. In a pleasant surprise, Patrick Barragan, not seeded to score, tied for sixth with a personal best of 13-4 1/4. Stephens did not have his usual best day and bowed out after 13-10, placing fifth. Greg Tao, a freshman, secured the only individual championship for MIT, clearing a new personal best of 14-10 to give MIT 16 points in the event.
    
    
      
    
    James Oleinik, seeded fourth in the shot put, threw a personal best of his own to move into third for most of the competition. However, his 49-7 3/4 put did not hold up, but it did get him the fourth place he was supposed to get.
    
    
      
    
    The good news continued on the track. Liam Fedus, running his second 800 ever, ran a flawless race to finish fourth. Fedus was not supposed to score but he was determined to get the job done for the team. The windy conditions continued and put a damper on the early pace. Fedus was in the main pack, coming through the first 400 in 56 seconds. Moving well down the backstretch, Fedus waited until 150 meters were left before he sprinted home in 1:55.81.
    
    
      
    
    At this point it was known Morton was having difficulty in the triple jump. Even though he jumped 43-11 3/4, he missed finals and was not able to run the 200. Teixeira jumped 44- 3 1/4, but even with that jump was only able to secure eighth place. This was only the second event where MIT did not score what they were seeded for.
    
    
      
    
    Once again, the team responded positively and never gave up. Hemagiri Arumugam, seeded 19th in the 5000, was determined to score. He came through the first mile in 4:48, gradually moving up to the lead pack. By mile two he had come through in 9:41 and caught the back of the leaders. The next 1200 meters Arumugam lost focus, running 78 second quarters and falling out of the top group. With 600 to go he could sense there was a chance to score and that was all he needed. Running 1:41 for the final lap and a half, Arumugam sprinted into seventh place in 15:15.9 for a new personal best.
    
    
      
    
    In the final event, the starter did not wait until MIT was in the blocks, firing the gun and stunning Stephen Oney. Oney knelt down before realizing the race was on. By the time Oney had left he was already two seconds down. His 52.0 leg was really a 50 flat but MIT was in last. Matt Bieniosek, Ulzie Rea and Liam Fedus kept running too fast for the first 200, trying to get their team back into the race, but only making matters worse. Seeded fifth, the team did not score despite the valiant effort.
    
    
      
    
    This was truly an amazing team effort for the men's track team. Finishing fourth with such outstanding performances just shows the quality of this meet and the teams involved. MIT has a lot to build on next year as the freshmen scored 29 of the 79 points and only eight points were scored by seniors. 
    
    
      
    
    Next week those MIT athletes who qualify and wish to extend their season will travel to Dartmouth College for the NEICAAA Championship on Friday and Saturday.

    **STEPHENS LEADS ENGINEERS WITH POLE VAULT PR**
    
    
      
    
    May 12
    
    
      
    
    A small contingent of the MIT track and field team competed this weekend  in the NEICAAA Championship, the All Division New England Championship, being hosted by Dartmouth College. With finals approaching, the toll taken by the past two weeks of team championships, combined with challenging performance standards, many MIT athletes elected to call it a season. 
    
    
      
    
    Of those who went, no one took advantage of his one event any better than Omari Stephens in the pole vault. Stephens moved up to number five on the MIT all-time outdoor list by clearing 15-4 1/2 and placing third. Having missed one attempt at both 13-9 and 14-3, Stephens looked anything but capable of scoring in this meet. However, by 14-9 he got things together and made first attempts at 15-1 and 15-4 1/2. Stephens nearly cleared 15-8 on his second attempt, a height that would have qualified him provisionally for the NCAA Division III Championship. Teammate Greg Tao, with the quite the opposite trend, made first attempts at 13-9, 14-3 and 14-9, looking better as the heights progressed. However, at 15-1 he was not able to make it work, missing the scoring spots by one place.
    
    
      
    
    Also competing after feeling "broken" all week, was Joe Roy-Mayhew in the 10,000 meters. Wanting to give it one last effort and hoping to score, Roy-Mayhew ran a patient and controlled pace of 5:08 through the first four miles. As he started to fatigue so too did those who went out in front of him. His pace dropped to 5:14 for mile five and 5:20 for mile six but still he gained ground and places on the spread out field. With 200 to go, Roy-Mayhew could not summon the speed necessary to catch the runner in front of him preventing him from scoring. Finishing in 32:22.86, Roy-Mayhew missed a personal best by .73 seconds and eighth place by 2.81 seconds, a very valiant effort.
    
    
      
    
    On day two, Yermie Cohen started things off in the 1500. Following the leaders through laps of 61, 2:04 and 3:07 Cohen easily set a 1200 best. Although he wasted energy fighting with the tight group of runners and nearly falling down from a trip in the process, Cohen managed a 48 final 300 for the third personal best in as many weeks. His 3:55.33 narrowly missed the NCAA provisional qualifying mark in the event.
    
    
      
    
    James Oleinik competed in the shot put even though his finger was injured. Throwing with caution, Oleinik just missed making finals, throwing 48-6 3/4 for his final effort of the season.
    
    
      
    
    Liam Fedus and Matt Bieniosek took to the track in the 800 meter race, both seeded in the slowest of four sections with 1:55.81 and 1:55.82 respectively. The first quarter was a pedestrian 58.2 for both runners. Fedus, took off after the leaders, taking the lead with a little over 100 meters to go and finishing in first with a time of 1:55.44, a new personal best. Bieniosek fatigued and finished in a respectable 1:57.56.
    
    
      
    
    In the final event for Tech, Stephen Morton and Anthony Teixeira competed in the triple jump. Morton, back after a tight hamstring forced him out of the 200 the week before, made it out of the unseeded flight to make finals and finish fifth overall with a new personal of best of 46-4. Teixeira suffering through a sore knee and heel, could not make the finals, jumping 43-8 1/2.
    
    
      
    
    MIT tied for 20th among all New England colleges with 10 points. Next week a few Engineers will compete at home in the Last Chance Qualifier on Friday.

    **MORTON LEADS MIT TO SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE NEWMAC TITLE**
    
    
      
    
    April 28, 2007
    
    
      
    
    MIT managed to beat out Springfield College by a score of 247 to 210 in the NEWMAC Outdoor Track and Field Championship to secure their seventh consecutive title. In a meet that could have gone either way, the strength of MIT's distance events, horizontal jumps and the individual domination by freshman Stephen Morton made the difference. The remaining scores were Coast Guard 162, WPI 92, Wheaton College 32 and Babson College 16. 
    
    
      
    
    MIT seized an early lead with the 10K, battled back and forth between Springfield dominating the throws and shorter races and MIT dominating the jumps and longer races. With just the discus, 5000 and 4x400 remaining, MIT held a narrow 203 to 182 lead. With Springfield earning 20 points in the discus, MIT needed to maximize their points in the 5K since Springfield had two entrants in the event. The 5000 locked up the victory and sent MIT looking ahead to the Championships ahead. 
    
    
      
    
    Morton started his day off by anchoring the 4x100 team to a come from behind victory over Springfield and a season best time of 43.22. He proceeded to place first in the long jump with a 21-11 effort on only two jumps. Taking a break from the horizontal jumps, he ran the trials and final of the 100 taking his only second place of the day as he ran into a strong wind in 11.32, far off his 10.88 season best. Coming back to the triple jump, Morton fouled his first two and then got in a jump that barely made it into finals as he was two feet behind the board. Recovering from the 100 final, Morton fouled his first two in the finals of the triple jump but put his best jump together on his last effort, moving into first place with a personal best, national provisional qualifying mark of 46-3 1/2. The meet was still on the line when he lined up against the other sprinters in the seeded section of the 200, where four of the entrants were from Springfield, including the winner of the 100. Morton ran a conservative curve then brought it home hard, winning in a lean at 22.19. Including his share of the 10 points for first in the 4x100, Morton scored 40 1/2 points for the Engineers, outscoring two of the teams in the meet.
    
    
      
    
    Each team is allowed four entries per event in the championship and MIT maximized their points in the 10,000 meters to go along with the 5000 by sweeping the first four places in each. Running a calculated race plan that was a relatively slow early pace the Engineers were able to work together throughout the first two miles of the 5K and the first four miles of the 10K before doing any racing. In the 5K, Christopher Wong led the way with a 15:24.31 time, running a 2:16 final 800 meters. Trevor Rundell ran away with the 10K title in 32:59.63. Wong was supported by Joe Roy-Mayhew (15:30.58), Eric Khatchadourian (15:33.04) and Hemagiri Arumugam in 15:34.34. Rundell was assisted by Jack Bourbonnais (33:11.04), Brian Jacokes (33:18.82) and Tyler Abrams (33:35.15) 
    
    
      
    
    Morton won both horizontal jumps but had a large supporting cast. Placing second in the long jump and fifth in the triple jump, Chris Bateman leaped to two personal bests with marks of 21-8 3/4 and 44-6. Anthony Teixeira also jumped to two personal bests when he placed third in the long jump and second in the triple jump with jumps of 21-6 3/4 and 45-10 1/2 to move to number nine on the all-time MIT triple jump list. Obinna Anyanwu placed seventh in the long jump at 19-11 1/2 and sixth in the triple with 43-4 1/2.
    
    
      
    
    MIT also had individual victories in the pole vault, 1500 and 3000 steeplechase. In the vault, freshman Greg Tao, led the way with another 14-8 3/4 effort. Patrick Barragan and Nate Sharpe tied for fifth at 12-9, a personal best for Sharpe. Yermie Cohen ran a personal best of 3:58.57 to score a three second personal best and a major upset over the favorite from Springfield. Arumugam placed fourth in 4:03.75 and Khatchadourian won the slow section to place sixth overall in 4:04.29. Johannes Schneider, another freshman, won the steeplechase fairly easily, running away from the field in the first two laps and holding on for a 9:44.19 victory. Chris Bruce placed third in 10:04.76 and Kevin DiGenova finished fourth in 10:08.74.
    
    
      
    
    While not dominating their event, crucial points were scored by James Oleinik and Tony McDonald in the discus. An event heavily favored towards Springfield, Oleinik and McDonald stopped the bleeding by placing fourth and fifth with two personal bests of 135-4 and 132-10 respectively. Oleinik also placed third in the shot put with a throw of 48-2 1/2.
    
    
      
    
    While not winning their events, the 400 and 800 runners represented themselves very well. Liam Fedus led the way in the 400 with a fourth place 50.21, followed by Stephen Oney in 51.54 for seventh and Ulzie Rea in 51.69 for eighth. Matt Bieniosek mistimed his kick just slightly and got caught just before the finish to place third in the 800 in 1:58.34. Bill Phipps braved the headwind at the end of the first lap and paid the price, placing fourth in 1:59.05. Yermie Cohen double back from the 1500, running 1:59.92 for sixth.
    
    
      
    
    In the hurdle events, Teixeira added to his jumping points by securing a second into the wind in 15.69. Aron Walker sprinted and jumped his way to a seventh place finish in the 400IH in 58.51.
    
    
      
    
    To close out the meet, MIT ran their best 4x400 relay by over four seconds this season. Oney led off with a very fine 51.3 to put MIT in the thick of it. Bieniosek ran 51.1 to keep Tech in position. Rea ran a great 50.4 but faded just enough to give Coast Guard and Springfield the lead at the handoff, which caused Fedus to run into the back of the finishing Coast Guard runner. This killed his momentum and made it too much for him to catch up despite his 50.0 leg. MIT finished in third with a 3:23.08. 
    
    
      
    
    Next week MIT travels to Springfield for the New England Division III Championships being run on Friday evening and all day Saturday. With Williams and Tufts seeded one and two MIT hopes to break into the trophy group with a third place finish but will look to upset any team not performing its best.

    **MIT OPENS THE SEASON WITH BIG PERFORMANCES**
    
    
      
    
    March 31, 2007
    
    
      
    
    After a week in Florida of 80 degree plus temperatures and nothing but sun everyday, the track and field team finally started the competitive part of the outdoor season today with outstanding performances and a victory against New England neighbor, Colby College and a few local athletes. The practices and meet were hosted by the National Training Center in Clermont, Florida. 
    
    
      
    
    The team spent the week through difficult two-a-day workouts and hard lifting sessions yet when the time came to compete, the athletes shrugged off the fatigue, ignored the heat and took care of business.
    
    
      
    
    Leading the performance parade was freshman Stephen Morton. He jumped 22-7 in the long jump, took one jump in the triple and went 45-7 1/4, ran the 100 into the 20 mph wind in 11.31 and anchored the 4x100 to a 43.57 time despite terrible handoffs. The triple jump was the premier event of the day, dominating the top six places. After Morton was Anthony Teixeira, who jumped 44-9 and had his ankle give out on a jump that would have been in the 46 foot range had he been able to finish it. Obinna Anyanwu followed with a 43-4 1/4 for third, Omari Stephens 42-5 1/2, Chris Bateman with 42-0 1/2 and Tim Humpton at 39-8 3/4.
    
    
      
    
    Stephens cleared 14-6 in the pole vault and ran 15.98 into the stiff wind prior to his triple jump. Teixeira ran a leg on the 4x100, ran a personal best 15.88 despite running into the wind and long jumped 21-2 prior to his triple jump. Bateman also did well, jumping 21-2 and also running a leg on the 4x100. 
    
    
      
    
    Liam Fedus, another freshman, won the collegiate 400 with a 50.99, led off the 4x100 with a solid leg and anchored the winning 4x400 with a 51.5 leg. Freshman Bill Phipps won the 800 with a 1:59.27 and ran a leg on the 4x400 relay.
    
    
      
    
    Freshman Johannes Schneider led a trio of Tech runners in the steeplechase to a 1-2-4 finish. The rookie ran a 10:15.16 after a very conservative start, leading Chris Bruce (10:32.12) and Rocco Repetski (11:19.10) to the finish line.
    
    
      
    
    Eric Khatchadourian led a 1-2-3 sweep in the 5000, running 15:36.0 despite the hot weather. Gaining second place was Joe Roy-Mayhew in 15:52 and Hemu Arumugam in 15:55.
    
    
      
    
    Representing MIT well in the throws were James Oleinik and Tony McDonald. Oleinik won the shot and hammer with throws of 45-4 1/4 and 128-7 respectively and threw the discus 118-11. McDonald threw the discus 128-5, a fine mark for a freshman, threw the hammer 121-9 and put the shot 37-8 1/2.
    
    
      
    
    Next week the Engineers travel to Troy, NY to go against RPI and WPI in the annual Engineer's Cup.

    MIT FINISHES REGULAR SEASON UNDEFEATED
    
    
      
    
    **Meet Highlighted by Three Freshman Records**
    
    
      
    
    April 14, 2007
    
    
      
    
    The unusually cool and windy weather continued in the Northeast and MIT's track was not excluded from the brisk 50 degree temperatures. The Engineers endured the conditions and put up some truly remarkable marks including three freshman records en route to a convincing victory with 262 points over Bates College (191), Colby College (91), University of Southern Maine (85) and Colby-Sawyer College (43). The scoring system used for the five way meet was 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 for the individual events and 9-7-6-5 for the relays. 
    
    
      
    
    Freshman sensation, Stephen Morton had a career day, setting two freshman records, winning three events, getting second in another and anchored the winning 4x100 relay team. Morton began his day with the long jump and despite his difficulty in finding the board he still managed a 22-8 season best victory. Before he began the triple jump he anchored the relay with a leg where he pulled away from the other anchor legs for the duration of the 100 meters. Coming over to the triple, Morton could not quite put all three phases together, finishing second based on second best jumps as he tied with teammate Anthony Teixeira for best jump at 43-6. During the triple jump Morton took a break and took first place honors in a freshman record of 10.88, eclipsing Zach Traina's record from 2002. After the triple jump, Morton got ready for the 200. Despite the drop in temperature as the clouds set in, Morton ran to another freshman record of 21.91, again taking away a record held by Traina from 2002. Morton's point total was 36 1/4 points for the day. 
    
    
      
    
    Tech's next highest point scorer was Teixeira, who garnered two firsts, one second and ran the third leg on the winning 4x100 relay. Despite hitting quite a few hurdles, Teixeira out leaned teammate Omari Stephens for a personal best 15.53. In the long jump, Teixeira had a season best 21-3 1/4 for second place. In the 4x100, even though he got out very late in the acceleration zone, once he received the baton he quickly outdistanced the field to give Morton a comfortable lead.
    
    
      
    
    The Engineers won five other events for a total of 10 event victories of the 19 competed. Earning the other freshman record was Liam Fedus. After a great start to the indoor season, Fedus had to watch the rest of the season from the sideline with a foot injury. Back in shape and ready to race, Fedus ran a very well paced race to cross the line in 50.07 despite the strong winds to take down former national champion, Mark Dunzo's record of 50.13. Fedus also ran the opening leg on the 4x100 and a 23.37 200 good for fifth place.
    
    
      
    
    Another freshman, Bill Phipps, took control of the 800 over the final 200 meters to run away with a 1:58.14 personal best victory. Phipps also ran a 52.9 leg on the 4x400 relay that earned third place. The final freshman victory was earned by Greg Tao, who cleared 14-2 3/4 for the victory. Tao had good attempts at 14-9, showing there is much more to come as the team heads into the championships in two weeks.
    
    
      
    
    Sophomore shot putter, James Oleinik had a strong series of throws as four of them would have won the event. His 48-11 was a personal best. Oleinik also earned scoring places in the hammer with a fifth place and the discus with a sixth place.
    
    
      
    
    The final victory of the day was earned by senior Eric Khatchadourian. Taking the lead after 800 meters, Khatch ran an aggressive race given the strong winds, coming through both the first two miles in 4:56 and then adding a 4:54 final mile before sprinting home, covering the final 200 meters in 34 seconds for the 15:10.4 victory.
    
    
      
    
    MIT claimed five of the eight places in three events, long jump, triple jump and 5000 meters, scoring 26, 27 and 25 points respectively in the three events. The only event in which the Engineers did not score was in the javelin, an event in which they did not have an entry.
    
    
      
    
    Next Saturday, MIT plays host to 15 men's and women's teams at the MIT Spring Invitational.

    **Morton Sets Another Freshman Record**

    New England track and field finally witnessed the arrival of spring on Saturday with temperatures in the 70s and sunny skies, although a sometimes strong and shifting wind was troublesome for the track athletes. MIT athletes responded with numerous personal bests, including five top 10 all-time performances. In all, 15 men's and women's teams showed up to compete at the MIT Spring Invitational. 
    
    
      
    
    Stephen Morton again led the way, despite not being able to hold any food down since the day before. Morton opened up with a casual 21-7 1/2 in the long jump and anchored the 4x100 team before moving to his first ever 400 meter race. Morton went out a little fast but was nevertheless in control as he came through the 200 in low 23, probably saying to himself that he should be finishing about now. Taking over the lead in the third 100, Morton hit the homestretch along with a wall of wind. Morton still pulled away, finishing in first and with a new freshman record of 49.02, taking down William Fedus's week long record of 50.07. Morton's time was good for seventh on the MIT all-time list. 
    
    
      
    
    In the pole vault, the lads backed-up their new mohawk haircuts with season or personal bests across the board. Omari Stephens upped his top-10 performance with a 14-8 3/4 victory. Freshman, Greg Tao, tied with Stephens at 14-8 3/4 but lost on misses. Both Stephens and Tao are now tied for 9th on the all-time list. Patrick Barragan tied his personal best and set an outdoor best with a 13-3 vault and Nate Sharpe jumped to an outdoor best of 12-3 1/4.
    
    
      
    
    Another freshman, Johannes Schneider, took the lead in the 3000 Steeplechase and never looked back, winning in a personal best of 9:31.61 to make number 10 on the all-time MIT list. Schneider should move up the list quickly once he gets to the competition of the championships.
    
    
      
    
    The final top-10 mark was made by Eric Khatchadourian in the 10K. Khatch moved up to number six on the all-time list, qualified provisionally for nationals and missed IC4A qualifying by .23 seconds. Joe Roy-Mayhew provided company for Khatch through 2800 meters but from that point on it was Khatch against the clock. Running 1600 splits of 5:02, 4:54, 4:58, 4:57, 5:05 and 5:02, Khatch was still able to kick in a 70 second final quarter to easily win the race. MIT had four other 10K runners under 33:00; Roy-Mayhew in 32:22.13, Hemu Arumugam in 32:25.24, Chris Wong in 32:29.48 and Trevor Rundell in 32:41.81 as MIT swept the first five places.
    
    
      
    
    MIT added two more runners to the growing list of sub-16:00 5K runners for the season. Yermie Cohen ran a personal best of 15:43.11 to place third and freshman, Jack Bourbonnais, ran 15:53.28 to become number seven among the nine MIT runners who have broken 16:00 for the season.
    
    
      
    
    Similar to Stephen Morton moving up to the 400 for the first time, Liam Fedus moved up to the 800 for the first time. While Fedus did not move into the top-10 list, he did win the event despite getting boxed in and using far too much energy to get out of it. Running 28 for the first 200, the leaders came though the 400 split in 58. With Fedus on the rail behind two of his teammates, he decided diplomacy was not going to get him anywhere. Fedus yelled to his teammates to let him through but they did not know who was yelling at them. Fedus then shoved his way though and took control of the race. Coming into the homestretch the wind started taking its toll on Fedus but he held on for a fine 1:56.11 debut.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, the Engineers travel to the Coast Guard Academy for the defense of the NEWMAC Conference Championship. MIT, Springfield and Coast Guard will be pretty even on paper entering the meet.
