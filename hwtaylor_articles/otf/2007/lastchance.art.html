  <p align="left">May 18, 2007</p>
  <p align="left">Over 20 colleges from the New England and surrounding area competed in the NCAA approved <a href="lastchance.res.html">Last Chance Qualifier</a> hosted by MIT on this, the final day to attain a nationally qualifying mark for the NCAA Division III Championships. Despite the non-spring like weather, quite a few individuals were able to reach that standard and move on to the Championship being held next week at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.</p>
  <p align="left">For the MIT men's team, only Omari Stephens was able to crack the qualifying list with an improved mark. Stephens improved his personal best for the second week in succession, clearing 15-7 1/4 to place him third all time among MIT pole vaulters. Stephen's winning vault put him in a possible position to be selected for the championship field, which will be determined on Sunday.</p>
  <p align="left">Yermie Cohen won the 1500 with an excellently executed come from behind victory, but the wind and rain derailed the opportunity for a fast time. Cohen's 3:59.00 was an excellent performance given the conditions.</p>
  <p align="left">Three MIT men's track and field members have provisionally qualified for the NCAA Division III Championship; Eric Khatchadourian in the 10,000 (31:08. 23), Stephen Morton in the triple jump (46-04) and Omari Stephens (15-07 1/4).</p>
  <p align="left">While the chances of the MIT men's team qualifying an athlete for the championships seems slim, it would only be the second outdoor NCAA championship in the past 25 years that an MIT men's track and field athlete has not made the elite field. Regardless, the team has had an amazingly successful season, again finishing undefeated and winning their seventh consecutive conference championship. The freshmen led the way in scoring by more than double any other class. With only five seniors graduating the team and MIT this year, the future looks very bright for the Engineers.</p>
