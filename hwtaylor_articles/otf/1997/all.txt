    TO REMAIN UNDEFEATED  
    
    **
    
    
    
     The Men's Track Team traveled to Waterville, Maine
    this past weekend to face and defeat host Colby College, Bowdoin
    College, Bates College, and the University of Southern Maine by
    scores of 93 1/2 to 83, 63, 50, and 6 1/2 respectively.  MIT competed
    without many of their top athletes.  Some of these were due to
    injuries (Ravi Sastry, Matt Sandholm, Omar Saleh, and Mike DeMassa),
    and others were due to absences (George Torres, Jason Dailey,
    and Juan Carlos Fuenmayor-Soto)  Perhaps the key absence was Dafe
    Ogagan missing the meet due to academics.  Coach Halston Taylor
    estimates the team gave up 36 points which would have also taken
    away 36 points from the opposition.  Scoring in the meet went
    6-4-3-2-1.
    
    
    
     The weather started out looking very promising,
    but soon turned cold and windy, affecting many of the performances
    of the day.  Nevertheless, numerous personal bests were established
    by MIT.  Qualifying for the New England Division III Championships
    in 4 weeks were Morio Alexander 'G in the Triple Jump (45-0),
    Andrew Jamieson '99 in the Pole Vault (13-0), and Lincoln Bonner
    '97 in the Long Jump (20-11 1/2), all winning their respective
    events.
    
    
    
     MIT scored 0 points in the throwing events.  In
    part, the blame should be placed on the three throwers who missed
    the bus, but the quality of the opposing team's throwers may have
    negated their effect anyway.  Possibilities existed for Tech in
    the Javelin and the Discus, but it did not materialize.
    
    
    
     In addition to the jumps already mentioned, Morio
    also placed 3rd in the Long Jump with 20-06 1/2.  Jared Miller
    '98 place 5th in the Triple Jump with 39-11 1/2.  Leif Seed '99
    just missed scoring in the Triple Jump, but added a tie for 4th
    in the High Jump at 5-10.  In the Pole Vault, Sam Thibault '00
    vaulted 12-6 for 3rd and Matt Potts '00 came in 4th at 12-0.
    
    
    
     Fortunately, the runners were able to establish
    some dominance in the distance events.  Leif won the Steeple once
    again in 9:33.21 and was followed in 2nd by Mike Parkins '99 in
    9:35.92.  Both ran casually until there was 800 meters to go.
    
    
    
     In the 1500, the next event, Chris McGuire '00 continued
    his undefeated season in this race with a slow-paced, strategic
    4:12.29.  Coming close behind in 3rd with a personal best was
    Sohail Husain '98 (4:14.28), and Joel Ford in 4th (4:14.53).
    
    
    
     By the time the meet got around to the 5000, Tech
    just needed to make certain that no one from Colby or Bowdoin
    beat them.  A fatigued Parkins and McGuire did what was necessary,
    placing 2nd and 3rd in 15:57.74 and 15:58.32.  Running a personal
    best, just out of placing, was Frank Johnston '00 in 16:11.10.
    
    
    
     The shorter events did not go very well for Tech
    for the most part.  In the 100, Matt Sandholm thought he was ready
    to go, but 30 meters into the race, the same hamstring injury
    that caused him to sit our the New England Division III Championships,
    recurred.  Brad Geilfuss 'G hung on for 3rd and Alim Needham '97
    came through for 5th place.
    
    
    
     In the 200 Meters, knowing they would not have Sandholm,
    Neal Karchem '99 and Geilfuss teamed up to get 4th and 5th in
    23.72 and 23.79.
    
    
    
    Karchem did much better in the 400, placing 2nd with
    a season best 51.50.  John Kim '98 ran 53.22 to follow in 4th.
     The wind was having it's effect in these races.
    
    
    
     The 800 Meters definitely did not go as planned.
     MIT was planning on sweeping 1,2,3 in the race, but ended up
    getting 3,4,5.  Running out front, but not doing anything with
    it, or falling too far behind were MIT's errors.  Tech's top two
    runners, Ford (3rd) and Edgar Ngwenya 'G (5th), were still feeling
    the effects of being sick during the week, while Martin Suresh
    '99 (4th), simply lost focus and fell too far behind at the beginning.
    
    
    
     The hurdle races went better, but not great.  Lincoln
    had a great day, as he added to 110HH victory to his Long Jump
    with a 15.75 effort.  Dave Ratliff ran a personal best of 17.86,
    but did not place.  Missing Ogagan and Sastry really hurt in this
    race.  The 400IH proved too much for Bonner.  Looking good until
    hitting the 6th hurdle, Lincoln totally fell apart and finished
    out of the money in 11th.  Leif ran a best (58.50), but not good
    enough, as Colby went 1-2.
    
    
    
     Next week, Tech hosts Tufts University on Saturday
    at 1:00.  Last year, Tufts was the only team to defeat MIT.  
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **DISAPPOINTING FINALE FOR MEN'S TRACK  
    
    **
    
    
    
     MIT Men's Track Team sent three runners to this
    year's NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships; two 3000 Meter
    Steeplechasers (Mike Parkins '99 and Leif Seed '99), and one 5000
    Meter runner (Chris McGuire '00).  Leif and Mike were seeded 7th
    and 8th respectively while Chris was seeded 7th in the 5K.
    
    
    
     For each of the Tech runners it was their first
    time qualifying for Nationals.  On Wednesday, the trials for the
    Steeplechase were held.  Parkins was in the first heat and quickly
    moved his way to the lead pack as they went out very fast in 66
    seconds for the first quarter.  Knowing the qualifying procedure
    was to take the first four finishers in each of the two heats
    and the next four fastest times to Friday's final, Mike was content
    to let the others do the work.  The fast pace quickly separated
    the field and left Mike and one other runner out by themselves.
     The rest of the race was fairly uneventful as the pace slowed
    and Mike finished in second with a 9:17 performance.
    
    
    
     Leif had been injured with a tendonitis for over
    three weeks and had only done pool work and two light workouts
    in that time.  He raced two weeks earlier in the New England Division
    III Championships and faded badly after the mile mark.  Still
    in good shape, but lacking the confidence without doing the track
    work, Leif nevertheless attempted to qualify.  Mike's heat had
    been so slow that all Leif needed to do was run 9:26 and place
    no worse than 7th out of a possible 9 and he would be in the finals.
    
    
    
     The race began at a good but comfortable pace for
    Leif as he settled in behind the leaders.  After three laps the
    group split and Leif along with three others were in front. This
    continued through five laps with Leif coming through the mile
    in 4:50.  However, with 800 meters to go, Leif could not deal
    with the pain from the injury or his confidence and faded badly.
     He finished the race, which was no small feat, and needed assistance
    walking for the remaining two days of the Championship.  He did
    not qualify for the final and even if he had would not have been
    able to run it.
    
    
    
     The next day was the Freshman 5000 Meter Record
    Holder's turn.  Chris was seeded to run the first heat of two.
     Six of the 18 entrants for the 5K had run the 10K the night before.
     Three of those, including the winner, was in Chris's heat.  The
    winner from Mount Union College took the lead and kept the pace
    incredibly slow (5:06 for the first mile).  No one seemed interested
    in passing him and Chris was comfortable where he was and confident
    in his kick.
    
    
    
     Then trouble came.  Chris has had the unfortunate
    bad habits of running right on the rail and not moving up in races
    soon enough.  Remembering to stay out during the first mile, Chris
    then lost focus and found himself boxed-in on the rail and getting
    beat on quite a bit by his competitors.  For nearly a mile and
    a half Chris tried to get out but only received more pushing and
    shoving as a result.  The pace quickened to a 4:50 second mile,
    which was still slow, and then with 800 meters to go, the leaders
    jumped the pace to about 66 seconds.  Chris tried to go, but feeling
    the beating he had taken and the energy depleted from trying to
    get out of the box he was in, could not respond.  He finished
    in 7th with a 15:20 time, but that was not going to be good enough
    to get him in to the finals.  The second heat went out much faster
    and qualified all but two of their heat.
    
    
    
     In the finals of the Steeplechase on Friday, Mike
    was hoping for a fast start to separate the pack.  Coach Taylor
    knew that the two times Mike had difficulty finishing strong in
    races had been when the pace went out hard, and knew it would
    be a risk for Mike.  At the same time, Mike was ready for a breakthrough
    race and going out hard was the only way to make that happen.
     
    
    
    
     The pace did go out hard and as predicted the pack
    separated immediately.  There were four runners in the lead pack
    and Mike was one of them.  The gap between the first and second
    pack grew to about 30 meters with 1000 meters to go.  Mike came
    through the 2000 mark two seconds faster than he had in the trials
    (6:04) and looked good.  At 2400 meters, Mike came through in
    7:20, which was three seconds faster than his trials run, but
    had the "survival look" on his face, and the pursuit
    group was beginning to move.  Mike then fatigued badly with a
    79 second lap and faded to 6th by the 2800 mark.  With 200 meters
    to go Mike could not muster a kick as three more passed him with
    50 meters to go.  He finished in ninth, one place out of All-America.
    
    
    
     Although the performances were not what the team
    hoped for, the experience of being at Nationals and knowing what
    to expect next time was invaluable.  With such a young group of
    distance runners the future looks bright for the Engineers.
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **MEN'S TRACK PLACES 3RD IN NE DIV. 3 CHAMPIONSHIPS  
    
    **
    
    
    
     This past Saturday, the Men's Track Team visited
    Tufts for the New England Division III Championships.  MIT, seeded
    3rd behind Williams College, and Springfield College, finished
    where expected, 1 1/2 points ahead of Wheaton College.
    
    
    
     MIT began the day behind because of the Decathlon
    results from Thursday and Friday.  Williams scored 10 for first
    place and Springfield garnered 6 for 3rd in that event.  Bowdoin
    College was leading with 12 points after finishing 2nd and 4th,
    but they did not have enough top entries to break into the top
    3 teams.
    
    
    
     The trials began well for Tech.  In the High Hurdles,
    both Lincoln Bonner '97 and Ravi Sastry '98 advanced to the finals
    after placing 1st and 3rd in their heat.  Matt Sandholm '97, having
    not run the 100 since March 29th due to a pulled hamstring, was
    just hoping to finish the race.  However, he to qualified for
    the finals by finishing 3rd in his heat of the 100 Meters.  The
    only other trial that Tech runners were entered in was the 400
    Meters.  Neal Karchem '99, seeded 8th in the race, came from behind
    in the home stretch to place 4th and advance to the finals with
    a season best of 51.01.
    
    
    
     The first final was the Long Jump.  Although Tech
    had four qualifiers in the event, only Dafe Ogagan '97 was seeded
    to place.  The jumping was not going well for anyone, including
    MIT.  Bonner and Sastry were in the first flight which conflicted
    with the High Hurdle Trials.  Ravi did not make the finals, but
    Bonner did.  In the 2nd flight, Morio Alexander 'G fouled his
    first two jumps, either of which would have probably have gotten
    him a 2nd place.  On his final attempt he qualified for the finals
    and was sitting in 5th place.  Dafe qualified on his first jump
    and was in 6th place with his 20-06 1/2 effort.  In the finals
    nothing changed as far as place was concerned, but Dafe landed
    poorly, tearing his cartilage in his knee, and ending his season
    
    
    
     Next were the High Jump and Pole Vault.  Ravi was
    entered in the High Jump, but failed to make the starting height.
     Dafe was seeded 2nd in the Pole Vault and many thought he had
    a chance to win and qualify for the NCAA Championships.  Without
    him the other four Tech vaulters who had qualified for the event,
    but were not seeded to score, needed to step up.  Andrew Jamieson
    '99, accepted the challenge and finished 2nd with a vault of 13-09,
    his best of the season.  Other Tech vaulters in the event were
    Sam Thibault '00 (12-09), Mike DeMassa '97 (12-03), and Matt Potts
    '00 (12-03).
    
    
    
     The 400 Relay was the first final in the running
    events during the  afternoon schedule.  MIT was seeded 6th, but
    that was with either Sandholm or Ogagan anchoring the team, neither
    of which was able to run.  John Kim '98, the designated alternate,
    filled in nicely, taking the baton from Karchem in a great exchange
    and brought it home in 6th place for 1 point.  Brad Geilfuss 'G,
    and Bonner '97 were the first two legs of the relay and put MIT
    in great position early.
    
    
    
     The premier event for Tech was to be the 3000 Meter
    Steeplechase.  Leif Seed '99 and Mike Parkins '99, both having
    qualified for Nationals in the event, were seeded 1 and 2 respectively.
     Leif had been injured for a week and a half, and entered the
    race doubting his ability to race well.  His lack of confidence
    showed when after the mile mark he began to fade.  Parkins ran
    on by himself, winning easily in 9:21.84, despite hitting the
    last water jump and going head first into the pit.  Leif faded
    badly, but held onto 5th with a time of 9:37.15.
    
    
    
     Next up was the 110HH.  Bonner seeded 1st, was hoping
    to complete his undefeated season.  Lincoln had an unusually good
    start, but had trouble on the 3rd and 4th hurdles.  He fell behind,
    caught up a little late in the race, but finished 2nd in 15.51.
     Sastry, running the event for the 1st time since Spring Break
    because of injury, finished 5th in 15.93.
    
    
    
     Karchem scored in the 400 as a freshman after being
    seeded out of the top 10.  This year he hoped to do the same,
    however the field pulled away at the start.  Neal came back on
    the homestretch, but could not make up the difference and finished
    8th with a 51.07.
    
    
    
     Sandholm finished the trials, but could he finish
    the finals.  Everyone member of the MIT Team hoped Matt would
    finish and fare well, but few thought he would.  Running fast
    for the first time in nearly 2 months, Matt could not get in the
    groove, but he did finish and placed 5th in 11.10 for 2 big unexpected
    points.
    
    
    
     MIT had two entries in the 800, and both Edgar Ngwenya
    'G, and Joel Ford '98 were in the fast section, seeded 7th and
    8th.  The first section went out hard and finished in 1:56.  Being
    aware of the times from the first section, the 2nd section went
    out hard in 54 seconds for the 400 split.  Ford stayed with the
    group until the homestretch where he faded a bit, but held on
    for 6th place in a personal best of 1:55.44.  Ngwenya, injured
    for the past month with a sore hip flexor, could not hold onto
    the fast pace and faded badly in the last lap.
    
    
    
     Going back to the field events, Alexander was trying
    to find the take-off board in the Triple Jump.  Morio had foul
    problems, but got in a legal jump to put in 4th going into the
    finals.  Morio finally got a decent leap in on his final attempt
    and moved up to 2nd with a 44-02 1/2 effort.  Sam Thibault, also
    in the event, could not get approach down and fouled out of the
    event.
    
    
    
     With two event to go, MIT was in 5th place.  Chris
    McGuire '00 was seeded 7th in the 5000 Meters, but he and Coach
    Taylor knew he was capable of much more.  Chris planned on holding
    onto the pack, regardless of pace until he felt confident he could
    outkick them.  He planned the race and raced the plan.  Coming
    through average mile splits of 4:43, 9:35, and 14:19, Chris blasted
    past the leaders with 600 meters to go and won going away with
    a national qualifying performance of 14:50.26.  Chris covered
    the final 600 meters in 1:35 in route to setting a new freshman
    record.  
    
    
    
     All MIT had to do to finish in 3rd place was not
    let Wheaton or Tufts beat them by any more than 7 1/2 points in
    the 1600 Meter Relay.  Wheaton College had qualified for Nationals
    in this relay Indoors, but thus far had failed to do so Outdoors.
     Running up front until the final leg, Wheaton got passed by Williams
    coming into the home stretch and finished 2nd.  MIT only needed
    to place 6th to secure 3rd place.  Bonner led off with a conservative
    leg in 52.3.  Martin Suresh '99 was too competitive in the first
    200 meters, fatiguing in the home stretch, and finishing with
    a 52.2 split.  Dan Helgesen '97 ran a superb leg of 51.0 after
    a poor baton exchange, passing two teams and putting Tech into
    the thick of the race.  Karchem ran his best anchor leg of the
    season when he needed to.  He finished with a 50.2 split and brought
    the baton home in 5th place, securing the 3rd place trophy.
    
    
    
     Next week are the All New England Championships
    at Northeastern University.  Entered in that meet are Alexander
    in the Long and Triple Jumps, Ford in the 800 Meters, Bonner in
    the High Hurdles, McGuire in the 5000, and Seed and Parkins in
    the Steeplechase.  Others have qualified, but have decided to
    let their injuries heal and get ready for final exams. 
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **MEN'S TRACK FARES WELL AT ALL NEW ENGLAND
    CHAMPIONSHIPS  
    
    **
    
    
    
     Due to exams and stiff standards, MIT Men's Track
    Team only had 4 entries in this weekend's NEIAAA Championships.
     This is the only meet in the season where all NCAA Divisions
    go head to head in a championship.  The format is a two day meet
    with trials taking place on Friday and finals on Saturday except
    for a few of the field events and the 5 and 10K.
    
    
    
     Dafe Ogagan '97, and Andrew Jamieson '99 qualified
    in the Pole Vault, but Dafe tore some cartilage in his knee last
    week and Andrew wanted to prepare for exams.  Likewise, Leif Seed,
    bothered by a tendonitis in his lower leg, did not run in hopes
    that he will be able to race better at Nationals.  Entered athletes
    who did not make the fields were Morio Alexander 'G, in the Triple
    Jump with a 45-00 mark, and Joel Ford '98, in the 800 with a 1:55.44
    time.
    
    
    
     Those who did make it in were Lincoln Bonner '97
    in the 110HH, freshman Chris McGuire in the 5000, and Mike Parkins
    in the 3000 Steeplechase.
    
    
    
     On Friday, Lincoln, seeded 12th, ran the trials
    and turned in a time of 15.45 to qualify for Saturday's Final.
     Also on Friday was the 5000.  The fast and slow sections were
    combined and run at an earlier than usual time.  Neither Coach
    Taylor nor Chris McGuire noticed the change printed on the seed
    sheets.  Hearing over the loudspeaker, 20 minutes before the event
    that it had been moved up, Chris immediately began his warmup.
     
    
    
    
     Chris warmup up okay and appeared ready to go, but
    with 1 mile to go his stomach began to cramp from a late snack
    and probably due to the rushed warmup.  He nevertheless ran his
    second best time of the season with a 14:57.53, but was not his
    usual self at the finish.
    
    
    
     On Saturday, Lincoln competed in the Finals.  He
    had a pretty good start, but was off balance after the 2nd, and
    3rd hurdles.  A slow trail leg was his problem on this his final
    110HH race for MIT.  Lincoln placed 6th and scored with a time
    of 15.47.
    
    
    
     Last up for MIT was Parkins.  Mike was seeded 4th,
    but with Seed out of the field, he moved up to 3rd seed.  The
    race was a perfect pace for Mike, but later in the race he was
    sloppy over a couple of water jumps, nearly stopping on the last
    one.  He had taken the lead with 500 meters to go and held it
    until the last 200.  The last water jump was the difference as
    he lost by a little over 1 second, but finished 2nd in 9:12.78.
    
    
    
     Going into this week's National Championships, Seed
    and Parkins are seeded 7th and 8th respectively in the 3000 Meter
    Steeplechase.  McGuire is seeded 7th in the 5000 Meters.  The
    Steeplechase is contested on Wednesday and Friday and the 5000
    on Thursday and Saturday. 
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **TRACK TEAM OPENS SEASON WELL AT**
    
    
    
    **UCSD SPRING BREAK INVITE  
    
    **
    
    
    
    The Men's Track Team finished a week of warm weather
    in sunny San Diego with outstanding performances at the UCSD Spring
    Break Invite. The meet was non-scoring, and had 1700 athletes
    from all over the country including many club and Olympic athletes.
    
    
    
    The order of events was definitely abnormal, but
    advantageous to doubling or tripling for many of the runners.
    The Steeplechase was the first running event of the day and did
    not disappoint. Leif Seed '99 ran with the leaders, which included
    an Olympian from Japan, for most of the race. Leif finished strongly
    as the 1st collegian in 9:12.68. This time qualified him for the
    NCAA Championships in late May. Also in the race was Mike Parkins
    '99. Mike ran 3 seconds off his best performance with a 9:31.56.
    
    
    
    Next up was the Shot Put. Patrick Dannen '98 started
    things off with a 41-11 1/2 effort. Following Patrick was George
    Torres '99. George had some difficulties, but still managed a
    38-00 1/4 throw. George was entered in all four of the throwing
    events, thus stood around or competed for about 8 hours.
    
    
    
    The duration of these invitationals is the primary
    reason the MIT Men's Team does not do more of them. Coach Taylor
    believes it requires too much of the student/athlete's time. Also,
    invitationals are not scored, which changes the emphasis of the
    competition. 
    
    
    
    Continuing with the odd schedule, Chris McGuire '00
    was up next in the 5000. At this time the temperature was nearing
    80 degrees and Chris was not accustomed to it. He lost focus in
    the middle of the race and did not regain his competitiveness
    until there were 3 laps to go. Nevertheless, Chris qualified for
    the New England Division III Championship with a 15:30.96 time.
    
    
    
    Next up was the 800 Meters. The sections were arranged
    from slowest to fastest. In the case of the 800 there were 7 sections.
    Martin Suresh '99, was in the 3rd section. Martin went out very
    intelligently in 58 seconds for the first lap, and looked in position
    to win his section. However, he faded a little at the end, but
    still finished with a personal best of 2:01.26. Edgar Ngwenya
    'G, was in the 6th section. Edgar came within the last straight
    of winning. After a fine 55.7 first quarter, Edgar finished with
    a personal best of 1:56.75. Joel Ford '98, was in the final section
    and also made a bid for the victory. Joel also fell a little short,
    tying up in the last 100 meters to finish in 1:56.96, a personal
    record. Both Edgar and Joel qualified for the New England Division
    III Championships.
    
    
    
    About this time the Pole Vault was getting underway.
    Both Dafe Ogagan '97 and Andrew Jamieson '99 were entered with
    the same qualifying mark of 14-06. Andrew did not have the best
    of days, no-heighting at his entering height of 13-1. Dafe had
    some close moments early, but eventually cleared 14-09 to match
    last year's best. Dafe won the Open Pole Vault with that effort.
    
    
    
    MIT's only entrant in the 100 Meters was Matt Sandholm
    '97. Matt had an understandably poor start, due to his time off
    from injury, but still managed a Division III qualifying mark
    of 11.03. Matt won his section with that time.
    
    
    
    In the Long Jump injuries prevailed. Morio Alexander
    'G, jumped 20-09 1/4, but was inhibited from really pushing it
    because of an injury to his ankle. Ravi Sastry '98, did not jump
    because of poor timing and a scheduling conflict with the 400IH.
    Lincoln Bonner '97, nursing a bad ankle, only managed 18-11 1/2.
    Jared Miller '98, jumped okay with a 19-05 effort.
    
    
    
    The previously mentioned 400IH were next and neither
    Lincoln nor Ravi were able to run faster than 60 seconds. Both
    were running well through 6 hurdles, but seemed to lack what was
    necessary to bring it home in a fast time. Lincoln ran 60.89 and
    Ravi 61.06.
    
    
    
    MIT's only entry in the High Jump was Sastry. Not
    100%, and having not spent much time working on his high jumping
    recently, led to a sub par jump of only 5-10.
    
    
    
    The Discus and Hammer were held at approximately
    the same time. Torres, entered in both had to do some hustling
    to accomplish both. In the Hammer, George threw a personal best
    of 140-10 and narrowly miss qualifying or the Division III Championship.
    In the Discus, he threw 123-11 for a satisfying season opener.
    Also in the Discus was Dannen, who threw 118-09. A couple of Dannen's
    fouls were probably near 130.
    
    
    
    MIT had a pretty good line-up in the 400 Meter Relay
    with Sandholm, Bonner, Neal Karchem '99, and Ogagan. The first
    three legs looked really good, but Dafe felt a little tightness
    in his hamstring and eased up after the first 10 meters. MIT still
    won, but only ran 44.18. A sub 43 is definitely in the future
    if the team can get healthy.
    
    
    
    MIT had four entries in the 400 Meters. Alexander
    and Ngwenya were in the 1st section of 7. Edgar went out hard
    and stayed in front until the finish, running a 53.47. Morio finished
    in an unusually slow 54.00, perhaps still feeling the effects
    of his jumps. John Kim '98, was in the 2nd section. John did not
    have a good race and finished in 54.76. Karchem was in the 4th
    section and although he did not meet his goal he did run a respectable
    52.71.
    
    
    
    The 110 High Hurdles had Bonner, Ogagan, and Sastry
    entered from MIT. Lincoln had a good start, but got off balance
    over a couple of hurdles. He still managed a personal best of
    15.72, which qualified him for the Division III Championships.
    Ravi injured his quadriceps shortly into the race, but still tied
    his personal best of 15.80. Dafe, having not told his coach about
    the degree of soreness in his hamstring, ran the hurdles in 16.54.
    
    
    
    The 1500 was next, and all of Tech's distance and
    middle-distance runners were doubling back from the morning's
    efforts. Again the sections were arranged from slowest to fastest.
    The first of four sections had Sohail Husain '98 and Suresh. Sohail
    took the lead during the final lap and looked to be on his way
    to victory. However, going into the final 200 meters the light
    in Sohail's furnace went out as he finished in a respectable 4:18.07.
    Martin, running the 1500 for the first time at MIT, really did
    not know the pace of the race. Martin finished in 4:26.19, but
    will do better if he runs this race again. The 3rd section had
    Ford, Parkins, and McGuire entered from MIT. After a slow start
    Joel took the lead and came through phenomenal splits of 62, 2:06,
    and 3:12. Joel had a tendency to lose his form when he gets fatigued
    and this time was no exception. He finished with a 53 last 300
    for a 4:05.54, a good opener, but not what Joel wanted. Passing
    Joel in the home stretch was McGuire. Chris ran a great second
    half to post a personal best of 4:04.91. Close behind the other
    two was Parkins. Mike did not have McGuire's kick, but ran a personal
    best of 4:07.08. In the fast section was Leif Seed. It is very
    difficult in athletics to come back from a record breaking, national
    qualifying performance, and focus well enough to run another good
    race. Leif's only objective was to win and he followed that perfectly.
    The pace was slow, starting out in 63 and proceeding to a 2:11
    half split. The pace picked up a little in the 3rd lap to come
    through 1200 in 3:14. Leif then took the lead and ran a superb
    44 last 300 to pull ahead in another personal best of 3:58.37.
    
    
    
    Finishing up the long day was the 1600 Meter Relay.
    MIT entered two relays. Originally the 400 runners were going
    to challenge the 800 runners to a dual, but some injuries and
    overall fatigue prevented that from happening. In the 1st section,
    Alexander led off with a 53.0, much better than his open race.
    Morio handed off to Mike DeMassa. Mike had dislocated his elbow
    in the Pole Vault during run-throughs in the Indoor New England
    Division III Championships and was not ready for that competition
    here. Having not trained with the quarter-milers, DeMassa nevertheless
    gave it his all. Unfortunately Mike went out a little fast and
    had a tough time finishing, coming in 55.4. Parkins came back
    for the third leg and his third race with a fine 54.1 effort to
    finish in 3:34.95.
    
    
    
    In the 2nd section, the best team ran. Leading off
    was Karchem, who ran a superb leg of 51.8 out in lane 9 in a 3-turn
    stagger. Ngwenya was next, and he also ran much better than his
    open 400 with a 52.4 leg. Edgar handed off the Ford, who found
    what he did not have at the end of the 1500, speed. Joel ran a
    great 50.8 to put MIT in contention. Leif finished off his career
    day by anchoring with a 51.1 leg to bring the team in 4th with
    a 3:26.55 time.
    
    
    
    Tech's next meet will be on April 5 at 1:00 at home
    against RPI and WPI in the annual Engineer's Cup. 
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **MIT DOES WELL AT RAINSOAKED WILLIAMS INVITATIONAL  
    
    **
    
    
    
     With an extra week between the end of the regular
    season and the Championships, the Men's Track Team went to the
    Williams' Invitational.  The intent was to go to a non-scoring
    competitive meet with good weather conditions.  Reality was a
    rainy, wind swept, cold day. There was very little competition
    because the coaches were worried about injuries the week before
    the Division III Championships, and pulled many of their competitors
    from the competition.
    
    
    
     Nevertheless, MIT had many season and personal bests,
    showing that they are ready for the Championships.  Qualifying
    for next week's meet were Mike DeMassa '97 in the Pole Vault with
    a season best of 12-09, and Mike Parkins '99 in the 5000 Meter
    Run with a time of 15:05.4.  This was the first meet that Mike
    did not run the Steeplechase.
    
    
    
     Other bests were turned in by numerous competitors.
     In his first long jump of the season, Ravi Sastry '98 jumped
    20-0.  In the Pole Vault, Dafe Ogagan '97 had a personal best
    of 14-10 to win that event.  Dafe had three great attempts at
    15-04, but did not quite make it.  Also in the Pole Vault, contested
    inside due to the weather conditions, Andrew Jamieson '99 started
    getting back to his Indoor form with a vault of 13-03 for a season
    best.  Lincoln Bonner '97 put together a fine 400IH race in running
    a personal best of 58.3, which probably will qualify him for next
    week's Championships if he decides to run that event.  In the
    800, Martin Suresh '99 came in 2nd with a personal best of 1:59.1.
     Also with a personal best in that race was Chuck Van Buren '98
    with a 2:03.6.  Dan Helgesen '97, recovering from a month long
    bout with sickness, ran a season best with a 2:00.5 performance.
     Neal Karchem '99 and Ashley Clayborne '99 had season and personal
    bests respectively, running 51.1 and 54.6.  In addition to Parkins
    fine performance in the 5000, was David Kelman's season best of
    17:08.5.
    
    
    
     The New England Division III Championships begin
    on Thursday, May 9 at Tufts with the Decathlon.  Although MIT
    does not have any decathletes, they will be contenders for one
    of the three trophies given to the top 3 teams.  Without the full
    services of injured Matt Sandholm '97, and Ravi Sastry '98, Tech
    will have its work cut out for it.
    
    
    
    



        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **TRACK TEAM ENDURES INJURIES AND ABSENCES
        TO REMAIN UNDEFEATED  
        
        **
        
        
        
         The Men's Track Team traveled to Waterville, Maine
        this past weekend to face and defeat host Colby College, Bowdoin
        College, Bates College, and the University of Southern Maine by
        scores of 93 1/2 to 83, 63, 50, and 6 1/2 respectively.  MIT competed
        without many of their top athletes.  Some of these were due to
        injuries (Ravi Sastry, Matt Sandholm, Omar Saleh, and Mike DeMassa),
        and others were due to absences (George Torres, Jason Dailey,
        and Juan Carlos Fuenmayor-Soto)  Perhaps the key absence was Dafe
        Ogagan missing the meet due to academics.  Coach Halston Taylor
        estimates the team gave up 36 points which would have also taken
        away 36 points from the opposition.  Scoring in the meet went
        6-4-3-2-1.
        
        
        
         The weather started out looking very promising,
        but soon turned cold and windy, affecting many of the performances
        of the day.  Nevertheless, numerous personal bests were established
        by MIT.  Qualifying for the New England Division III Championships
        in 4 weeks were Morio Alexander 'G in the Triple Jump (45-0),
        Andrew Jamieson '99 in the Pole Vault (13-0), and Lincoln Bonner
        '97 in the Long Jump (20-11 1/2), all winning their respective
        events.
        
        
        
         MIT scored 0 points in the throwing events.  In
        part, the blame should be placed on the three throwers who missed
        the bus, but the quality of the opposing team's throwers may have
        negated their effect anyway.  Possibilities existed for Tech in
        the Javelin and the Discus, but it did not materialize.
        
        
        
         In addition to the jumps already mentioned, Morio
        also placed 3rd in the Long Jump with 20-06 1/2.  Jared Miller
        '98 place 5th in the Triple Jump with 39-11 1/2.  Leif Seed '99
        just missed scoring in the Triple Jump, but added a tie for 4th
        in the High Jump at 5-10.  In the Pole Vault, Sam Thibault '00
        vaulted 12-6 for 3rd and Matt Potts '00 came in 4th at 12-0.
        
        
        
         Fortunately, the runners were able to establish
        some dominance in the distance events.  Leif won the Steeple once
        again in 9:33.21 and was followed in 2nd by Mike Parkins '99 in
        9:35.92.  Both ran casually until there was 800 meters to go.
        
        
        
         In the 1500, the next event, Chris McGuire '00 continued
        his undefeated season in this race with a slow-paced, strategic
        4:12.29.  Coming close behind in 3rd with a personal best was
        Sohail Husain '98 (4:14.28), and Joel Ford in 4th (4:14.53).
        
        
        
         By the time the meet got around to the 5000, Tech
        just needed to make certain that no one from Colby or Bowdoin
        beat them.  A fatigued Parkins and McGuire did what was necessary,
        placing 2nd and 3rd in 15:57.74 and 15:58.32.  Running a personal
        best, just out of placing, was Frank Johnston '00 in 16:11.10.
        
        
        
         The shorter events did not go very well for Tech
        for the most part.  In the 100, Matt Sandholm thought he was ready
        to go, but 30 meters into the race, the same hamstring injury
        that caused him to sit our the New England Division III Championships,
        recurred.  Brad Geilfuss 'G hung on for 3rd and Alim Needham '97
        came through for 5th place.
        
        
        
         In the 200 Meters, knowing they would not have Sandholm,
        Neal Karchem '99 and Geilfuss teamed up to get 4th and 5th in
        23.72 and 23.79.
        
        
        
        Karchem did much better in the 400, placing 2nd with
        a season best 51.50.  John Kim '98 ran 53.22 to follow in 4th.
         The wind was having it's effect in these races.
        
        
        
         The 800 Meters definitely did not go as planned.
         MIT was planning on sweeping 1,2,3 in the race, but ended up
        getting 3,4,5.  Running out front, but not doing anything with
        it, or falling too far behind were MIT's errors.  Tech's top two
        runners, Ford (3rd) and Edgar Ngwenya 'G (5th), were still feeling
        the effects of being sick during the week, while Martin Suresh
        '99 (4th), simply lost focus and fell too far behind at the beginning.
        
        
        
         The hurdle races went better, but not great.  Lincoln
        had a great day, as he added to 110HH victory to his Long Jump
        with a 15.75 effort.  Dave Ratliff ran a personal best of 17.86,
        but did not place.  Missing Ogagan and Sastry really hurt in this
        race.  The 400IH proved too much for Bonner.  Looking good until
        hitting the 6th hurdle, Lincoln totally fell apart and finished
        out of the money in 11th.  Leif ran a best (58.50), but not good
        enough, as Colby went 1-2.
        
        
        
         Next week, Tech hosts Tufts University on Saturday
        at 1:00.  Last year, Tufts was the only team to defeat MIT.  
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **DISAPPOINTING FINALE FOR MEN'S TRACK  
        
        **
        
        
        
         MIT Men's Track Team sent three runners to this
        year's NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships; two 3000 Meter
        Steeplechasers (Mike Parkins '99 and Leif Seed '99), and one 5000
        Meter runner (Chris McGuire '00).  Leif and Mike were seeded 7th
        and 8th respectively while Chris was seeded 7th in the 5K.
        
        
        
         For each of the Tech runners it was their first
        time qualifying for Nationals.  On Wednesday, the trials for the
        Steeplechase were held.  Parkins was in the first heat and quickly
        moved his way to the lead pack as they went out very fast in 66
        seconds for the first quarter.  Knowing the qualifying procedure
        was to take the first four finishers in each of the two heats
        and the next four fastest times to Friday's final, Mike was content
        to let the others do the work.  The fast pace quickly separated
        the field and left Mike and one other runner out by themselves.
         The rest of the race was fairly uneventful as the pace slowed
        and Mike finished in second with a 9:17 performance.
        
        
        
         Leif had been injured with a tendonitis for over
        three weeks and had only done pool work and two light workouts
        in that time.  He raced two weeks earlier in the New England Division
        III Championships and faded badly after the mile mark.  Still
        in good shape, but lacking the confidence without doing the track
        work, Leif nevertheless attempted to qualify.  Mike's heat had
        been so slow that all Leif needed to do was run 9:26 and place
        no worse than 7th out of a possible 9 and he would be in the finals.
        
        
        
         The race began at a good but comfortable pace for
        Leif as he settled in behind the leaders.  After three laps the
        group split and Leif along with three others were in front. This
        continued through five laps with Leif coming through the mile
        in 4:50.  However, with 800 meters to go, Leif could not deal
        with the pain from the injury or his confidence and faded badly.
         He finished the race, which was no small feat, and needed assistance
        walking for the remaining two days of the Championship.  He did
        not qualify for the final and even if he had would not have been
        able to run it.
        
        
        
         The next day was the Freshman 5000 Meter Record
        Holder's turn.  Chris was seeded to run the first heat of two.
         Six of the 18 entrants for the 5K had run the 10K the night before.
         Three of those, including the winner, was in Chris's heat.  The
        winner from Mount Union College took the lead and kept the pace
        incredibly slow (5:06 for the first mile).  No one seemed interested
        in passing him and Chris was comfortable where he was and confident
        in his kick.
        
        
        
         Then trouble came.  Chris has had the unfortunate
        bad habits of running right on the rail and not moving up in races
        soon enough.  Remembering to stay out during the first mile, Chris
        then lost focus and found himself boxed-in on the rail and getting
        beat on quite a bit by his competitors.  For nearly a mile and
        a half Chris tried to get out but only received more pushing and
        shoving as a result.  The pace quickened to a 4:50 second mile,
        which was still slow, and then with 800 meters to go, the leaders
        jumped the pace to about 66 seconds.  Chris tried to go, but feeling
        the beating he had taken and the energy depleted from trying to
        get out of the box he was in, could not respond.  He finished
        in 7th with a 15:20 time, but that was not going to be good enough
        to get him in to the finals.  The second heat went out much faster
        and qualified all but two of their heat.
        
        
        
         In the finals of the Steeplechase on Friday, Mike
        was hoping for a fast start to separate the pack.  Coach Taylor
        knew that the two times Mike had difficulty finishing strong in
        races had been when the pace went out hard, and knew it would
        be a risk for Mike.  At the same time, Mike was ready for a breakthrough
        race and going out hard was the only way to make that happen.
         
        
        
        
         The pace did go out hard and as predicted the pack
        separated immediately.  There were four runners in the lead pack
        and Mike was one of them.  The gap between the first and second
        pack grew to about 30 meters with 1000 meters to go.  Mike came
        through the 2000 mark two seconds faster than he had in the trials
        (6:04) and looked good.  At 2400 meters, Mike came through in
        7:20, which was three seconds faster than his trials run, but
        had the "survival look" on his face, and the pursuit
        group was beginning to move.  Mike then fatigued badly with a
        79 second lap and faded to 6th by the 2800 mark.  With 200 meters
        to go Mike could not muster a kick as three more passed him with
        50 meters to go.  He finished in ninth, one place out of All-America.
        
        
        
         Although the performances were not what the team
        hoped for, the experience of being at Nationals and knowing what
        to expect next time was invaluable.  With such a young group of
        distance runners the future looks bright for the Engineers.
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **MEN'S TRACK PLACES 3RD IN NE DIV. 3 CHAMPIONSHIPS  
        
        **
        
        
        
         This past Saturday, the Men's Track Team visited
        Tufts for the New England Division III Championships.  MIT, seeded
        3rd behind Williams College, and Springfield College, finished
        where expected, 1 1/2 points ahead of Wheaton College.
        
        
        
         MIT began the day behind because of the Decathlon
        results from Thursday and Friday.  Williams scored 10 for first
        place and Springfield garnered 6 for 3rd in that event.  Bowdoin
        College was leading with 12 points after finishing 2nd and 4th,
        but they did not have enough top entries to break into the top
        3 teams.
        
        
        
         The trials began well for Tech.  In the High Hurdles,
        both Lincoln Bonner '97 and Ravi Sastry '98 advanced to the finals
        after placing 1st and 3rd in their heat.  Matt Sandholm '97, having
        not run the 100 since March 29th due to a pulled hamstring, was
        just hoping to finish the race.  However, he to qualified for
        the finals by finishing 3rd in his heat of the 100 Meters.  The
        only other trial that Tech runners were entered in was the 400
        Meters.  Neal Karchem '99, seeded 8th in the race, came from behind
        in the home stretch to place 4th and advance to the finals with
        a season best of 51.01.
        
        
        
         The first final was the Long Jump.  Although Tech
        had four qualifiers in the event, only Dafe Ogagan '97 was seeded
        to place.  The jumping was not going well for anyone, including
        MIT.  Bonner and Sastry were in the first flight which conflicted
        with the High Hurdle Trials.  Ravi did not make the finals, but
        Bonner did.  In the 2nd flight, Morio Alexander 'G fouled his
        first two jumps, either of which would have probably have gotten
        him a 2nd place.  On his final attempt he qualified for the finals
        and was sitting in 5th place.  Dafe qualified on his first jump
        and was in 6th place with his 20-06 1/2 effort.  In the finals
        nothing changed as far as place was concerned, but Dafe landed
        poorly, tearing his cartilage in his knee, and ending his season
        
        
        
         Next were the High Jump and Pole Vault.  Ravi was
        entered in the High Jump, but failed to make the starting height.
         Dafe was seeded 2nd in the Pole Vault and many thought he had
        a chance to win and qualify for the NCAA Championships.  Without
        him the other four Tech vaulters who had qualified for the event,
        but were not seeded to score, needed to step up.  Andrew Jamieson
        '99, accepted the challenge and finished 2nd with a vault of 13-09,
        his best of the season.  Other Tech vaulters in the event were
        Sam Thibault '00 (12-09), Mike DeMassa '97 (12-03), and Matt Potts
        '00 (12-03).
        
        
        
         The 400 Relay was the first final in the running
        events during the  afternoon schedule.  MIT was seeded 6th, but
        that was with either Sandholm or Ogagan anchoring the team, neither
        of which was able to run.  John Kim '98, the designated alternate,
        filled in nicely, taking the baton from Karchem in a great exchange
        and brought it home in 6th place for 1 point.  Brad Geilfuss 'G,
        and Bonner '97 were the first two legs of the relay and put MIT
        in great position early.
        
        
        
         The premier event for Tech was to be the 3000 Meter
        Steeplechase.  Leif Seed '99 and Mike Parkins '99, both having
        qualified for Nationals in the event, were seeded 1 and 2 respectively.
         Leif had been injured for a week and a half, and entered the
        race doubting his ability to race well.  His lack of confidence
        showed when after the mile mark he began to fade.  Parkins ran
        on by himself, winning easily in 9:21.84, despite hitting the
        last water jump and going head first into the pit.  Leif faded
        badly, but held onto 5th with a time of 9:37.15.
        
        
        
         Next up was the 110HH.  Bonner seeded 1st, was hoping
        to complete his undefeated season.  Lincoln had an unusually good
        start, but had trouble on the 3rd and 4th hurdles.  He fell behind,
        caught up a little late in the race, but finished 2nd in 15.51.
         Sastry, running the event for the 1st time since Spring Break
        because of injury, finished 5th in 15.93.
        
        
        
         Karchem scored in the 400 as a freshman after being
        seeded out of the top 10.  This year he hoped to do the same,
        however the field pulled away at the start.  Neal came back on
        the homestretch, but could not make up the difference and finished
        8th with a 51.07.
        
        
        
         Sandholm finished the trials, but could he finish
        the finals.  Everyone member of the MIT Team hoped Matt would
        finish and fare well, but few thought he would.  Running fast
        for the first time in nearly 2 months, Matt could not get in the
        groove, but he did finish and placed 5th in 11.10 for 2 big unexpected
        points.
        
        
        
         MIT had two entries in the 800, and both Edgar Ngwenya
        'G, and Joel Ford '98 were in the fast section, seeded 7th and
        8th.  The first section went out hard and finished in 1:56.  Being
        aware of the times from the first section, the 2nd section went
        out hard in 54 seconds for the 400 split.  Ford stayed with the
        group until the homestretch where he faded a bit, but held on
        for 6th place in a personal best of 1:55.44.  Ngwenya, injured
        for the past month with a sore hip flexor, could not hold onto
        the fast pace and faded badly in the last lap.
        
        
        
         Going back to the field events, Alexander was trying
        to find the take-off board in the Triple Jump.  Morio had foul
        problems, but got in a legal jump to put in 4th going into the
        finals.  Morio finally got a decent leap in on his final attempt
        and moved up to 2nd with a 44-02 1/2 effort.  Sam Thibault, also
        in the event, could not get approach down and fouled out of the
        event.
        
        
        
         With two event to go, MIT was in 5th place.  Chris
        McGuire '00 was seeded 7th in the 5000 Meters, but he and Coach
        Taylor knew he was capable of much more.  Chris planned on holding
        onto the pack, regardless of pace until he felt confident he could
        outkick them.  He planned the race and raced the plan.  Coming
        through average mile splits of 4:43, 9:35, and 14:19, Chris blasted
        past the leaders with 600 meters to go and won going away with
        a national qualifying performance of 14:50.26.  Chris covered
        the final 600 meters in 1:35 in route to setting a new freshman
        record.  
        
        
        
         All MIT had to do to finish in 3rd place was not
        let Wheaton or Tufts beat them by any more than 7 1/2 points in
        the 1600 Meter Relay.  Wheaton College had qualified for Nationals
        in this relay Indoors, but thus far had failed to do so Outdoors.
         Running up front until the final leg, Wheaton got passed by Williams
        coming into the home stretch and finished 2nd.  MIT only needed
        to place 6th to secure 3rd place.  Bonner led off with a conservative
        leg in 52.3.  Martin Suresh '99 was too competitive in the first
        200 meters, fatiguing in the home stretch, and finishing with
        a 52.2 split.  Dan Helgesen '97 ran a superb leg of 51.0 after
        a poor baton exchange, passing two teams and putting Tech into
        the thick of the race.  Karchem ran his best anchor leg of the
        season when he needed to.  He finished with a 50.2 split and brought
        the baton home in 5th place, securing the 3rd place trophy.
        
        
        
         Next week are the All New England Championships
        at Northeastern University.  Entered in that meet are Alexander
        in the Long and Triple Jumps, Ford in the 800 Meters, Bonner in
        the High Hurdles, McGuire in the 5000, and Seed and Parkins in
        the Steeplechase.  Others have qualified, but have decided to
        let their injuries heal and get ready for final exams. 
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **MEN'S TRACK FARES WELL AT ALL NEW ENGLAND
        CHAMPIONSHIPS  
        
        **
        
        
        
         Due to exams and stiff standards, MIT Men's Track
        Team only had 4 entries in this weekend's NEIAAA Championships.
         This is the only meet in the season where all NCAA Divisions
        go head to head in a championship.  The format is a two day meet
        with trials taking place on Friday and finals on Saturday except
        for a few of the field events and the 5 and 10K.
        
        
        
         Dafe Ogagan '97, and Andrew Jamieson '99 qualified
        in the Pole Vault, but Dafe tore some cartilage in his knee last
        week and Andrew wanted to prepare for exams.  Likewise, Leif Seed,
        bothered by a tendonitis in his lower leg, did not run in hopes
        that he will be able to race better at Nationals.  Entered athletes
        who did not make the fields were Morio Alexander 'G, in the Triple
        Jump with a 45-00 mark, and Joel Ford '98, in the 800 with a 1:55.44
        time.
        
        
        
         Those who did make it in were Lincoln Bonner '97
        in the 110HH, freshman Chris McGuire in the 5000, and Mike Parkins
        in the 3000 Steeplechase.
        
        
        
         On Friday, Lincoln, seeded 12th, ran the trials
        and turned in a time of 15.45 to qualify for Saturday's Final.
         Also on Friday was the 5000.  The fast and slow sections were
        combined and run at an earlier than usual time.  Neither Coach
        Taylor nor Chris McGuire noticed the change printed on the seed
        sheets.  Hearing over the loudspeaker, 20 minutes before the event
        that it had been moved up, Chris immediately began his warmup.
         
        
        
        
         Chris warmup up okay and appeared ready to go, but
        with 1 mile to go his stomach began to cramp from a late snack
        and probably due to the rushed warmup.  He nevertheless ran his
        second best time of the season with a 14:57.53, but was not his
        usual self at the finish.
        
        
        
         On Saturday, Lincoln competed in the Finals.  He
        had a pretty good start, but was off balance after the 2nd, and
        3rd hurdles.  A slow trail leg was his problem on this his final
        110HH race for MIT.  Lincoln placed 6th and scored with a time
        of 15.47.
        
        
        
         Last up for MIT was Parkins.  Mike was seeded 4th,
        but with Seed out of the field, he moved up to 3rd seed.  The
        race was a perfect pace for Mike, but later in the race he was
        sloppy over a couple of water jumps, nearly stopping on the last
        one.  He had taken the lead with 500 meters to go and held it
        until the last 200.  The last water jump was the difference as
        he lost by a little over 1 second, but finished 2nd in 9:12.78.
        
        
        
         Going into this week's National Championships, Seed
        and Parkins are seeded 7th and 8th respectively in the 3000 Meter
        Steeplechase.  McGuire is seeded 7th in the 5000 Meters.  The
        Steeplechase is contested on Wednesday and Friday and the 5000
        on Thursday and Saturday. 
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **TRACK TEAM OPENS SEASON WELL AT**
        
        
        
        **UCSD SPRING BREAK INVITE  
        
        **
        
        
        
        The Men's Track Team finished a week of warm weather
        in sunny San Diego with outstanding performances at the UCSD Spring
        Break Invite. The meet was non-scoring, and had 1700 athletes
        from all over the country including many club and Olympic athletes.
        
        
        
        The order of events was definitely abnormal, but
        advantageous to doubling or tripling for many of the runners.
        The Steeplechase was the first running event of the day and did
        not disappoint. Leif Seed '99 ran with the leaders, which included
        an Olympian from Japan, for most of the race. Leif finished strongly
        as the 1st collegian in 9:12.68. This time qualified him for the
        NCAA Championships in late May. Also in the race was Mike Parkins
        '99. Mike ran 3 seconds off his best performance with a 9:31.56.
        
        
        
        Next up was the Shot Put. Patrick Dannen '98 started
        things off with a 41-11 1/2 effort. Following Patrick was George
        Torres '99. George had some difficulties, but still managed a
        38-00 1/4 throw. George was entered in all four of the throwing
        events, thus stood around or competed for about 8 hours.
        
        
        
        The duration of these invitationals is the primary
        reason the MIT Men's Team does not do more of them. Coach Taylor
        believes it requires too much of the student/athlete's time. Also,
        invitationals are not scored, which changes the emphasis of the
        competition. 
        
        
        
        Continuing with the odd schedule, Chris McGuire '00
        was up next in the 5000. At this time the temperature was nearing
        80 degrees and Chris was not accustomed to it. He lost focus in
        the middle of the race and did not regain his competitiveness
        until there were 3 laps to go. Nevertheless, Chris qualified for
        the New England Division III Championship with a 15:30.96 time.
        
        
        
        Next up was the 800 Meters. The sections were arranged
        from slowest to fastest. In the case of the 800 there were 7 sections.
        Martin Suresh '99, was in the 3rd section. Martin went out very
        intelligently in 58 seconds for the first lap, and looked in position
        to win his section. However, he faded a little at the end, but
        still finished with a personal best of 2:01.26. Edgar Ngwenya
        'G, was in the 6th section. Edgar came within the last straight
        of winning. After a fine 55.7 first quarter, Edgar finished with
        a personal best of 1:56.75. Joel Ford '98, was in the final section
        and also made a bid for the victory. Joel also fell a little short,
        tying up in the last 100 meters to finish in 1:56.96, a personal
        record. Both Edgar and Joel qualified for the New England Division
        III Championships.
        
        
        
        About this time the Pole Vault was getting underway.
        Both Dafe Ogagan '97 and Andrew Jamieson '99 were entered with
        the same qualifying mark of 14-06. Andrew did not have the best
        of days, no-heighting at his entering height of 13-1. Dafe had
        some close moments early, but eventually cleared 14-09 to match
        last year's best. Dafe won the Open Pole Vault with that effort.
        
        
        
        MIT's only entrant in the 100 Meters was Matt Sandholm
        '97. Matt had an understandably poor start, due to his time off
        from injury, but still managed a Division III qualifying mark
        of 11.03. Matt won his section with that time.
        
        
        
        In the Long Jump injuries prevailed. Morio Alexander
        'G, jumped 20-09 1/4, but was inhibited from really pushing it
        because of an injury to his ankle. Ravi Sastry '98, did not jump
        because of poor timing and a scheduling conflict with the 400IH.
        Lincoln Bonner '97, nursing a bad ankle, only managed 18-11 1/2.
        Jared Miller '98, jumped okay with a 19-05 effort.
        
        
        
        The previously mentioned 400IH were next and neither
        Lincoln nor Ravi were able to run faster than 60 seconds. Both
        were running well through 6 hurdles, but seemed to lack what was
        necessary to bring it home in a fast time. Lincoln ran 60.89 and
        Ravi 61.06.
        
        
        
        MIT's only entry in the High Jump was Sastry. Not
        100%, and having not spent much time working on his high jumping
        recently, led to a sub par jump of only 5-10.
        
        
        
        The Discus and Hammer were held at approximately
        the same time. Torres, entered in both had to do some hustling
        to accomplish both. In the Hammer, George threw a personal best
        of 140-10 and narrowly miss qualifying or the Division III Championship.
        In the Discus, he threw 123-11 for a satisfying season opener.
        Also in the Discus was Dannen, who threw 118-09. A couple of Dannen's
        fouls were probably near 130.
        
        
        
        MIT had a pretty good line-up in the 400 Meter Relay
        with Sandholm, Bonner, Neal Karchem '99, and Ogagan. The first
        three legs looked really good, but Dafe felt a little tightness
        in his hamstring and eased up after the first 10 meters. MIT still
        won, but only ran 44.18. A sub 43 is definitely in the future
        if the team can get healthy.
        
        
        
        MIT had four entries in the 400 Meters. Alexander
        and Ngwenya were in the 1st section of 7. Edgar went out hard
        and stayed in front until the finish, running a 53.47. Morio finished
        in an unusually slow 54.00, perhaps still feeling the effects
        of his jumps. John Kim '98, was in the 2nd section. John did not
        have a good race and finished in 54.76. Karchem was in the 4th
        section and although he did not meet his goal he did run a respectable
        52.71.
        
        
        
        The 110 High Hurdles had Bonner, Ogagan, and Sastry
        entered from MIT. Lincoln had a good start, but got off balance
        over a couple of hurdles. He still managed a personal best of
        15.72, which qualified him for the Division III Championships.
        Ravi injured his quadriceps shortly into the race, but still tied
        his personal best of 15.80. Dafe, having not told his coach about
        the degree of soreness in his hamstring, ran the hurdles in 16.54.
        
        
        
        The 1500 was next, and all of Tech's distance and
        middle-distance runners were doubling back from the morning's
        efforts. Again the sections were arranged from slowest to fastest.
        The first of four sections had Sohail Husain '98 and Suresh. Sohail
        took the lead during the final lap and looked to be on his way
        to victory. However, going into the final 200 meters the light
        in Sohail's furnace went out as he finished in a respectable 4:18.07.
        Martin, running the 1500 for the first time at MIT, really did
        not know the pace of the race. Martin finished in 4:26.19, but
        will do better if he runs this race again. The 3rd section had
        Ford, Parkins, and McGuire entered from MIT. After a slow start
        Joel took the lead and came through phenomenal splits of 62, 2:06,
        and 3:12. Joel had a tendency to lose his form when he gets fatigued
        and this time was no exception. He finished with a 53 last 300
        for a 4:05.54, a good opener, but not what Joel wanted. Passing
        Joel in the home stretch was McGuire. Chris ran a great second
        half to post a personal best of 4:04.91. Close behind the other
        two was Parkins. Mike did not have McGuire's kick, but ran a personal
        best of 4:07.08. In the fast section was Leif Seed. It is very
        difficult in athletics to come back from a record breaking, national
        qualifying performance, and focus well enough to run another good
        race. Leif's only objective was to win and he followed that perfectly.
        The pace was slow, starting out in 63 and proceeding to a 2:11
        half split. The pace picked up a little in the 3rd lap to come
        through 1200 in 3:14. Leif then took the lead and ran a superb
        44 last 300 to pull ahead in another personal best of 3:58.37.
        
        
        
        Finishing up the long day was the 1600 Meter Relay.
        MIT entered two relays. Originally the 400 runners were going
        to challenge the 800 runners to a dual, but some injuries and
        overall fatigue prevented that from happening. In the 1st section,
        Alexander led off with a 53.0, much better than his open race.
        Morio handed off to Mike DeMassa. Mike had dislocated his elbow
        in the Pole Vault during run-throughs in the Indoor New England
        Division III Championships and was not ready for that competition
        here. Having not trained with the quarter-milers, DeMassa nevertheless
        gave it his all. Unfortunately Mike went out a little fast and
        had a tough time finishing, coming in 55.4. Parkins came back
        for the third leg and his third race with a fine 54.1 effort to
        finish in 3:34.95.
        
        
        
        In the 2nd section, the best team ran. Leading off
        was Karchem, who ran a superb leg of 51.8 out in lane 9 in a 3-turn
        stagger. Ngwenya was next, and he also ran much better than his
        open 400 with a 52.4 leg. Edgar handed off the Ford, who found
        what he did not have at the end of the 1500, speed. Joel ran a
        great 50.8 to put MIT in contention. Leif finished off his career
        day by anchoring with a 51.1 leg to bring the team in 4th with
        a 3:26.55 time.
        
        
        
        Tech's next meet will be on April 5 at 1:00 at home
        against RPI and WPI in the annual Engineer's Cup.
