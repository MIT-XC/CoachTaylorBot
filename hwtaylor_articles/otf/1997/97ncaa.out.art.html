</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> MIT Men's Track Team sent three runners to this
year's NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships; two 3000 Meter
Steeplechasers (Mike Parkins '99 and Leif Seed '99), and one 5000
Meter runner (Chris McGuire '00).  Leif and Mike were seeded 7th
and 8th respectively while Chris was seeded 7th in the 5K.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> For each of the Tech runners it was their first
time qualifying for Nationals.  On Wednesday, the trials for the
Steeplechase were held.  Parkins was in the first heat and quickly
moved his way to the lead pack as they went out very fast in 66
seconds for the first quarter.  Knowing the qualifying procedure
was to take the first four finishers in each of the two heats
and the next four fastest times to Friday's final, Mike was content
to let the others do the work.  The fast pace quickly separated
the field and left Mike and one other runner out by themselves.
 The rest of the race was fairly uneventful as the pace slowed
and Mike finished in second with a 9:17 performance.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Leif had been injured with a tendonitis for over
three weeks and had only done pool work and two light workouts
in that time.  He raced two weeks earlier in the New England Division
III Championships and faded badly after the mile mark.  Still
in good shape, but lacking the confidence without doing the track
work, Leif nevertheless attempted to qualify.  Mike's heat had
been so slow that all Leif needed to do was run 9:26 and place
no worse than 7th out of a possible 9 and he would be in the finals.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The race began at a good but comfortable pace for
Leif as he settled in behind the leaders.  After three laps the
group split and Leif along with three others were in front. This
continued through five laps with Leif coming through the mile
in 4:50.  However, with 800 meters to go, Leif could not deal
with the pain from the injury or his confidence and faded badly.
 He finished the race, which was no small feat, and needed assistance
walking for the remaining two days of the Championship.  He did
not qualify for the final and even if he had would not have been
able to run it.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The next day was the Freshman 5000 Meter Record
Holder's turn.  Chris was seeded to run the first heat of two.
 Six of the 18 entrants for the 5K had run the 10K the night before.
 Three of those, including the winner, was in Chris's heat.  The
winner from Mount Union College took the lead and kept the pace
incredibly slow (5:06 for the first mile).  No one seemed interested
in passing him and Chris was comfortable where he was and confident
in his kick.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Then trouble came.  Chris has had the unfortunate
bad habits of running right on the rail and not moving up in races
soon enough.  Remembering to stay out during the first mile, Chris
then lost focus and found himself boxed-in on the rail and getting
beat on quite a bit by his competitors.  For nearly a mile and
a half Chris tried to get out but only received more pushing and
shoving as a result.  The pace quickened to a 4:50 second mile,
which was still slow, and then with 800 meters to go, the leaders
jumped the pace to about 66 seconds.  Chris tried to go, but feeling
the beating he had taken and the energy depleted from trying to
get out of the box he was in, could not respond.  He finished
in 7th with a 15:20 time, but that was not going to be good enough
to get him in to the finals.  The second heat went out much faster
and qualified all but two of their heat.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> In the finals of the Steeplechase on Friday, Mike
was hoping for a fast start to separate the pack.  Coach Taylor
knew that the two times Mike had difficulty finishing strong in
races had been when the pace went out hard, and knew it would
be a risk for Mike.  At the same time, Mike was ready for a breakthrough
race and going out hard was the only way to make that happen.
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The pace did go out hard and as predicted the pack
separated immediately.  There were four runners in the lead pack
and Mike was one of them.  The gap between the first and second
pack grew to about 30 meters with 1000 meters to go.  Mike came
through the 2000 mark two seconds faster than he had in the trials
(6:04) and looked good.  At 2400 meters, Mike came through in
7:20, which was three seconds faster than his trials run, but
had the &quot;survival look&quot; on his face, and the pursuit
group was beginning to move.  Mike then fatigued badly with a
79 second lap and faded to 6th by the 2800 mark.  With 200 meters
to go Mike could not muster a kick as three more passed him with
50 meters to go.  He finished in ninth, one place out of All-America.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Although the performances were not what the team
hoped for, the experience of being at Nationals and knowing what
to expect next time was invaluable.  With such a young group of
distance runners the future looks bright for the Engineers.</FONT>
