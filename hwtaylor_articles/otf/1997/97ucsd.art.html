<FONT SIZE=4>The Men's Track Team finished a week of warm weather
in sunny San Diego with outstanding performances at the UCSD Spring
Break Invite. The meet was non-scoring, and had 1700 athletes
from all over the country including many club and Olympic athletes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The order of events was definitely abnormal, but
advantageous to doubling or tripling for many of the runners.
The Steeplechase was the first running event of the day and did
not disappoint. Leif Seed '99 ran with the leaders, which included
an Olympian from Japan, for most of the race. Leif finished strongly
as the 1st collegian in 9:12.68. This time qualified him for the
NCAA Championships in late May. Also in the race was Mike Parkins
'99. Mike ran 3 seconds off his best performance with a 9:31.56.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Next up was the Shot Put. Patrick Dannen '98 started
things off with a 41-11 1/2 effort. Following Patrick was George
Torres '99. George had some difficulties, but still managed a
38-00 1/4 throw. George was entered in all four of the throwing
events, thus stood around or competed for about 8 hours.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The duration of these invitationals is the primary
reason the MIT Men's Team does not do more of them. Coach Taylor
believes it requires too much of the student/athlete's time. Also,
invitationals are not scored, which changes the emphasis of the
competition. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Continuing with the odd schedule, Chris McGuire '00
was up next in the 5000. At this time the temperature was nearing
80 degrees and Chris was not accustomed to it. He lost focus in
the middle of the race and did not regain his competitiveness
until there were 3 laps to go. Nevertheless, Chris qualified for
the New England Division III Championship with a 15:30.96 time.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Next up was the 800 Meters. The sections were arranged
from slowest to fastest. In the case of the 800 there were 7 sections.
Martin Suresh '99, was in the 3rd section. Martin went out very
intelligently in 58 seconds for the first lap, and looked in position
to win his section. However, he faded a little at the end, but
still finished with a personal best of 2:01.26. Edgar Ngwenya
'G, was in the 6th section. Edgar came within the last straight
of winning. After a fine 55.7 first quarter, Edgar finished with
a personal best of 1:56.75. Joel Ford '98, was in the final section
and also made a bid for the victory. Joel also fell a little short,
tying up in the last 100 meters to finish in 1:56.96, a personal
record. Both Edgar and Joel qualified for the New England Division
III Championships.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>About this time the Pole Vault was getting underway.
Both Dafe Ogagan '97 and Andrew Jamieson '99 were entered with
the same qualifying mark of 14-06. Andrew did not have the best
of days, no-heighting at his entering height of 13-1. Dafe had
some close moments early, but eventually cleared 14-09 to match
last year's best. Dafe won the Open Pole Vault with that effort.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>MIT's only entrant in the 100 Meters was Matt Sandholm
'97. Matt had an understandably poor start, due to his time off
from injury, but still managed a Division III qualifying mark
of 11.03. Matt won his section with that time.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>In the Long Jump injuries prevailed. Morio Alexander
'G, jumped 20-09 1/4, but was inhibited from really pushing it
because of an injury to his ankle. Ravi Sastry '98, did not jump
because of poor timing and a scheduling conflict with the 400IH.
Lincoln Bonner '97, nursing a bad ankle, only managed 18-11 1/2.
Jared Miller '98, jumped okay with a 19-05 effort.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The previously mentioned 400IH were next and neither
Lincoln nor Ravi were able to run faster than 60 seconds. Both
were running well through 6 hurdles, but seemed to lack what was
necessary to bring it home in a fast time. Lincoln ran 60.89 and
Ravi 61.06.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>MIT's only entry in the High Jump was Sastry. Not
100%, and having not spent much time working on his high jumping
recently, led to a sub par jump of only 5-10.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The Discus and Hammer were held at approximately
the same time. Torres, entered in both had to do some hustling
to accomplish both. In the Hammer, George threw a personal best
of 140-10 and narrowly miss qualifying or the Division III Championship.
In the Discus, he threw 123-11 for a satisfying season opener.
Also in the Discus was Dannen, who threw 118-09. A couple of Dannen's
fouls were probably near 130.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>MIT had a pretty good line-up in the 400 Meter Relay
with Sandholm, Bonner, Neal Karchem '99, and Ogagan. The first
three legs looked really good, but Dafe felt a little tightness
in his hamstring and eased up after the first 10 meters. MIT still
won, but only ran 44.18. A sub 43 is definitely in the future
if the team can get healthy.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>MIT had four entries in the 400 Meters. Alexander
and Ngwenya were in the 1st section of 7. Edgar went out hard
and stayed in front until the finish, running a 53.47. Morio finished
in an unusually slow 54.00, perhaps still feeling the effects
of his jumps. John Kim '98, was in the 2nd section. John did not
have a good race and finished in 54.76. Karchem was in the 4th
section and although he did not meet his goal he did run a respectable
52.71.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The 110 High Hurdles had Bonner, Ogagan, and Sastry
entered from MIT. Lincoln had a good start, but got off balance
over a couple of hurdles. He still managed a personal best of
15.72, which qualified him for the Division III Championships.
Ravi injured his quadriceps shortly into the race, but still tied
his personal best of 15.80. Dafe, having not told his coach about
the degree of soreness in his hamstring, ran the hurdles in 16.54.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The 1500 was next, and all of Tech's distance and
middle-distance runners were doubling back from the morning's
efforts. Again the sections were arranged from slowest to fastest.
The first of four sections had Sohail Husain '98 and Suresh. Sohail
took the lead during the final lap and looked to be on his way
to victory. However, going into the final 200 meters the light
in Sohail's furnace went out as he finished in a respectable 4:18.07.
Martin, running the 1500 for the first time at MIT, really did
not know the pace of the race. Martin finished in 4:26.19, but
will do better if he runs this race again. The 3rd section had
Ford, Parkins, and McGuire entered from MIT. After a slow start
Joel took the lead and came through phenomenal splits of 62, 2:06,
and 3:12. Joel had a tendency to lose his form when he gets fatigued
and this time was no exception. He finished with a 53 last 300
for a 4:05.54, a good opener, but not what Joel wanted. Passing
Joel in the home stretch was McGuire. Chris ran a great second
half to post a personal best of 4:04.91. Close behind the other
two was Parkins. Mike did not have McGuire's kick, but ran a personal
best of 4:07.08. In the fast section was Leif Seed. It is very
difficult in athletics to come back from a record breaking, national
qualifying performance, and focus well enough to run another good
race. Leif's only objective was to win and he followed that perfectly.
The pace was slow, starting out in 63 and proceeding to a 2:11
half split. The pace picked up a little in the 3rd lap to come
through 1200 in 3:14. Leif then took the lead and ran a superb
44 last 300 to pull ahead in another personal best of 3:58.37.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Finishing up the long day was the 1600 Meter Relay.
MIT entered two relays. Originally the 400 runners were going
to challenge the 800 runners to a dual, but some injuries and
overall fatigue prevented that from happening. In the 1st section,
Alexander led off with a 53.0, much better than his open race.
Morio handed off to Mike DeMassa. Mike had dislocated his elbow
in the Pole Vault during run-throughs in the Indoor New England
Division III Championships and was not ready for that competition
here. Having not trained with the quarter-milers, DeMassa nevertheless
gave it his all. Unfortunately Mike went out a little fast and
had a tough time finishing, coming in 55.4. Parkins came back
for the third leg and his third race with a fine 54.1 effort to
finish in 3:34.95.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>In the 2nd section, the best team ran. Leading off
was Karchem, who ran a superb leg of 51.8 out in lane 9 in a 3-turn
stagger. Ngwenya was next, and he also ran much better than his
open 400 with a 52.4 leg. Edgar handed off the Ford, who found
what he did not have at the end of the 1500, speed. Joel ran a
great 50.8 to put MIT in contention. Leif finished off his career
day by anchoring with a 51.1 leg to bring the team in 4th with
a 3:26.55 time.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Tech's next meet will be on April 5 at 1:00 at home
against RPI and WPI in the annual Engineer's Cup. </FONT>
