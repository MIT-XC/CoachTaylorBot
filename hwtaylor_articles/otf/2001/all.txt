    April 14, 2001
    
    
    
    
    
    What was scheduled to be a four way meet between MIT, Bowdoin,
    Tufts and UMass/Lowell turned into a 6 way meet between MIT, Bowdoin,
    Bates, Colby, Tufts, and Southern Maine. MIT, getting accustomed to
    doing without key competitors Brian Hoying and Rick Rajter, benefited
    other stepping up their performances to lead the way to victory as
    Tech outscored their opponents by more than 100 points. MIT 253,
    Tufts 138, Bates 129.5, Bowdoin 107.5, Colby 55 and USM 38. The
    scoring went eight deep with a system of 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 for open
    events and 10-8-6-4-2-0 for the relays.
    
    
    
    
    
    Due to the large amounts of snow throughout most of the state of
    Maine, Colby College asked if they could move their meet to Bowdoin,
    bringing along Bates and USM. UMass/Lowell pulled out for unknown
    reasons. Bowdoin did a tremendous job of snow removal, which allowed
    everything but the jumps to be conducted outside, even if the banks
    of snow lining the track were three feet high.
    
    
    
    
    
    Right from the start things started going well for MIT. Craig
    Mielcarz led the way in the long jump with a 21-0 on his one and only
    jump, which aggravated his hamstring. Junius Ho and Victor Williamson
    added 6th and 7th places to give MIT the lead. At the same time, the
    javelin was being conducted from a makeshift approach off the track.
    MIT did not expect to do well in this event but Mark Jeunnette and
    Spiros Michalakis came through to garner 2nd and 3rd places with
    throws of 157-10 and 153-7 respectively. Dakus Gunn lended assistance
    with an 8th place throw.
    
    
    
    
    
    Shortly after, the 3000 Steeplechase started. The other teams put
    their top steeplers in the 1500 and MIT dominated with a 1-2-5
    finish. Craig Wildman led the way with a 10:01.4 followed by Phil
    Loiselle. Ian Bliss knocked more than 20 seconds from his time to
    finish 5th in 11.00.9.
    
    
    
    
    
    The hammer was also finishing about this time. While MIT did not
    dominate the event, they did place 4th and 5th despite the absence of
    Brian Wong. Chris Khan had a PR of 161-0 to just outdistance fellow
    freshman Marios Michalakis by less than 2 feet. Both are chasing the
    freshman record of 169-4.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 400 Relay team was not expected to place well, but Tech
    continued to come through on this day as they placed 3rd with great
    handoffs. MIT ran 44.80 due to the strong winds keeping the times
    slow.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 1500 was stacked with All American Dave Patterson from Tufts
    as well as Steeple All American, Justin Easter from Bates. Rounding
    out the elite field was Pat Vardaro from Bowdoin who ran in the
    indoor 5000 at nationals. MIT had their hands full but seemed more
    than capable of handling the task. Brian Anderson took the lead for a
    brief period after 700 meters. This move picked the pace up
    considerably as the leaders went from running 68 to 63 for the
    quarter. Sean Montgomery took the lead to stay with 400 to go,
    running the final 300 meters in 44 seconds. Anderson finished 2nd
    with Sean Nolan, continuing to surprise, taking 4th behind
    Vardaro.
    
    
    
    
    
    At this point the meet was well in hand but the Engineers
    continued to perform as if the meet was on the line. Marc Washington
    came through big in the sprints with times of 11.20 for the victory
    in the 100, and 22.63 to finish 2nd in the 200. Both times were
    personal bests for Marc. He was supported by Robbie Gray in the dash
    (11.72), and Yuval Mazor in the 200 (23.14)
    
    
    
    
    
    Mazor led the way for MIT in the 400 with a 50.69 under very windy
    conditions to place 4th. Matt Lehman ran a personal best 50.94 to
    come in 6th.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 400IH was one event that was a bit of a disappointment for
    Tech. Expecting to dominate after Greg Devine from Tufts, MIT instead
    only secured 2nd and 4th places by Mark Jeunnette and Tony Pelosi.
    Scheduled to run but unable to due to the scheduling of the jumps in
    the indoor arena were Victor Williamson and Adrian Townsend. Craig
    Mielcarz also had to sit out this event as well as the 110HH due to
    his ailing hamstring.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 800 got things going in the right direction again as
    Montgomery and Anderson performed their 1-2 act once again. Sean won
    in 1:58.48 and Brian added in a 1:59.00. MIT went 1-2 in every event
    from the 800 to the 5000. Sean Nolan came back from his 1500 to win
    the 5K in 15:23.49 and was followed closely by teammate Ed Keehr in
    15:25.04.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the other jumps, Mielcarz jumped 6-6 right after his long jump,
    before he iced his leg, to win that event. In the Pole Vault, MIT
    showed their strength as Sam Thibault led an assault by the Tech
    vaulters with a personal best of 14-9. Dan Kwon earned 2nd with 14-0
    and Dan Opila came in 3rd with 13-6. Kalpak Kothari jumped well but
    missed first by 2 centimeters with a triple jump of 44-2 1/2.
    Supporting Kalpak were Williamson in 4th and Gray in 7th.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the remaining two throws, Francisco Cruz came through with a
    5th place in the Shot Put (40-7), and Chris Khan won the Discus with
    a final throw of 149-2. Greg Walker, having had a non-scoring PR in
    the hammer, made this one count with another PR of 122-11.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final running event was the 4x400 relay. MIT was favored but
    both Bowdoin and Tufts had run mid 3:20 times this season. With good
    performances in the open 400, MIT decided to go for a good time
    despite the windy conditions. Jeunnette led off with a fine 51.7
    split, exactly the same as the week before. Anderson followed with a
    51.5, also the same as last week. At this point MIT had a 50 meter
    lead and for all practical purposes the race was over. Nevertheless,
    Lehman continued to have a good day, running 50.1. Mazor finished off
    his 4 performance day running a 50.8 to bring the baton home
    first.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Engineers had a very good day overall. With the expected
    return of Hoying and Rajter next week the team looks to start getting
    ready for the Championships. The final tune-up of the season will be
    at the Northeastern Invitational next Saturday starting at
    10:00AM.

    **MIELCARZ AND MICHALAKIS COLLECT
    RECORDS**
    
    
    
    **Varsity High Jump and Freshman Hammer Records
    Fall in ECAC Division III Championship**
    
    
    
    
    
    May 17-18, 2001
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT's Men's Track and Field team entered the ECAC Division III
    Championships, hosted by Springfield College, with the sole purpose
    of qualifying people for nationals, or improving the marks of those
    who had already qualified. Given the cool, windy conditions, one
    automatic mark and two improved provisional marks were quite an
    accomplishment. Six season bests along with a varsity record in the
    High Jump and yet another freshman record in the Hammer made the meet
    an incredible one for MIT.
    
    
    
    
    
    The first annual ECAC Division III Championship for Men was held
    on a Thursday and Friday because of Springfield's graduation. The
    meet, basically a last chance qualifier that few schools treat as a
    scoring meet, much less a team championship, was attended by colleges
    from the New England states as well as New York, New Jersey, and
    Pennsylvania. MIT had qualified 25 individuals, many in more than one
    event, but only brought 10 along because of the team philosophy to
    treat this meet as an opportunity only for those with a chance of
    going to the NCAA Championship.
    
    
    
    
    
    The first day had the trials in the 100 and 110HH as well as the
    Hammer Throw. Marc Washington ran a fine 11.18 into a slight headwind
    to make Friday's final. Rick Rajter followed suit in the High Hurdles
    with a 15.23.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the Hammer, Marios Michalakis and Chris Khan waged their
    friendly weekly war to decide who would end up with the freshman
    Hammer Throw record. Chris, who was in possession of the record,
    opened with a near record performance of 169-5. On his second throw,
    Marios unleashed a 172-0 effort to take the record and 6th place in
    the competition. Neither improved on these marks even though they
    both had their best series of the season. Marios's throw has him
    ranked 20th in the division III national ranking.
    
    
    
    
    
    Friday's competition opened up with the High Jump. Craig Mielcarz
    had jumped 6-9 two weeks in succession. Unfortunately, the following
    heights had increased to 6-11, which Craig did not make. His 6-9
    success had him ranked in a tie for 13th on the national list with 5
    other athletes. This was enough to convince Craig he needed to jump
    in hopes of getting the automatic standard of 6-9 1/2. Craig had a
    shaky start and did not seem "into the competition", missing attempts
    at 6-3 1/2, 6-5 3/4, and at 6-8. At 6-9 1/2 Craig missed his first
    two attempts badly, but cleared the third attempt by at least 2".
    Having made the automatic standard, the height went to 6-11 1/2.
    Craig had the height on all attempts as well as a solid effort on his
    second attempt, but was not able to clear it. Craig's jump set the
    MIT varsity record and placed him second in the meet.
    
    
    
    
    
    The first event on the track for MIT was the 1500. Freshman Brian
    Anderson was attempting to improve on his provisional mark of
    3:55.65. Sean Montgomery, seeded 3rd in the 800 was running the 1500
    to help Brian with the pace and to see what kind of strength he had
    after missing so much training due to his quad injury. Sean was
    shoved back at the start and stumbled badly going in to the first
    turn. Brian took the lead on the backstretch and came through the
    first quarter in 62. Brian backed off at the 600 mark so Sean moved
    to the lead. Coming through splits of 2:05 and 3:07, Sean looked
    great. Brian had seemed to lose focus and was fading quickly. Sean
    eased in to the finish, getting passed in the final 10 meters, but
    ran a solid national qualifying time of 3:53.05.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the 110HH final, Rick Rajter ran his best race of the year. It
    was a technically sound race from start to finish. However, it was
    into a headwind, leaving Rick with a 15.14 performance, good enough
    for 3rd place, but not improving on his provisional qualifying time
    of 14.88.
    
    
    
    
    
    Kalpak Kothari was also trying to better his provisional
    performance in the Triple Jump. Kalpak's best is 46-6 and he needed a
    47-3 or so to give him a solid chance of making the NCAA field.
    Kalpak jumped well with a 44-8 performance, but was unable to put
    everything together on one jump.
    
    
    
    
    
    Yuval Mazor, primarily at the meet to see if the 1600 relay team
    could qualify for nationals, was running the open quarter to see if
    he could break the 50 second barrier. Seeded 21st with a 50.49, Yuval
    went out perhaps a little too hard in his section. Yuval definitely
    had the look of one struggling to make the finish but nevertheless
    ran a PR of 50.09 to place 7th on this windy day. A conservative
    first 200 would surely have brought the sub 50 quarter he was looking
    for.
    
    
    
    
    
    Chris Khan stuck around the second day to see if he could get a
    little more practice in the Discus. With qualifying already taken
    care of, Chris did not seem very psyched to be competing. Off balance
    and not aggressive, Chris struggled to throw 144'. On the plus side,
    Chris has worked some of his flaws out and should be ready to compete
    at nationals.
    
    
    
    
    
    Marc Washington, at the meet primarily as an alternate in the 1600
    relay, was also taking advantage of the opportunity to compete in
    open events. Looking good the day before with his 11.18, Marc did not
    bring any of that magic with him on the 2nd day. Marc ran 11.41 and
    22.92 in the 100 and 200 finals.
    
    
    
    
    
    Mark Jeunnette, another MIT runner in Springfield for the 1600
    Relay, participated in the 400IH in hopes of reaching a provisional
    qualifying mark. Mark ran a good race but lost time on the 6th and
    7th hurdle. His time of 56.14 was his best of the season, but no
    where near his potential.
    
    
    
    
    
    As usual, the 1600 Relay was the final event of the day. Due to
    Marc Washington's bad day and Rick Rajter having suffered through a
    stomach ailment all day, MIT was putting together their ninth
    different combination of the season to try again to qualify for
    nationals. This iteration had Mark Jeunnette leading off, which he
    did as well as anyone has all season, running 50.4. Yuval continued
    to show he is a better relay runner than an open runner as he once
    again broke 49, this time with a 48.7 split. Brian Anderson was up
    next. Brian got out well but after the 200 mark seemed to lose focus.
    He was passed, which seemed to wake him up. The last 100 meters was a
    battle with the Amherst runner, which certainly did not help Brian's
    time. The third split was 50.2. Sean Montgomery got out well on the
    anchor leg but seemed to be holding back for the first 300 meters. As
    he was getting passed by two more teams, he picked it up and finished
    very strong, running a 49.4 split. Sean, it turned out had a tight
    hamstring that he was concerned about and did not want to go out too
    quickly. The overall time of 3:18.71 was the best of the season, but
    not good enough to make nationals.

    **TECH FALLS TO RPI IN ENGINEER'S
    CUP**
    
    
    
    April 7, 2001
    
    
    
    
    
    In order to do better in the Championships, MIT's Men's Track and
    Field team had to hold some key individuals out of the Engineer's Cup
    so that they might heal enough to be productive later on. In doing
    so, RPI took advantage and outscored MIT by a score of 178 1/2 to 162
    with WPI trailing with 46 1/2 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    After a productive spring trip, the Engineers of MIT realized many
    injuries which were thought to be healed but had indeed returned.
    Brian Hoying (HJ, LJ, 400), Sean Montgomery (1500, 800), Rick Rajter
    (110HH, HJ), John Biesiadecki (800) were all held out of the meet. In
    addition, Sam Thibault, Tech's #1 vaulter had to miss for personal
    reasons. Nevertheless, MIT went into the meet with the intent of
    trying to win. With only the Triple Jump and Discus remaining, RPI
    had a 2 1/2 point lead. However, despite Kalpak Kothari's winning
    effort of 44-3 1/4 in the Triple and Chris Khan's second place effort
    of 152-11 (new freshman record) in the Discus, RPI outscored MIT
    27-13 in those events. The scoring in the three way meet went
    7-5-4-3-2-1 for 1st through 6th places with relays scoring 7-4-0.
    
    
    
    
    
    The highest scorer for MIT was Craig Mielcarz with 20 points.
    Craig won the High Jump (6-4) and 110HH (16.42), placed 4th in the
    Long Jump with 20-5, and scored a valuable 4th in the 400IH with a
    58.26. The only other double winner was freshman Brian Anderson with
    4:03.12 and 1:58.98 winning efforts in the 1500 and 800 runs. Many
    personal bests were established but the most significant was provided
    by Sean Nolan, who came through with a 4:05.77 best in the 1500 good
    enough for 2nd place. Other wins were provided by Yuval Mazor in the
    400 (50.54), Ed Keehr in the 5000 (15:30.81), Dan Kwon in the Pole
    Vault (13-6), and the 1600 Relay team of Mark Jeunnette, Anderson,
    Matt Lehman and Mazor (3:24.84).
    
    
    
    
    
    One event that hurt MIT's score minimally was the 200. RPI's
    automatic timing system did not capture either section of the event
    and due to an inadequate budget did not have enough timers at the
    finish line to capture the times. In addition, the two timers they
    did have were told the camera had worked so they reset their watches
    before recording the times. The result was a win by MIT's Marc
    Washington in a hand time of 22.4 was for naught. MIT also appeared
    to garner 3rd and 5th, which would have given them a 4 point
    advantage over the final score.
    
    
    
    
    
    Coach Halston Taylor feels the team gave it their all. "Whenever
    some of the top performers are out of the competition, a true
    championship team has others step-up to take up the scoring
    responsibilities. We did that for the most part. We have not produced
    the way we should in the horizontal jumps, and did not have a good
    day today in the Javelin or Shot Put. The rest we are giving our top
    performers should pay off in the Championships, which when combined
    with the others who are getting experience at taking up the slack,
    should produce better team results. I was proud of the effort
    today."
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the Engineers take a trip up to Brunswick, Maine to do
    battle against Bowdoin, Tufts and UMass Lowell.

    April 21, 2001
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT Men's Track and Field team took a weekend off from scoring
    meets to go to the Husky Invitational hosted by Northeastern
    University at their track in Dedham. Tech endured the long time
    schedule with hopes of attaining some good performances against the
    mostly Division I and II field. The warm temperatures and strong but
    inconsistent tailwind aided the jumpers and sprinters but did little
    to assist the other performers.
    
    
    
    
    
    Many personal and season bests were achieved and not just by the
    sprinters and jumpers. Consistently, throughout the day, Tech runners
    passed people in the homestretch to finish their races strong. In the
    middle distance and distance events MIT competed well and each event
    had at least a season best despite the strong winds. Matt Yarosz ran
    a very even paced 1500 to knock 3 seconds off his best in running a
    4:10.80 time. In the Steeple Chase, Craig Wildman shaved a few tenths
    off his performance with an aggressive race leading to a 9:57.11
    time. Sean Nolan ran his best outdoor 5000 by far in placing 3rd with
    a 15:06.64.
    
    
    
    
    
    Season bests were achieved in the 800 by George Hanson (2:01.83),
    Alan Raphael (2:02.20), and Matt Yarosz (2:03.99). All finished
    strong, showing there may be more to come in the Championships next
    weekend.
    
    
    
    
    
    Mark Jeunnette went out much stronger than he has in earlier meets
    in the 400IH. He ran a season best of 56.67 but may have run much
    faster were it not for a severe stutter on the final hurdle. As it
    was, he finished 4th and must wait until next week to see if he can
    put the whole race together. All three 400 runners won their
    respective sections but the wind was just too strong to guarantee
    good performances. Yuval Mazor ran 51.02, Matt Lehman 51.14 and Todd
    Rosenfield 52.29. Again, all finished very strong, passing many in
    the final 100 meters.
    
    
    
    
    
    Mark Washington had a pretty good day, running a PR in the 200
    with a 22.57 to place 4th and a 11.28 in the 100 despite a slow
    start. Marc has come a long way in the sprints this year. Thus far,
    he has dropped his time in the 100 by .16 and in the 200 by .53. MIT
    is hoping for big things once Marc gets his start down. Robbie Gray
    also ran a season best in the 100 with a clocking of 11.50.
    
    
    
    
    
    Rick Rajter ran the 110HH for the second time this year and
    recorded a PR of 15.32. He has a lot of room for improvement so the
    future is bright if Rick can stay healthy. Junius Ho, nursing a
    tender hamstring also ran a season best of 16.54, but that is far
    from Junius's personal best of 15.73.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the field events, Dan Kwon led the way with his second PR in as
    many weeks. Dan jumped 14-6 to qualify for the All New England
    Championships. Overall the vaulters did well in the meet with Sam
    Thibault also clearing 14-6 and having some very good attempts at
    15-0. Dan Opila cleared 13-6 for the 2nd consecutive week.
    
    
    
    
    
    Kalpak Kothari continued to improve each week, jumping 45-0 1/2 in
    the Triple Jump to set his best mark of the season and only 3" behind
    his best ever. Also jumping well in the horizontal jumps was Robbie
    Gray, who set season best in both the Long Jump (20-10 3/4) and
    Triple Jump (41-0 1/2). Victor Williamson, just beginning to recover
    from his overused legs, jumped 41-6 in the Triple Jump for his season
    best.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the throws, Spiros Michalakis is beginning to return to good
    form in the Javelin. Spiros threw 161' for his season best. In the
    Hammer, Scott Bradley has a PR of 123-8, just ahead of David Saylor's
    PR of 121-8.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the Engineers travel to WPI to compete in the New
    England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Championship.
    This is the 3rd year of the Championship. The first year, MIT won but
    last year Springfield won on their home track.

    **MEN'S TRACK SAVES BEST FOR LAST**
    
    
    
    **MIT Places 11th at NCAA
    Championships**
    
    
    
    
    
    May 25-27, 2001
    
    
    
    
    
    Amid final exams, four members of the MIT Men's Track and Field
    team left Cambridge Wednesday morning to leave their mark on the 2001
    NCAA Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championships being held at
    Milikin University in Decatur, Illinois. They surpassed their goal,
    placing 11th among the hundreds of schools in Division III with 18
    points.
    
    
    
    
    
    Although seven men made at least the provisional qualifying
    standard for these championships, only four were seeded high enough
    to make the trip. The NCAA generally takes the top 16 individuals per
    event in the Outdoor Championship. Those representing MIT were Sean
    Montgomery '01, in the 800, Craig Mielcarz '03, in the High Jump,
    Marios Michalakis '04, in the Hammer, and Chris Khan '04, in both the
    Hammer and Discus.
    
    
    
    
    
    On the first of three days of competition, Chris Khan was
    scheduled to compete in the Discus, in which he was seeded 11th.
    Relaxed, even though he still had an important 3 hour exam to take
    after the competition, Chris tanked his first two throws. On his
    third throw, he stepped in the slick circle a little slower,
    accelerated into his release and threw far enough to make it to
    finals in 6th position. In the finals, Chris continued to improve on
    each throw, but was not able to move up in position on his first two
    throws. In the third round, Chris was passed, pushing him back to
    7th. "King Khan" responded with a new freshman and varsity record of
    169-7 to move up to 5th place. Chris's place earned him All-America
    honors and gave MIT it's first 4 points in the competition.
    
    
    
    
    
    On day two, Craig Mielcarz was up in the High Jump. Jumping last
    among the 18 jumpers, Craig had to patiently wait through the five
    alive rotations. At 6-5, nearly everyone, including Craig made the
    height on the first attempt. After 6-7, while Craig again cleared on
    his first attempt, five of the competitors had fouled out. At 6-9,
    Craig made it on his 2nd attempt, as 8 others also made the height.
    Unless everyone but Craig were to make 6-11, he was set to score and
    make All-America. At 6-11, each jumper took one attempt in order
    before weather forced a suspension in the competition. Only one of
    the jumpers made the height in that round. If no one else were to
    clear after the competition resumed, Craig would tie for 3rd with two
    other jumpers. Thirty minutes later, the competition resumed and no
    one else was able to clear 6-11 through the second round of attempts.
    In the third round Craig was up as the final jumper with no one else
    able to make the height. Craig cleared the height, just brushing the
    bar on the way over. With two jumpers remaining, the bar went to 7-1.
    Craig needed to clear the height to win, and had three very good
    attempts at it, just hitting the bar with his legs on his final
    attempt. Craig earned 2nd place, set the MIT record, and earned 8
    points for the Engineers.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final event for MIT on day two was the 800 trials. The 800 is
    typically an event where the difference in time from first to last
    seed is only about 2 seconds. Sean was seeded 3rd and would have to
    place among the top 2 in his heat or be one of the next two fastest
    individuals among the entire field. Sean's heat went out quickly,
    allowing Sean to do what he likes best; move up from the rear. The
    first 400 was 54 flat for Sean as he moved up to 2nd position. Sean
    stayed in that position, moving up on the leader to finish in
    1:51.47, .2 seconds behind the leader and 2nd overall in the
    trials.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final day began with the Hammer for MIT. The two freshmen were
    seeded 14th and 16th among the 16 throwers. This is the first time in
    a few years a freshman has made it into the Hammer field at
    nationals, and certainly the first time in memory that two freshmen
    made the field from the same school. However, all this did not
    guarantee them a place in the finals, they would have to earn it.
    Chris Khan, finally hoping to try some three turn throws, never got
    the chance to see a fair throw. Chris fouled his first two turn throw
    as well as his next two three turn efforts. The first two fouls were
    sector fouls and the last hit the gate. Marios Michalakis, the
    current freshman record holder with a throw of 175-3, was not able to
    get a good throw off in the very slippery circle. The best he was
    able to muster was a 162 effort, which earned him a 13th place
    finish.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final event for MIT was the 800. Just as Sean Montgomery was
    getting ready for his final check-in, thirty minutes prior to his
    event, the rain and lightening came in, causing a meet delay. Thirty
    five minutes later they called for the athletes to return. The delay
    was not an obstacle for Sean who is experienced in these meets and
    handles problems well. The wind was blowing hard but that did not
    prevent the runners from taking the pace out fast. Sean worked his
    way up through the group, coming through the quarter in 53.8 in 4th
    place. Coming down the backstretch it looked like Sean was ready to
    make a move but then he seemed to fatigue. Nevertheless, Sean held on
    and worked the final curve, moving up on the leaders. In the final
    straight, Sean passed the 3rd place runner and closed on 2nd place.
    However, he ran out of track and settled for 3rd place in 1:51.98.
    This gave MIT their 18 points and best finish since 1989.

    **GREAT TEAM PERFORMANCE EARNS 2ND PLACE IN
    NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
    
    May 5, 2001
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT, seeded 28 points behind Wheaton College and 87 behind
    Williams College, had an incredible display of team track and field
    as they placed second to Williams 143.5 to 105. On a mostly sunny,
    but very windy day, the Engineers had nine personal bests and four
    more season bests as they scored 38 points more than they were
    seeded.
    
    
    
    
    
    Things started going Tech's way with the first event on Saturday,
    the 10K. Ed Keehr, seeded second battled for 6 miles with the favored
    runner from Keene State, dropping him with 400 to go, running a 66
    last quarter to win by nearly 6 seconds in a personal best of
    32:01.93. Frank Johnston, seeded 18th, having recovered from his bout
    of Salmonella last week, showed what he is capable of when he placed
    8th in 33:10.99.
    
    
    
    
    
    The next event, the Hammer, brought another freshman record for
    Chris Khan. Chris, already owning the freshman record in the Discus,
    threw 169-6 to place 6th, and take the record away from John
    Wallberg. Chris qualified provisionally for the NCAA Championships,
    but he is only ranked 23rd at this time and will need to improve to
    make it to Nationals.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Long Jump was just not to be a good event for MIT this year.
    Even though Tech had 3 jumpers over 21' and three more over 20', they
    could not put together a jump to place in these Championships. Craig
    Mielcarz set a season best of 21-1 1/2, but that was only good enough
    for 10th. The only good news for MIT was that Wheaton was seeded
    1-2-3 going into the event and was only able to pull out a first and
    third.
    
    
    
    
    
    Craig did come through big in the High Jump, clearing 6-9 on his
    first attempt to place 2nd. Craig had a good first attempt at 6-11
    but it was not quite there. Rick Rajter cleared 6-1 1/2 to place 7th.
    It would have taken a leap of 6-5 to place any higher. Craig
    qualified provisionally for the NCAA Championship with his
    effort.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Pole Vault was also being contested at this time. All three
    MIT vaulters placed in the team's best event. Sam Thibault was the
    most successful at battling the inconsistent cross wind as he won the
    event with a vault of 14-3 1/4. Dan Opila set a season best of 13-11
    1/4 as he placed 3rd. Dan Kwon tied for 5th with 13-3, bringing MIT's
    point total in the event to 19.
    
    
    
    
    
    At this point in the meet, MIT had scored 43 points but Wheaton
    had amassed 34 points to keep pace. Both teams had successful
    preliminary rounds on the track but Wheaton had much more scoring
    potential in the these races. Wheaton had 3 in the finals of the 100,
    2 in the 200, and 1 in the 400 coming out of the trials. MIT had
    qualified Rick Rajter in the 110HH, Marc Washington in the 200, and
    Tony Pelosi in the 400IH in the early round.
    
    
    
    
    
    During the break in the running action, Chris Khan went to work
    again, this time in the Discus. Chris spotted the field about 15' in
    the trials but unloaded a throw of 152-11 to tie his freshman record
    and win the event by 4'. Chris is hoping to qualify for nationals in
    the next two weeks.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Triple Jump was a hotly contested event. Wheaton was seeded
    1-3-6 going in, and Kalpak Kothari of MIT was seeded 5th. Wheaton
    only finished 1-6 to help Tech's cause and Kalpak unloaded a 46-6 3/4
    jump on his last attempt to move up to 4th place. What was supposed
    to be a 19-4 scoring difference turned out to be 13-5, a 7 point
    swing. Kalpak joined the MIT ranks of national provisional qualifiers
    with his jump.
    
    
    
    
    
    The first running event on the track after the trials was the 3000
    Steeplechase. Craig Wildman made a valiant effort at trying to score
    but the ambitious effort left him in severe oxygen debt at the end as
    he faded to 11th. Williams College showed their dominance in this
    event by placing 1-2-5-7 to score 24 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next, the 400 Relay was supposed to be a battle between Wheaton
    and Williams and that is exactly what happened until the final leg
    when Bates College split the teams up. Wheaton pulled out the victory
    with a 42.17 effort. Bates College ran very well to finish 2nd and
    take a couple of points away from Williams. MIT did not enter a team
    due to their low seed and the fragile state of Rick Rajter, who would
    do well to hold together for the meet without the 4x100. The score
    was now MIT 58, Wheaton 57.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 1500 had Brian Anderson from MIT seeded 5th. What the rest of
    the field did not know was that Brian was ready to run fast. Mark
    Miller, the defending indoor national champion from Keene State took
    the pace out despite the wind in 61 for the first 400. Brian went
    with him hoping he would be able to hang on and use his 800 speed to
    surprise Miller at the end if the pace slowed a little. The 800 split
    was 2:05 and the 1200 3:08. Miller began to pull away at this point
    as Brian slowed a bit. Coming into the final straight, runners from
    Trinity and Williams made a desperate attempt to catch Brian but came
    a little short as all three ran 3:55. Brian's second place time of
    3:55.65 provisionally qualifies him for nationals.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 110HH was next and Rick Rajter was ready. Rick has run faster
    in each race this season. In the trials he set another PR of 15.16,
    the second fastest time in the trials. Rick was only seeded 6th so it
    was looking like more good news for MIT. True to form, Rick set
    another PR in the finals, this time breaking 15 seconds with a 14.88
    for second place. With a slow start and reaching for the finish, Rick
    has plenty of room for more personal bests. Rick's time not only
    moves him into the top 10 at MIT, but all the way to #6 all time.
    Rick's time also provisionally qualifies him for nationals.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT was on a roll, but they had to take a break and watch as the
    next two events did not have a Tech entry. Wheaton however was seeded
    to score 28 points in the two events. In the 100, things went pretty
    much as predicted. Stanley Egbor of Worcester State showed why he is
    one of the top sprinters in the country with his 10.48 victory.
    Wheaton did not quite get what the were seeded to score, but
    nevertheless racked up 15 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    New England Division III track and field has improved a lot in the
    last 5 years and the 400 race was a good example. It took a 49.77 to
    make the finals on this day despite the wind. In the finals, Erik
    Zwick of Bates beat the favored freshman from Wheaton with a 48.57
    victory. The 23 points for Wheaton in the two events brought the
    score to Wheaton 80, MIT 74.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next on the track was the 800. Sean Montgomery of MIT was seeded
    first and he did not disappoint. Sean let the field do the work as he
    moved up during the first 400. The slow first quarter pace of 57 did
    not help Sean in his bid for a better national qualifying
    performance, but it did not affect the outcome. Sean held back
    against the wind on the backstretch but opened up in the final 200 to
    bring it home in 1:53.40 for first place.
    
    
    
    
    
    Tony Pelosi , seeded 13th going into the trials of the 400IH, ran
    a 56.06 to win his heat and get himself lane 5 in the finals. In the
    final, Tony had to reach for the first hurdle but held 15 steps
    throughout 6 hurdles despite running into the wind. Coming home Tony
    looked strong, finishing 5th in 56.00. Again Williams showed their
    depth by placing 1-2-3 to score 24 points. Freshman Adrian Townsend
    served notice he would be back as he ran his race in 57.92 in the
    trials, missing the finals by 1 position.
    
    
    
    
    
    The score was now 88 for MIT and 80 for Wheaton. The 200, a strong
    event for Wheaton was next. Marc Washington of MIT ran a 22.32 PR in
    the trials to make it into the finals. In the final, Egbor again
    dominated, running 20.94 for the win. Wheaton dropped the ball, and
    their chance to catch MIT, by only earning 10 points. Washington
    placed 6th to give MIT 3 more points and 91 total.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sean Nolan was Tech's lone warrior in the 5000. Moving up through
    the field cautiously during the first mile and a half due to the
    ambitious pace, Sean nevertheless came through 2 miles in 9:32. By
    this point Sean had moved up to 5th place and was in position to move
    into 4th when his gas began to run out. The final mile was very
    challenging for Nolan who managed to summon a 33 final 200 to hold
    off the closing field. Sean's 15:10.7 was not his best time, but it
    was a great effort that was worthy of 5th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final race, the 4x400 relay, was seeded to be very
    competitive. The top 8 teams had run between 3:18.10 and 3:23.95. MIT
    was seeded 6th with their time of 3:22.34. Pride was at stake for MIT
    who had won this race the last three championships (twice indoor and
    last year outdoor). Despite losing Brian Hoying earlier in the season
    to an injury in the groin area, and Matt Lehman to a hamstring injury
    last week, the Engineers refused to accept the underdog role. Rick
    Rajter stepped up to run the 400 for the first time despite being
    exhausted from the heat and his earlier races. Rick's leadoff leg of
    50.4 put Tech in the lead. Yuval Mazor, normally MIT's fastest leg,
    moved up a leg to guarantee MIT would not have to move out of lane 1
    on the exchanges. This would save MIT some time that they anticipated
    needing given the alternate legs they were using. Yuval ran a 49.4
    leg to open up the lead to about 5 meters over Springfield. Todd
    Rosenfield, brought along as an alternate because he has not been
    able to return to his performance level of last year after the bout
    with mono in the winter, went out hard and never gave up. Todd held
    on strong in the final straight to run 50.6 and give Sean Montgomery
    a 1/2 step lead over the anchor leg from Springfield who had placed
    5th earlier in the open 400. The Springfield runner took the lead on
    the first turn, which was probably the best thing he could do to help
    MIT. Sean does not tend to push the first 200 if he is in the lead,
    but he can run with just about anyone from New England if he is
    trailing. Sean trailed until the final straight when he pulled
    alongside and finally past Springfield in the final 10 meters. Sean
    ran a 48.4 anchor for a winning time of 3:19.07.
    
    
    
    
    
    Coach Halston Taylor feels this effort by his team was the best
    such championship effort he had witnessed by an MIT team since 1989.
    "Even though we finished 38 1/2 points behind Williams, the losses we
    faced this year due to injuries (two All-Americans, two national
    qualifiers and one Division III runner-up), people who quit and those
    who elected to do something other than outdoor track (one national
    qualifier and a freshman record holder), combined with the fact that
    the team had to split up and practice in three different venues while
    the outdoor track is being resurfaced, this group of guys stepped up
    and got the job done. I am very proud of this team."
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week the Men's team will be at UConn to compete in the All
    Division New England Championship.

    Twenty point favorites going into the New England Women's and
    Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Championship, MIT was not taking
    anything for granted. Everyone on the team did their share as 39 of
    the eventual points came from individuals who were either sick,
    injured, or competing for the first time after being injured.
    Everyone stepped up and responded when it counted, taking up the
    slack for those whose season has ended due to injury. MIT scored 237
    1/2 points to outscore runner-up Springfield by 56.5 points. Coast
    Guard was a distant third with 146.5 and was followed by Wheaton with
    124, host WPI with 53 and new comer Babson with 23.
    
    
    
    
    
    Thirty-one different Tech competitors scored. Sean Montgomery led
    the way for MIT with 20 points as he won the 1500 (3:57.37), placed
    2nd in the 800 (1:57.22) and anchored the 1600R to a 2nd place
    finish. Sean has been nursing a quad injury for 3 weeks and showed
    his lack of conditioning but not a lack of competitiveness. Close to
    Sean's 20 points were Rick Rajter with 19.5 and Craig Mielcarz with
    19. Rick won the 110HH with a PR of 15.18, placed 4th in the High
    Jump with a leap of 6-3 1/2, ran his first 200 of the year in 23.11
    for 8th, and anchored the 400 Relay to a 3rd place finish. Craig won
    the High Jump in a season best of 6-7, placed 7th in the Long Jump
    with another season best of 21-0 3/4, ran a 15.93 PR in the 110HH to
    place 5th and ran out of gas in the 400IH with a 60.23 but still
    managed to place 6th in the strong winds at WPI. Chris Khan
    represented the freshman class with 18 points in the throwing events.
    The slick hammer/discus circle gave everyone problems so PRs were not
    in abundance but Chris nevertheless won the Discus with a throw of
    141-11 and also placed 5th in the Hammer (149-6) and set a 42-6 3/4
    PR in the Shot Put for another 5th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    The only other event winner was sophomore Sean Nolan who first
    placed 6th in the 1500 with a 4:05.79 performance before winning the
    5K in 15:15.39. Other mulitple place winners included Marc Washington
    with a 2nd in the 200 (22.34), 4th in the 100 (11.04) and lead off
    leg in the 400 Relay. Both of Marc's individual performances were
    personal bests. Robbie Gray was another member of the 400 Relay who
    scored in other events. Robbie placed 5th in the Long Jump with a
    leap of 21-2 1/2 and 8th in the 100 with a trial and season best of
    11.46. Freshman Victor Williamson began to put things together as he
    set PRs in both the 110HH (16.06) for 6th and the Triple Jump (42-4
    1/4). Another freshman who took care of business was Brian Anderson.
    Brian set a PR in the 1500 of 3:59.61 while placing 3rd and ran a
    1:58.05 to place 4th in the 800. Brian also led off the 1600 Relay
    with a 51.8 split. Yuval Mazor, a member of both relays, also placed
    4th in the 400 with a season best 50.49. Mark Jeunnette, who had
    strained his quad coming off a hurdle poorly in practice earlier in
    the week, placed 4th in the 400IH with a 58.09 and 8th in the Javelin
    with a 147-6.
    
    
    
    
    
    The extraordinary performances were many for the Engineers. Adrian
    Townsend, running his first 400IH of the season because he missed the
    bus for one meet and was indoors competing in the Triple Jump 1/2
    mile away from the outdoor track during another meet, placed 2nd out
    of the slow section with a 57.65 first ever effort. David Shearer,
    after missing the indoor season with mono, added two feet to his best
    MIT mark with a 41-6 effort in the Triple Jump, good enough for 5th
    place. Frank Johnston, suffering from the flu, but competing in
    possibly his last MIT meet ever, ran a personal best in the 10K with
    a34:15.76 for 2nd place. The most heroic efforts of the meet also
    came in the 10K. MIT, depleted of many of their fine distance runners
    because of their best runner not participating in outdoor track to
    run the Boston marathon, two other sub 16:00 5K runners not
    participating because of minor injuries which encouraged them to
    retain their eligibility for the year, and one former sub 15:00
    national qualifier who has has a nagging injury since September,
    looked to two non qualifiers to try and score in this typically weak
    event in the NEWMAC. John Biesiadecki, a 1500 runner diagnosed with
    an abdominal tear and needing surgery, elected to compete in the 10K
    since it was determined he could not do worse damage to the injury
    and it was his last opportunity to compete since he would be
    graduating in June. Taku Iida, an 800 runner who would not get to
    compete in the meet in his event since each school is only permitted
    4 entries per event, also elected to compete in the 10K. Both stepped
    up and scored points by placing 4th and 5th respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    The victory was a true team effort. MIT has now won the meet two
    of the three years the Championship has been held. Next week, the
    Engineers travel to Connecticut College to compete in the New England
    Division III Championships. The team hopes to finish among the top 3
    teams.

    **MIT MEN'S TRACK AND FIELD SPRINGS INTO
    OUTDOOR SEASON WITH SEVENTEEN NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III QUALIFYING
    MARKS**
    
    
    
    March 31, 2001
    
    
    
    
    
    At the conclusion of a very warm and sunny week in California,
    twenty four members of the MIT track and field team represented their
    Institution in the University of California San Diego Invitational.
    Despite the hard week of training and the fact that this was the
    first meet of the outdoor season, seventeen New England Division III
    qualifying marks were achieved by the Engineers.
    
    
    
    
    
    Thanks to the very generous donations by the Friends of MIT Track
    and Field, the men's team took their annual spring break trip to the
    warm climate of California to kick start their outdoor season. Still
    working on the strength phase of their season, the Engineers
    nevertheless expected to perform well with the great competition
    offered at this meet.
    
    
    
    
    
    In addition to the New England Division III qualifying marks,
    their were twenty ECAC Division III qualifying marks achieved and
    four All New England marks. Leading the way was Sean Montgomery in
    the 800 meters. After running a 3:55.32 1500, Sean won the 800 with a
    1:52.77 effort. Rick Rajter, still feeling the effects of an injured
    hamstring during the indoor season, only competed in the 110HH and
    High Jump. Rick showed his tremendous potential by running 15.55
    after a poor start and a slight breakdown in form in the middle of
    the race. Rick also jumped 6-4 in the High Jump. On Friday night, Ed
    Keehr ran the 10,000 meter race in 32:24.8. Ed maintained a
    consistent pace with his slowest 400 being a 79 and his fastest being
    a 75. The final All New England qualifying performance was turned in
    by the 4x400 relay team with a 3:22.34. Brian Hoying led the foursome
    off with a 51.7 after jumping 21-2 1/2 in the Long Jump, 6-6 in the
    High Jump and 51.23 in the 400. Mark Jeunnette took the baton and
    made up some ground on the Division I schools with a 50.5 leg. Mark
    also had a busy day with a 1:56.50 800 and a 59.82 400IH that
    included a full fall and roll after the 5th hurdle. Yuval Mazor ran
    the third leg in 49.6 to close the gap on the leaders. Yuval had run
    50.98 in the 400 and 23.55 in the 200, both out of lane 9, earlier in
    the day.

    following:
