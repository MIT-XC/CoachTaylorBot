<P>April 28, 2001</P>

<P>Twenty point favorites going into the New England Women's and
Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Championship, MIT was not taking
anything for granted. Everyone on the team did their share as 39 of
the eventual points came from individuals who were either sick,
injured, or competing for the first time after being injured.
Everyone stepped up and responded when it counted, taking up the
slack for those whose season has ended due to injury. MIT scored 237
1/2 points to outscore runner-up Springfield by 56.5 points. Coast
Guard was a distant third with 146.5 and was followed by Wheaton with
124, host WPI with 53 and new comer Babson with 23.</P>

<P>Thirty-one different Tech competitors scored. Sean Montgomery led
the way for MIT with 20 points as he won the 1500 (3:57.37), placed
2nd in the 800 (1:57.22) and anchored the 1600R to a 2nd place
finish. Sean has been nursing a quad injury for 3 weeks and showed
his lack of conditioning but not a lack of competitiveness. Close to
Sean's 20 points were Rick Rajter with 19.5 and Craig Mielcarz with
19. Rick won the 110HH with a PR of 15.18, placed 4th in the High
Jump with a leap of 6-3 1/2, ran his first 200 of the year in 23.11
for 8th, and anchored the 400 Relay to a 3rd place finish. Craig won
the High Jump in a season best of 6-7, placed 7th in the Long Jump
with another season best of 21-0 3/4, ran a 15.93 PR in the 110HH to
place 5th and ran out of gas in the 400IH with a 60.23 but still
managed to place 6th in the strong winds at WPI. Chris Khan
represented the freshman class with 18 points in the throwing events.
The slick hammer/discus circle gave everyone problems so PRs were not
in abundance but Chris nevertheless won the Discus with a throw of
141-11 and also placed 5th in the Hammer (149-6) and set a 42-6 3/4
PR in the Shot Put for another 5th place.</P>

<P>The only other event winner was sophomore Sean Nolan who first
placed 6th in the 1500 with a 4:05.79 performance before winning the
5K in 15:15.39. Other mulitple place winners included Marc Washington
with a 2nd in the 200 (22.34), 4th in the 100 (11.04) and lead off
leg in the 400 Relay. Both of Marc's individual performances were
personal bests. Robbie Gray was another member of the 400 Relay who
scored in other events. Robbie placed 5th in the Long Jump with a
leap of 21-2 1/2 and 8th in the 100 with a trial and season best of
11.46. Freshman Victor Williamson began to put things together as he
set PRs in both the 110HH (16.06) for 6th and the Triple Jump (42-4
1/4). Another freshman who took care of business was Brian Anderson.
Brian set a PR in the 1500 of 3:59.61 while placing 3rd and ran a
1:58.05 to place 4th in the 800. Brian also led off the 1600 Relay
with a 51.8 split. Yuval Mazor, a member of both relays, also placed
4th in the 400 with a season best 50.49. Mark Jeunnette, who had
strained his quad coming off a hurdle poorly in practice earlier in
the week, placed 4th in the 400IH with a 58.09 and 8th in the Javelin
with a 147-6.</P>

<P>The extraordinary performances were many for the Engineers. Adrian
Townsend, running his first 400IH of the season because he missed the
bus for one meet and was indoors competing in the Triple Jump 1/2
mile away from the outdoor track during another meet, placed 2nd out
of the slow section with a 57.65 first ever effort. David Shearer,
after missing the indoor season with mono, added two feet to his best
MIT mark with a 41-6 effort in the Triple Jump, good enough for 5th
place. Frank Johnston, suffering from the flu, but competing in
possibly his last MIT meet ever, ran a personal best in the 10K with
a34:15.76 for 2nd place. The most heroic efforts of the meet also
came in the 10K. MIT, depleted of many of their fine distance runners
because of their best runner not participating in outdoor track to
run the Boston marathon, two other sub 16:00 5K runners not
participating because of minor injuries which encouraged them to
retain their eligibility for the year, and one former sub 15:00
national qualifier who has has a nagging injury since September,
looked to two non qualifiers to try and score in this typically weak
event in the NEWMAC. John Biesiadecki, a 1500 runner diagnosed with
an abdominal tear and needing surgery, elected to compete in the 10K
since it was determined he could not do worse damage to the injury
and it was his last opportunity to compete since he would be
graduating in June. Taku Iida, an 800 runner who would not get to
compete in the meet in his event since each school is only permitted
4 entries per event, also elected to compete in the 10K. Both stepped
up and scored points by placing 4th and 5th respectively.</P>

<P>The victory was a true team effort. MIT has now won the meet two
of the three years the Championship has been held. Next week, the
Engineers travel to Connecticut College to compete in the New England
Division III Championships. The team hopes to finish among the top 3
teams.</P>
