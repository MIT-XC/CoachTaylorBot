Championships</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>May 25-27, 2001</P>

<P>Amid final exams, four members of the MIT Men's Track and Field
team left Cambridge Wednesday morning to leave their mark on the 2001
NCAA Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championships being held at
Milikin University in Decatur, Illinois. They surpassed their goal,
placing 11th among the hundreds of schools in Division III with 18
points.</P>

<P>Although seven men made at least the provisional qualifying
standard for these championships, only four were seeded high enough
to make the trip. The NCAA generally takes the top 16 individuals per
event in the Outdoor Championship. Those representing MIT were Sean
Montgomery '01, in the 800, Craig Mielcarz '03, in the High Jump,
Marios Michalakis '04, in the Hammer, and Chris Khan '04, in both the
Hammer and Discus.</P>

<P>On the first of three days of competition, Chris Khan was
scheduled to compete in the Discus, in which he was seeded 11th.
Relaxed, even though he still had an important 3 hour exam to take
after the competition, Chris tanked his first two throws. On his
third throw, he stepped in the slick circle a little slower,
accelerated into his release and threw far enough to make it to
finals in 6th position. In the finals, Chris continued to improve on
each throw, but was not able to move up in position on his first two
throws. In the third round, Chris was passed, pushing him back to
7th. "King Khan" responded with a new freshman and varsity record of
169-7 to move up to 5th place. Chris's place earned him All-America
honors and gave MIT it's first 4 points in the competition.</P>

<P>On day two, Craig Mielcarz was up in the High Jump. Jumping last
among the 18 jumpers, Craig had to patiently wait through the five
alive rotations. At 6-5, nearly everyone, including Craig made the
height on the first attempt. After 6-7, while Craig again cleared on
his first attempt, five of the competitors had fouled out. At 6-9,
Craig made it on his 2nd attempt, as 8 others also made the height.
Unless everyone but Craig were to make 6-11, he was set to score and
make All-America. At 6-11, each jumper took one attempt in order
before weather forced a suspension in the competition. Only one of
the jumpers made the height in that round. If no one else were to
clear after the competition resumed, Craig would tie for 3rd with two
other jumpers. Thirty minutes later, the competition resumed and no
one else was able to clear 6-11 through the second round of attempts.
In the third round Craig was up as the final jumper with no one else
able to make the height. Craig cleared the height, just brushing the
bar on the way over. With two jumpers remaining, the bar went to 7-1.
Craig needed to clear the height to win, and had three very good
attempts at it, just hitting the bar with his legs on his final
attempt. Craig earned 2nd place, set the MIT record, and earned 8
points for the Engineers.</P>

<P>The final event for MIT on day two was the 800 trials. The 800 is
typically an event where the difference in time from first to last
seed is only about 2 seconds. Sean was seeded 3rd and would have to
place among the top 2 in his heat or be one of the next two fastest
individuals among the entire field. Sean's heat went out quickly,
allowing Sean to do what he likes best; move up from the rear. The
first 400 was 54 flat for Sean as he moved up to 2nd position. Sean
stayed in that position, moving up on the leader to finish in
1:51.47, .2 seconds behind the leader and 2nd overall in the
trials.</P>

<P>The final day began with the Hammer for MIT. The two freshmen were
seeded 14th and 16th among the 16 throwers. This is the first time in
a few years a freshman has made it into the Hammer field at
nationals, and certainly the first time in memory that two freshmen
made the field from the same school. However, all this did not
guarantee them a place in the finals, they would have to earn it.
Chris Khan, finally hoping to try some three turn throws, never got
the chance to see a fair throw. Chris fouled his first two turn throw
as well as his next two three turn efforts. The first two fouls were
sector fouls and the last hit the gate. Marios Michalakis, the
current freshman record holder with a throw of 175-3, was not able to
get a good throw off in the very slippery circle. The best he was
able to muster was a 162 effort, which earned him a 13th place
finish.</P>

<P>The final event for MIT was the 800. Just as Sean Montgomery was
getting ready for his final check-in, thirty minutes prior to his
event, the rain and lightening came in, causing a meet delay. Thirty
five minutes later they called for the athletes to return. The delay
was not an obstacle for Sean who is experienced in these meets and
handles problems well. The wind was blowing hard but that did not
prevent the runners from taking the pace out fast. Sean worked his
way up through the group, coming through the quarter in 53.8 in 4th
place. Coming down the backstretch it looked like Sean was ready to
make a move but then he seemed to fatigue. Nevertheless, Sean held on
and worked the final curve, moving up on the leaders. In the final
straight, Sean passed the 3rd place runner and closed on 2nd place.
However, he ran out of track and settled for 3rd place in 1:51.98.
This gave MIT their 18 points and best finish since 1989.</P>
