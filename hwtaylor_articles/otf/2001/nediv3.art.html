NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>May 5, 2001</P>

<P>MIT, seeded 28 points behind Wheaton College and 87 behind
Williams College, had an incredible display of team track and field
as they placed second to Williams 143.5 to 105. On a mostly sunny,
but very windy day, the Engineers had nine personal bests and four
more season bests as they scored 38 points more than they were
seeded.</P>

<P>Things started going Tech's way with the first event on Saturday,
the 10K. Ed Keehr, seeded second battled for 6 miles with the favored
runner from Keene State, dropping him with 400 to go, running a 66
last quarter to win by nearly 6 seconds in a personal best of
32:01.93. Frank Johnston, seeded 18th, having recovered from his bout
of Salmonella last week, showed what he is capable of when he placed
8th in 33:10.99.</P>

<P>The next event, the Hammer, brought another freshman record for
Chris Khan. Chris, already owning the freshman record in the Discus,
threw 169-6 to place 6th, and take the record away from John
Wallberg. Chris qualified provisionally for the NCAA Championships,
but he is only ranked 23rd at this time and will need to improve to
make it to Nationals.</P>

<P>The Long Jump was just not to be a good event for MIT this year.
Even though Tech had 3 jumpers over 21' and three more over 20', they
could not put together a jump to place in these Championships. Craig
Mielcarz set a season best of 21-1 1/2, but that was only good enough
for 10th. The only good news for MIT was that Wheaton was seeded
1-2-3 going into the event and was only able to pull out a first and
third.</P>

<P>Craig did come through big in the High Jump, clearing 6-9 on his
first attempt to place 2nd. Craig had a good first attempt at 6-11
but it was not quite there. Rick Rajter cleared 6-1 1/2 to place 7th.
It would have taken a leap of 6-5 to place any higher. Craig
qualified provisionally for the NCAA Championship with his
effort.</P>

<P>The Pole Vault was also being contested at this time. All three
MIT vaulters placed in the team's best event. Sam Thibault was the
most successful at battling the inconsistent cross wind as he won the
event with a vault of 14-3 1/4. Dan Opila set a season best of 13-11
1/4 as he placed 3rd. Dan Kwon tied for 5th with 13-3, bringing MIT's
point total in the event to 19.</P>

<P>At this point in the meet, MIT had scored 43 points but Wheaton
had amassed 34 points to keep pace. Both teams had successful
preliminary rounds on the track but Wheaton had much more scoring
potential in the these races. Wheaton had 3 in the finals of the 100,
2 in the 200, and 1 in the 400 coming out of the trials. MIT had
qualified Rick Rajter in the 110HH, Marc Washington in the 200, and
Tony Pelosi in the 400IH in the early round.</P>

<P>During the break in the running action, Chris Khan went to work
again, this time in the Discus. Chris spotted the field about 15' in
the trials but unloaded a throw of 152-11 to tie his freshman record
and win the event by 4'. Chris is hoping to qualify for nationals in
the next two weeks.</P>

<P>The Triple Jump was a hotly contested event. Wheaton was seeded
1-3-6 going in, and Kalpak Kothari of MIT was seeded 5th. Wheaton
only finished 1-6 to help Tech's cause and Kalpak unloaded a 46-6 3/4
jump on his last attempt to move up to 4th place. What was supposed
to be a 19-4 scoring difference turned out to be 13-5, a 7 point
swing. Kalpak joined the MIT ranks of national provisional qualifiers
with his jump.</P>

<P>The first running event on the track after the trials was the 3000
Steeplechase. Craig Wildman made a valiant effort at trying to score
but the ambitious effort left him in severe oxygen debt at the end as
he faded to 11th. Williams College showed their dominance in this
event by placing 1-2-5-7 to score 24 points.</P>

<P>Next, the 400 Relay was supposed to be a battle between Wheaton
and Williams and that is exactly what happened until the final leg
when Bates College split the teams up. Wheaton pulled out the victory
with a 42.17 effort. Bates College ran very well to finish 2nd and
take a couple of points away from Williams. MIT did not enter a team
due to their low seed and the fragile state of Rick Rajter, who would
do well to hold together for the meet without the 4x100. The score
was now MIT 58, Wheaton 57.</P>

<P>The 1500 had Brian Anderson from MIT seeded 5th. What the rest of
the field did not know was that Brian was ready to run fast. Mark
Miller, the defending indoor national champion from Keene State took
the pace out despite the wind in 61 for the first 400. Brian went
with him hoping he would be able to hang on and use his 800 speed to
surprise Miller at the end if the pace slowed a little. The 800 split
was 2:05 and the 1200 3:08. Miller began to pull away at this point
as Brian slowed a bit. Coming into the final straight, runners from
Trinity and Williams made a desperate attempt to catch Brian but came
a little short as all three ran 3:55. Brian's second place time of
3:55.65 provisionally qualifies him for nationals.</P>

<P>The 110HH was next and Rick Rajter was ready. Rick has run faster
in each race this season. In the trials he set another PR of 15.16,
the second fastest time in the trials. Rick was only seeded 6th so it
was looking like more good news for MIT. True to form, Rick set
another PR in the finals, this time breaking 15 seconds with a 14.88
for second place. With a slow start and reaching for the finish, Rick
has plenty of room for more personal bests. Rick's time not only
moves him into the top 10 at MIT, but all the way to #6 all time.
Rick's time also provisionally qualifies him for nationals.</P>

<P>MIT was on a roll, but they had to take a break and watch as the
next two events did not have a Tech entry. Wheaton however was seeded
to score 28 points in the two events. In the 100, things went pretty
much as predicted. Stanley Egbor of Worcester State showed why he is
one of the top sprinters in the country with his 10.48 victory.
Wheaton did not quite get what the were seeded to score, but
nevertheless racked up 15 points.</P>

<P>New England Division III track and field has improved a lot in the
last 5 years and the 400 race was a good example. It took a 49.77 to
make the finals on this day despite the wind. In the finals, Erik
Zwick of Bates beat the favored freshman from Wheaton with a 48.57
victory. The 23 points for Wheaton in the two events brought the
score to Wheaton 80, MIT 74.</P>

<P>Next on the track was the 800. Sean Montgomery of MIT was seeded
first and he did not disappoint. Sean let the field do the work as he
moved up during the first 400. The slow first quarter pace of 57 did
not help Sean in his bid for a better national qualifying
performance, but it did not affect the outcome. Sean held back
against the wind on the backstretch but opened up in the final 200 to
bring it home in 1:53.40 for first place.</P>

<P>Tony Pelosi , seeded 13th going into the trials of the 400IH, ran
a 56.06 to win his heat and get himself lane 5 in the finals. In the
final, Tony had to reach for the first hurdle but held 15 steps
throughout 6 hurdles despite running into the wind. Coming home Tony
looked strong, finishing 5th in 56.00. Again Williams showed their
depth by placing 1-2-3 to score 24 points. Freshman Adrian Townsend
served notice he would be back as he ran his race in 57.92 in the
trials, missing the finals by 1 position.</P>

<P>The score was now 88 for MIT and 80 for Wheaton. The 200, a strong
event for Wheaton was next. Marc Washington of MIT ran a 22.32 PR in
the trials to make it into the finals. In the final, Egbor again
dominated, running 20.94 for the win. Wheaton dropped the ball, and
their chance to catch MIT, by only earning 10 points. Washington
placed 6th to give MIT 3 more points and 91 total.</P>

<P>Sean Nolan was Tech's lone warrior in the 5000. Moving up through
the field cautiously during the first mile and a half due to the
ambitious pace, Sean nevertheless came through 2 miles in 9:32. By
this point Sean had moved up to 5th place and was in position to move
into 4th when his gas began to run out. The final mile was very
challenging for Nolan who managed to summon a 33 final 200 to hold
off the closing field. Sean's 15:10.7 was not his best time, but it
was a great effort that was worthy of 5th place.</P>

<P>The final race, the 4x400 relay, was seeded to be very
competitive. The top 8 teams had run between 3:18.10 and 3:23.95. MIT
was seeded 6th with their time of 3:22.34. Pride was at stake for MIT
who had won this race the last three championships (twice indoor and
last year outdoor). Despite losing Brian Hoying earlier in the season
to an injury in the groin area, and Matt Lehman to a hamstring injury
last week, the Engineers refused to accept the underdog role. Rick
Rajter stepped up to run the 400 for the first time despite being
exhausted from the heat and his earlier races. Rick's leadoff leg of
50.4 put Tech in the lead. Yuval Mazor, normally MIT's fastest leg,
moved up a leg to guarantee MIT would not have to move out of lane 1
on the exchanges. This would save MIT some time that they anticipated
needing given the alternate legs they were using. Yuval ran a 49.4
leg to open up the lead to about 5 meters over Springfield. Todd
Rosenfield, brought along as an alternate because he has not been
able to return to his performance level of last year after the bout
with mono in the winter, went out hard and never gave up. Todd held
on strong in the final straight to run 50.6 and give Sean Montgomery
a 1/2 step lead over the anchor leg from Springfield who had placed
5th earlier in the open 400. The Springfield runner took the lead on
the first turn, which was probably the best thing he could do to help
MIT. Sean does not tend to push the first 200 if he is in the lead,
but he can run with just about anyone from New England if he is
trailing. Sean trailed until the final straight when he pulled
alongside and finally past Springfield in the final 10 meters. Sean
ran a 48.4 anchor for a winning time of 3:19.07.</P>

<P>Coach Halston Taylor feels this effort by his team was the best
such championship effort he had witnessed by an MIT team since 1989.
"Even though we finished 38 1/2 points behind Williams, the losses we
faced this year due to injuries (two All-Americans, two national
qualifiers and one Division III runner-up), people who quit and those
who elected to do something other than outdoor track (one national
qualifier and a freshman record holder), combined with the fact that
the team had to split up and practice in three different venues while
the outdoor track is being resurfaced, this group of guys stepped up
and got the job done. I am very proud of this team."</P>

<P>Next week the Men's team will be at UConn to compete in the All
Division New England Championship.</P>
