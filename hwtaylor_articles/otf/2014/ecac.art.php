              <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">MIT Track &amp; Field Shines in ECAC Division III Championship - Send 18 to NCAA Division III Championship</span></p>
              <p align="left">May 15-16, 2014</p>
              <p align="left">In the final meet heading into the NCAA Division III Championship, the MIT Track &amp; Field team competed in the <a href="ecac.res.php">ECAC Division III Championship</a> hosted by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Although officially a championship, the meet is essentially a last chance qualifier as most colleges are in exams, getting ready for them, or just finished taking them. For Tech, the objective was simply to compete to win the events in which they were entered, and hope that would be enough to qualify for Nationals.</p>
              <p align="left">On the first day MIT took advantage of the opportunities put before them. Jackie Brew '14, not only had the fastest time in the 100HH trials, but moved up to a tie for sixth on the NCAA list with a 14.17 performance. Jackie Konopka '14, not having the best start and hitting the first hurdle, rallied nicely to run a personal best of 14.70 to also qualify for finals.</p>
              <p align="left">Cimmy Virdi '16 returned to the site of her 13-3 1/2 early season vault and discovered there was some magic still there. After an hour break due to rain, Virdi came out and cleared 13-1 1/2 to win the event and then had excellent jumps at 13-5. Abby Klein '14 cleared 11-7 3/4 to earn fourth place. Klein narrowly missed 12-1, which would have secured a spot to Nationals.  Both Jen Tylock '17 and Joanna Chen '15 cleared 11-2. Virdi enters the National Championship as the indoor national champion, but seeded second at this championship.</p>
              <p align="left">Tilly Taylor '15 was hoping to improve her mark in the Javelin Throw as she was concerned about falling out of the top 22, which is what it would take for anyone in the women's field to get to the NCAA Division III Championship. Currently ranked 17, she did not improve her mark, though she did place fifth at 130-3.</p>
              <p align="left">Ellen Liverpool '15 gave it one last try for Nationals, placing eighth with a throw of 154-10. She was not able to move up in the finals as it began to rain, making the circle very slippery.</p>
              <p align="left">At the end of the night the distance races were slated. The Engineers were resting Martina de Geus, Maryann Gong and Elaine McVay as they has already qualified for Nationals. Nicole Zeinstra '16 wanted to end her year on a high note so she could use it as a springboard into next year. She succeeded nicely, placing third in 17:52.41 in the 5K. She produced a 38 final 200, showing the 86-87 400 pace she ran for most of the race was too slow for her ability.</p>
              <p align="left">Kaitlin Allen '14 was up next in the 10K. She was gapped immediately as the leader went out in 82 and did not back off much in the early laps. Only three runners were in the lead pack and Allen was with the chase group, who settled into 88 pace for the first mile, then 89 pace for the next three miles. After four miles, when the pace slowed further to 90 seconds per 400, Allen moved ahead and started closing ground on third place, who she passed with about a mile to go. Trying to break 37:00, Allen closed in 83, but missed her goal by .62, running 37:00.62.</p>
              <p align="left">Day two was supposed to bring a lot of rain and heavy winds. The rain did not show until the meet was over, but the wind certainly made its presence known. Gusting in the 30+ mph range and lifting tents up like pieces of paper, the oval runners had little to no chance of improving their national ranking. However, the horizontal jumps, sprints and hurdles were a different story.  The maximum allowable wind for a national qualifying performance in the horizontal jumps and sprints was 4.0 meters per second, and many jumps and races exceeded that maximum, but most were in the 2.0-3.0 range.</p>
              <p align="left">Things began with the field events and Isabella Stuopis '16 was up in the Shot Put. Having competed in the Indoor NCAA Division III Championship, Stuopis was hoping to throw in the 44 foot range to return to the big meet. She threw well, hitting her best on her sixth and final throw, but it was still only 43-2 1/2, good for fourth place.</p>
              <p align="left">Ken Cooper '15, forced to miss the Hammer Throw the day before due to an academic presentation, was there ready to take his turn at putting the shot. He threw his best mark of the season, which he needed in order to compete at Naitonals. His 54-7 1/4 victory moved him into 11th on the ranking list. Cooper was not done either. He came from behind in his next event, the Discus, to win with a toss of 161-8 on his final throw.</p>
              <p align="left">Jackie Vahey '17 ended her season with yet another MIT and freshman record. On her final throw, she threw the discus 140-3 to place third in the competition, but just missed going to Nationals by two feet and one inch.</p>
              <p align="left">On the track, in the 100HH final, Konopka had a much better start, moving up to place second in a new personal best of 14.49. Brew finished in third in 14.56. Konopka moved up to 19th on the NCAA list, making the National Championship.</p>
              <p align="left">Although they were making no effort to win the competition from a team perspective, despite not running most of the middle-distance and distance runners, the women won the meet with 56 points.</p>
              <p align="left">The men had a few individuals trying to improve their national ranking on the track, but unfortunately with the exception of the 200 meter dash, they were all oval events. The men's 4x100 relay, dealing with injuries most of the year, but having run 41.93 the week before, did not have a chance in the strong wind. Michael DuPlessis '14 stepped out of his lane in a misstep to lose some time and then missed Nick Diamantoni's hand at the exchange to lose even more. Diamantoni, tending to run a bit hunched over to start with, really bent forward to try to make some headway into the wind. This technique did not work so well. States Lee '16 and Tyler Singer-Clark '14 competed well but could not make up the ground needed to run close to what they needed. They ended up placing seventh in 42.83.</p>
              <p align="left">Justin Bullock '14 wanted to give the 1500 one last try. The pace was adequate at the 400 in 63, but slowed too much in the second quarter to give anyone a real shot at the necessary 3:50 time. Bullock closed well, finishing in fourth in 3:58.85 to end his MIT career.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 800, Harrison Hunter '15 and Sam Parker '15 both wanted to improve their national rank. Hunter was ranked  18th in 1:51.64 while Parker was ranked 39th at 1:52.46. Only taking the top 20 to the NCAA Championship, and knowing there were a few other meets going on around the country, there was concern the pace would not be fast enough in the high winds. The pace was actually perfect at the 400 mark with a split of 54. Hunter started to move around the pack and then with 200 meters to go seemed to just give up the quest. Parker started his kick and with about 140 to go came up to his teammate. This seemed to wake Harrison up as he began to sprint and pull away from Parker. Hunter just missed taking the victory, placing third in 1:52.51. Parker faded in the final 100, but held on for eighth in 1:53.79. Hunter's lack of focus cost him the race, but his ranking held up, giving him another opportunity at the NCAA Championship.</p>
              <p align="left">Having already qualified with a fourth place ranking in the 400 with 47.52, States Lee was just running the 200. Although he stood up at the start, he finished well, placing sixth in a personal best of 21.82.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT is sending 18 student-athletes to the NCAA Division III Championship from May 22-24 at Ohio Wesleyan University with the hopes of exceeding their seed in each event and breaking into the top ten teams. Competing for MIT, and their ranking, are:</p>
