              <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px">Both Men and Women Retain NEWMAC Titles</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Cooper, Gong, Lee Earn Awards</span></span></p>
              <p align="left">April 26, 2014</p>
              <p align="left">The MIT Track &amp; Field team rolled onto the campus of host Mt. Holyoke College with the intent of continuing the streak of <a href="newmac.res.php">NEWMAC Outdoor Track &amp; Field</a> titles, competing at a championship level and not sustaining any more injuries. With the exception of a couple of event areas in which the competitiveness just was not there, all goals were accomplished.</p>
              <p align="left">The weather posed an obstacle early on as temperatures in the mid 40's combined with rain to make things very uncomfortable in the jumps and throws. About half-way through the meet, the sun came through and the temperature approached mid 50's to make for a much more cooperative environment for track and field performances.</p>
              <p align="left">The women were seeded to win their sixth consecutive NEWMAC title, so despite pulling Kendra Knittel '17, seeded second in the 400  and a key leg of the 4x100 Relay, due to a hamstring tightness, and taking Jackie Konopka '14 out of the High Jump when that event was moved to Smith College due to the rain, they were not deterred.</p>
              <p align="left">Despite the confidence, or possibly due to over confidence, the meet did not start as expected. On the track the 10K was a disappointment as MIT was only able to claim two points. Shivani Kaushal '15 came through with a seventh place 40:07.30. At the same time, an expected 13 points in the Triple Jump turned into eight as the jumpers just did not seem to take the competition seriously. In the Javelin, an expected win turned into a dismal second place. To top things off, pulling Knittle out of the meet meant no 4x100 Relay, an event where Tech was seeded second.</p>
              <p align="left">All of this could have derailed the Engineers, but fortunately, the women righted the ship. In the Pole Vault, Cimmy Virdi '16 won with a vault of 12-7 1/2 and was supported by a second and third from Abby Klein '14 and Jenn Tylock '17 at 11-5 3/4 and a fifth from Joanna Chen '15 at 10-6. The 28 points went a long way to curing what was ailing the Engineer's. At the same time, Isabella Stuopis '16 won the Shot Put with a throw of 40-6 1/4. Although Jackie Vahey '17 did not finish second where she was seeded, she did finish third at 35-5 1/4. However, Christine Labaza '14, not seeded to score, came through with a fifth place 34-10 1/4.</p>
              <p align="left">Back on the track, after Martina de Geus '14 came through with a second place 11:01.55 performance in the 3000 Steeplechase, Maryann Gong '17 ran an excellent 4:38.15 despite an opening 400 in 78 seconds to win the 1500. MIT did not support with additional points the way they should have as both Alexandra Taylor '14 and Christina Wicker '17 are battling injuries, but Louise van den Heuvel '14 did finish fourth in 4:45.19. </p>
              <p align="left">Konopka and Jackie Brew '14 came through in the 100HH to earn their seeds of second and third respectively. Konopka ran a season best 14.98 and Brew finished in 15.28 due in part to her injured achilles tendon.</p>
              <p align="left">Alexandra Shade '17 dropped down to the 400 to score some points for the Engineers and even though unseeded, she placed fourth in a best of 60.83.</p>
              <p align="left">Veronica Szklarzewski '15 rose to the occasion in the 100 meter dash. She was seeded fifth, but tied for second in a season best 11.52.</p>
              <p align="left">Over in the Hammer Throw, Ashley Weaver '15 and Ellen Liverpool '15 were battling it out for first place. Both threw PR's, but Weaver prevailed, throwing 157-0 to Liverpool's 154-10. Stuopis supported with a 136-4 PR for sixth place and Vahey earned seventh at 136-1.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 800, Gong did not win, but she ran a 2:16.74 second place to earn the votes necessary to win the NEWMAC Female Track Rookie of the meet.  Cindy Huang '15 added a fourth place and van den Heuvel a sixth.</p>
              <p align="left">Vahey added more points to the cause when she won the Discus at 128-2. Labaza added a third (120-1), Stuopis a fourth (112-10) and Wheeler a seventh (101-0).</p>
              <p align="left">In the 5K, Elaine McVay '15 needed to qualify for next week's championship and both Kaitlin Allen '14 and Nicole Zeinstra '16 wanted to improve their performances and place high. the pace was solid at 84 seconds per 400 as they hit 1600 splits of 5:37, 5:38 and 5:37. Both McVay and Allen let Danielle Opatovsky go at the end, but both accomplished their goal with McVay finishing second in 17:33.56 and Allen placing third in a PR of 17:33.93. Zeinstra faded at the end but ran a season best of 18:08.42 for sixth place.</p>
              <p align="left">In the final event, the 4x400 Relay, the quartet of Shade, Wicker, Huang and Gong put together an amazing come from behind race to apparently win in 3:59. However, the unit was disqualified when Wicker cut across the track after handing off, interfering with the other runners. Shade ran 59.1 as leadoff, Wicker 60.9 despite her knee ailments, Huang a 59.6 and Gong a serious come from behind 60.4.</p>
              <p align="left">Despite the disqualification, the women pulled away to win comfortably with 224.33 points. Second place went to Wheaton College with 149.33, WPI was third with 100.83, Coast Guard fourth at 74.5, Springfield fifth with 70, Wellesley sixth with 63, Smith with 43, Mt. Holyoke eighth with 27 and Babson ninth with 23 points.</p>
              <p align="left">Going into the competition, the men expected to win their 14th consecutive NEWMAC title, having only lost the 2000 championship. However, Michael Kaba '16 (110HH, 400IH, 4x100) had to be pulled from the competition due to a muscle tightness that appeared the day before. Nick Diamantoni '15 (400, 200, 4x100) was pulled from competition after the 4x100 due to his hamstring feeling tight. With the Pole Vault and High Jump being moved indoors to the campus of Smith College, Adrian Samsel '16 had to be pulled from the High Jump. Jordan Mizerak '14 was not yet ready to return to competition in the Pole Vault as his hamstring has not yet healed enough for him to bring enough speed to his approach. This combination did not give the Engineers much leeway in securing a victory--everyone was going to have to step up.</p>
              <p align="left">The meet did not start off well for Tech. In addition to the injury status of the team, Wesley DeChristofaro of WPI, the only team with the potential to upset MIT, passed Carrington Motley '16 and Adrian Samsel '16 on the final attempt to knock them back to third and fourth in the Long Jump competition. Simultaneously, Alex Noakes '16, seeded fourth in the Hammer, placed sixth at 143-4. Despite Ken Cooper's '15 victory MIT lost six points (nine point swing) in the first two events.  Fortunately, on the track Matt McEachern '17 turned on the burners at the end of the 10K to move up from his sixth seed to place third in 32:27.37, supporting Brian Gilligan's '17 fifth place effort in 32:31.93, both personal bests.</p>
              <p align="left">While some of it was due to injury, overall the field events did not come through for MIT. Seeded to earn 138 points, only 89.5 were actually awarded. Perhaps the biggest letdown was in the Shot Put where Cooper and Noakes both fouled out after being seeded first and fourth respectively. The only field event that earned its keep was the Triple Jump where Angel Echevarria '16 and Motley went first and second with Echevarria winning in 45-9.</p>
              <p align="left">On the plus side for Tech's field events, Cooper threw a 165-11 in the Discus to win and move up to number two on the all-time MIT list and number seven on this year's NCAA Division III ranking. The combination of this and winning the Hammer Throw earned Cooper the NEWMAC Male Field Event Performer of the Meet. Also in the field events, Ian Perry '17 added to the Pole Vault points, earning fifth to join Ben Schreck '15 (2nd), and Marshall Wentworth '16 (6th) in scoring and in qualifying for the New England Division III Championship.</p>
              <p align="left">Fortunately, despite the loss of Kaba and Diamantoni, the running events scored only one less point than they were seeded. The only events affected on the negative side were those where the two injured runners would have competed.  To counter, the return of Tyler Singer-Clark '14 proved very big for MIT. The sprinter was held out of both relays, but he managed to qualify for the New England Division III Championship in both the 100 and 200 while scoring in both; earning third in the 100 in 11.23 and fourth in the 200 in 22.67.</p>
              <p align="left">States Lee '16 was the star for Tech, winning the 200 (22.22) and 400 (48.58) as well as running key legs on the winning 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams. For his efforts the sophomore was co-winner of the NEWMAC Male Track Athlete of the meet. </p>
              <p align="left">Although behind WPI in scoring at that point in the meet, the 800 was a big event for MIT, pushing MIT into the lead. Harrison Hunter '15 and Sam Parker '15 finished 1-2 in 1:54.56 and 1:54.78 respectively. Rick Paez '15 pulled in four more points with a PR of 1:57.58.</p>
              <p align="left">Justin Bullock '14 won the 1500 after taking the pace out hard (61 first 400), relinquishing the lead and appearing to give up, only to come back and sprint past the leaders on the final backstretch to pull away in 3:56.40.  Matt Deyo '16 ran a seven second PR with his 3:59.88 fifth place finish.</p>
              <p align="left">Rory Beyer '17 pulled away in the final 600 meters to win the 3000 Steeplechase in a personal best of 9:34.90.  Kris Frey '15 supported with a PR of his own, placing fourth in 10:00.71.</p>
              <p align="left">The 400IH did not net a victory, but Samsel run a personal best 54.70 to place second, just edging out the second place at the line by .01. Gary Burnett '17 added a sixth place in 57.54, a season best.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 5K, not only did MIT need points, but Matt Jordan '15, Allen Leung '15 and Benji Xie '15 all still needed to qualify for next week's New England Division III Championship. They were in a difficult position because it was decided that if the number one seed, Gary Ezzo of Coast Guard, pushed the pace, they would not try to beat him, saving energy for next week's competition. Yet, they still needed to run sub 15:25 as well as score enough points to secure the victory. Fortunately, WPI had no serious scoring threats to worry about.  Roy Wedge '14, already qualified for next week's championship, was there to help his teammates and score some points if he did not have to work too hard. In the end everything worked out as Jordan placed second in 15:12.38, Leung earned third in 15:13.81 and Xie placed fifth to qualify for next week's championship. In addition, Wedge was sixth in 15:29.21.</p>
              <p align="left">In the final event, the 4x400 Relay, MIT needed to secure a spot in the fast section of the 4x400 next weekend, and of course wanted a victory here. Pulling Hunter and Parker down from the 800 and adding Lee and Derek Barnes '16, who had earlier placed third in the 400 in 49.85 and eighth in the 200 in 22.91, the result was a 3:17.82 victory. MIT finished with 250.5 points to 212 for WPI, 147 for Coast Guard, 88.5 for Springfield, 53 for Wheaton and 20 for Babson.</p>
              <p align="left">Next week, the men hope to piggyback on their New England Division III Indoor Track &amp; Field victory and earn another title. The women hope to defend last year's title, but will certainly not be favored over a strong Williams College team.</p>
