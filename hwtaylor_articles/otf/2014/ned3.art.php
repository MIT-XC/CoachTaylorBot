              <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px">MIT Men and Women Run Away With New England Division III Titles</span></p>
              <p align="left">May 1-3, 2014</p>
              <p align="left">The MIT Track &amp; Field men's and women's teams traveled to Springfield College this weekend as favorites to win the <a href="ned3.res.php">New England Division III Championship</a>. Despite a season full of injuries to long sprinters the men were heavy favorites. The women, going through a trying season of injuries as well, were very slight favorites over the very talented and competitive Williams College team.</p>
              <p align="left">With Spring finally breaking in New England, providing 60+ degree temperatures, Adrian Samsel '16 started things off with the two day Decathlon. Seeded second, Samsel does what he does best, set PR after PR. He started with an 11.23 100 and then added a 21-11 long jump, both personal bests. He then performed more normally in the Shot with a 36-0 3/4 effort and only managed a 5-11 1/4 High Jump. He saved the best for last as his fifth event, and last of day one was a 49.73 400 for his third PR of the day. Day two was more of the same as he began with a 15.27 in the 110HH, a 94-3 in the Discus, a huge 12-3 1/2 in the Pole Vault, and a 115-8 in the Javelin. With one event to go, Samsel trailed for the first time in the competition, just 22 points short of first. The 1500 is a solid event for Samsel and he delivered a 4:31.40 to win by over 200 points and a total of 6472 points to put himself eleventh on the NCAA list. Every event on day two was a new personal best.</p>
              <p align="left">Between the Decathlon Pole Vault and Javelin Throw, the Men's Long Jump was going on. Timing worked out well and Samsel was able to squeeze in all three trials efforts, popping a 22-6 1/2 PR, good for fifth place overall. Teammate Carrington Motley '16 did one centimeter better for a 22-7 performance, placing fourth. </p>
              <p align="left">The Hammer was going on at the same time and Ken Cooper '15 was taking care of business. Cooper placed second with a throw of 185-7, just missing first place. Cooper had a nice series of throws, showing he is ready for a big throw in the near future.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event of day two for the men was the 10K. Tech had seven entries in the event, hoping to score major points. The weather was perfect and Gary Ezzo of Coast Guard blasted off at the gun, intending to run away with the event and take advantage of the weather. His first quarter was 70 seconds, but the MIT squad was ready for the move and maintained contact between 71-73 seconds. He quickly realized he was not going to run away with it that easily and the pace settled into 75 second quarters. At the 1600 mark, Benji Xie '15 and Allen Leung '15 were right on Ezzo's tail at 4:53. Roy Wedge '14 and Matt Jordan '15 were at 4:55. Brian Gilligan '17, Matt Deyo '16 and Matt McEachern '17 had fallen off the extremely fast pace, but were still under 5:00. The second mile was 4:56 and the third a 4:58 for a 14:48, but Leung fell off the pace, coming through in 4:56. Now the lead group was just four and stayed that way through five miles when Jordan fell off the lead group as they leaders hit 24:49. With 500 meters to go, Wedge took off, burying the final 400 in 62 seconds to win in a huge PR of 30:50.06. Xie fell off the pace with two laps to go, but held on for third in 31:05.70. Jordan also held on, placing fourth in a PR of 31:16.88. Leung faded, but held onto seventh, just missing sixth in 32:08.57. The 23 points in the 10K gave the Engineers 50 points going into the final day of competition, 30 points up on the field.</p>
              <p align="left">The women had an equally great start. Not entering anyone in the Heptathlon, MIT's first competitor was Tilly Taylor '15 in the Javelin. Taylor took the lead on her fifth throw, a 137-5 effort. However, on the final throw of the event, she was passed, settling for second place, two places higher than she was seeded.</p>
              <p align="left">At the same time, the Long Jump was taking place. Jackie Konopka '14, seeded well out of the scoring, popped a great jump to make finals and then jumped a PR 17-5 1/2 to place fifth. Veronica Szklarzewski '15 missed finals by one centimeter, not getting credit for a great third attempt that was questionably called a foul.</p>
              <p align="left">As the women's 10K was kicking off, the women's hammer was well under way. Ashley Wheeler '15 and Ellen Liverpool '15, seeded 6th and 7th going into the competition, performed well. Liverpool had a solid first throw, which had her in seventh going into finals. Wheeler had an excellent series, but just squeaked into finals in ninth position. On her second throw of finals, Wheeler threw 154-7 to move into sixth, pushing Liverpool back to eighth. Jackie Vahey '17 did not place but improved her own freshmen record to 146-8. Isabella Stuopis '16 also set a PR, throwing 145-1.</p>
              <p align="left">The women ended Friday night with the 10K. Unlike their male counterparts, the women only had two entries representing MIT, but they were the right two, Elaine McVay '15 and Kaitlin Allen '14. The plan was to go with the leader if someone were to take it out at a pace that would yield a sub 37:00 time, and if not, to set an 89 second quarter pace to hit the 37:00 mark, a time figured to net first and second place. Sure enough, no one wanted to establish a fast pace. McVay and Allen took over pacing duties 300 meters into the race, hitting the first 400 in 92 and no one going with them. As they picked up the pace to 89, one runner joined them, but that was short lived. The pair rattled off 1600 splits of 5:53, 5:54, 5:54, 5:56, 5:59, and 6:00 before closing out with an 84 second quarter to put McVay in first in 37:00.36 and Allen in second in 37:00.54, a new PR. The women ended day one with a fantastic 34 points.</p>
              <p align="left">The final day of competition began very well as the attitude of the MIT athletes was simply relentless. They refused to fall down and the support was incredible, event to event. Cooper was back in action, this time winning the Discus with a 164-7 performance. At the same time, Motley put together a 46-11 1/2 Triple Jump performance to place third. Teammate, Angel Echevarria '16 placed fourth with a personal best 46-10 1/4 jump.</p>
              <p align="left">On the track, Rory Beyer '17 continued his weekly improvement in the 3000 Steeplechase. Seeded ninth, Beyer knew he would have to establish himself amongst the leaders or the pace would get away from him, making it very difficult to catch up at the end. The pace was fast, too fast for Beyer, but he settled into sixth place, gradually working his way up in the field. The 1600 pace was 4:57, quite a bit faster than he had ever done. He ran his slowest quarter of 79 at that point and then started to move, running back to back 78's as the field was dying up front. He moved hard in the final 200, moving into third place with 80 meters to go when another runner kicked past him. Beyer surged again, just missing third by .2 seconds. Beyer ran his final 200 in 34 seconds, showing he has more left to improve.</p>
              <p align="left">The 4x100 Relay team was up next. Last year MIT placed fifth at nationals in this event, but with the injuries, resulting lack of practice time and having a different foursome every week, MIT was only seeded third going into this meet. Michael DuPlessis '14, at least .2 slower than the same time next year, was the leadoff runner. DuPlessis seemed to hold his own and the handoff to Nick Diamantoni '15, himself coming off a hamstring injury earlier in the season was solid. Diamantoni ran an excellent leg, actually running up on States Lee '16, which itself cost a lot of time. Lee, the only totally healthy member of the team, ran well, handing off to Tyler Singer-Clark, making his return to 4x100 duties. Singer-Clark showed some of his old speed, but not quite all of it, as he closed to second place in 42.48. Southern Maine ran a faster time in the section before to win overall and send MIT back to third place.</p>
              <p align="left">The next event on the track where MIT was seeded to score was the 400. Lee was seeded to win and Derek Barnes '16 was seeded seventh. Both were in the fast section. Lee went out very hard, probably pushing the first 200 too hard, but he is strong enough to do that and still win, which he did in 48.49. Barnes had a great run, finishing third in 49.09. At this point MIT was up over 50 points and had virtually won the meet. However, the men were driven and did not let up.</p>
              <p align="left">Cooper was up in the Shot Put, and while he did not have his best performance, he placed third with a throw of 49-5 3/4. After fouling out last week it was clear he was being cautious and holding back a bit.</p>
              <p align="left">At the same time, the men's Pole Vault was finally about to start after taking the time to move a better pit into position. Jordan Mizerak '14, a vaulter converted from the multi-events, had pulled his hamstring three weeks earlier. His dedication to the team and determination to compete at this meet has been phenomenal. He not only was able to compete, he cleared a personal best of 15-3 to earn fifth place, a nice four point bonus. Ben Schreck '15, also cleared 15-3, tying for second place based on fewer misses.</p>
              <p align="left">The 800 was up next, with Sam Parker '15 seeded first and Harrison Hunter '15 seeded seventh. The pace was quick, hitting the first 400 in 54 seconds. Parker was in great position and Hunter was in the back of the tight pack. With 300 to go, Hunter screamed down the backstretch, taking the lead with 200 to go. With 100 to go, Hunter lost the lead and looked as if he may start to fade. However, he fought back, again surging to the lead and winning in a personal best of 1:52.28, a time that moves him to 10th on the NCAA list. Parker ran a fine race but did not seem to have the fight in the final 100, even slowing before the finish line to fall from fourth to fifth in 1:53.91.</p>
              <p align="left">Without Michael Kaba '16, out with his own hamstring issues, in the 4x100, 4x400, 110HH and 400IH MIT was missing a lot of points. The best substitution in the 400IH was Samsel. Although he was fatigued from the Decathlon and Long Jump the past two days, he is extremely talented in this event. His start, normally very reliable, put him slightly off in his first three hurdles, preventing him from getting out with the leaders. He made a strong comeback in the final 200, moving up to fifth place in a personal best 54.66. Next week he will go after the event fresh to see what he can do.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 200, Lee, Singer-Clark and Barnes were back in business. Barnes, running in an earlier section due to his slow seed time, ran 22.48 to place 10th overall, just out of the scoring. Singer-Clark in the next to fastest section, ran 22.40 to tie for seventh place. Lee, having a horrible start out of the blocks, got behind early. He made up significant ground in the final 50 meters, moving from seventh to third in 22.02.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT was so far ahead at this point that they pulled three of their 5K runners, who were all seeded to score, as well as their top seeded 4x400 team. Two of the 5K runners wanted to race, Matt Jordan  and Matt Deyo, both having raced in the 10K the night before. The pace began slow, but then a lead group of four moved ahead, separating themselves from the group Jordan and Deyo ran with, settling with 73-74 second 400's through 11 laps. One of the runners fell off the lead group and both Jordan and Deyo picked him off as both accelerated to 72 and then 32 in the final 600 meters. Jordan placed fourth in 15:13.97 and Deyo ran 15:16.22 for fifth.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event for the MIT was the 4x800 Relay. This was an event MIT thought they could win even though Bowdoin College loaded up the event with excellent fresh runners. Henry Tareque '17 led off for MIT. He was cautious for the first time this year as he settled in for the second 200, coming through an uncharacteristically slow 58.2. He ran a 61 final 400 to split 1:59.8, putting MIT back in seventh place. Hunter got the baton, moving patiently through the field. His 55.4 first 400 put him at the front. He finished in 1:53.9 to give MIT a slight lead. Rick Paez '15 ran an excellent leg, hitting 55.3 for the first 400 to keep MIT in front. On his second 400 he lost the lead, but was only about 15-20 meters back in third place as he handed off to Parker with a 1:56.1 leg. Parker did not go after the leaders, instead seeming to settle for third place as he fell well behind with a very uninspired 57.5 first 400. He maintained his position in the final quarter, running 1:58.4 to give Tech third place in 7:48.48.</p>
              <p align="left">The final score had MIT 80 points up on the second place team, Bates College, 159.83 to 79.33. Bridgewater State was third of the 32 scoring teams with 67 points.</p>
              <p align="left">The final day for the women did not begin with the same level of success as the men, but the ladies never gave up. In the Shot Put, the women were seeded third and fourth with Stuopis and Vahey respectively. Stuopis threw her seed, placing third at 42-9 3/4. Vahey threw just 10 centimeters less than her best, but was only able to place ninth as many of the throwers threw personal bests.</p>
              <p align="left">In the Pole Vault, the Engineers were seeded first, fifth, sixth and eighth and were expecting their usually domination. Cimmy Virdi '16 did what she was supposed to do, placing first at 12-2 1/2. Although a couple of vaulters did not handle the pressure well, Abby Klein '14 seized the opportunity of a nice tailwind and excellent temperatures to clear a PR of 11-8 1/2, placing fourth.</p>
              <p align="left">On the track, Martina deGeus '14, seeded fifth, showed her comeback from ACL surgery last summer is complete. She ran conservatively in pace and on the barriers, but accelerated to an 85 quarter with 600 to go to move into second place and finished with a 38 final 200 to show she has a lot more in the tank. Her time of 10:45.76 moved her to number five on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 4x100, the seventh seeded quartet of Jackie Brew '14, Szklarzewski, Kendra Knittel '17 and Konopka had not raced together in five weeks and only practiced together once. The ladies ran fast, but the handoffs showed the lack of practice. Brew had trouble getting the baton to Szklarzewski and then she in turn was holding the baton such that not much was exposed and took too long to get it into Knittel's hand. Knittel missed Konopka the first time, causing Konopka to break slightly before receiving the baton. All this served to move them to fifth place in a season best 48.11, number 18 on the national list. With two more weeks to practice and improve the quartet hopes to move up on that list.</p>
              <p align="left">The jumps were not their usual strength for MIT, as they were seeded second in the High Jump, but failed to score. Natalie Alper '17 did jump a season best of 5-2 1/4. Michelle Johnson '15, seeded ninth in the Triple Jump, pulled out an eighth place at 36-1 1/2, although she was hoping for a much higher place.</p>
              <p align="left">Fortunately, the Engineers again found a way to rebound. Seeded only for third in the Discus, Vahey pulled out a second while Christine Labaza '14 stepped up big for a fourth place and Stuopis made up for what she thought she should have done in the Shot Put by getting a seventh place at 117-10 for a new PR.</p>
              <p align="left">Back on the track, number three seed Maryann Gong '17 was up in the 1500. Gong ran an excellent race, moving up with 300 meters to go, taking the lead with 200 to go and apparently sprinting away from the field when she suddenly put the brakes on with 50 meters to go thinking she had one more lap remaining. As she faded to third, crossing the line in 4:38.45 she realized her error. Too bad for Gong, but it will likely make for a great anecdote for years to come. Louise van den Heuvel '14, running out of the slow section, ran away with the section win, placing ninth overall in 4:47.79.</p>
              <p align="left">Having qualified out of the morning trials, Brew and Konopka were in the 100HH final. Seeded fifth and sixth, their goal was to split the Tufts runners seeded third and fourth as prior to the meet, it was presumed Tufts would also be a team contender for the title, based largely on the sprint and hurdle events. The results could not have been better. Running into a slight headwind, Brew ran a PR 14.56 to earn third place, beating both Tufts runners. Konopka also ran a PR, placing fifth in 14.72 to defeat one of the Tufts runners. Brew's time moves her to 16th on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p align="left">Not seeded to score, Szklarzewski qualified for the 100 Meter final. She not only made the final, she placed fifth in a personal best 12.47 for a needed four points. At this point, MIT was up on Williams by about 40 points and looking as though the victory was in the bag. Like the men, the women did not take the foot off the accelerator.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 800, MIT was seeded sixth and eighth. Cindy Huang '15 raised that bet, running a PR of 2:15.44 as she positioned herself well with a 68 first quarter, then worked down the backstretch to move up with the leaders. She finished in third to give Tech six more points.</p>
              <p align="left">Certain of the victory, MIT pulled McVay from the 5K and scratched the 4x400 relay, both of which would have scored very well. Running the 5K was a determined Gong, Allen and Nicole Zeinstra '16. The pace was pretty slow by Gong standards as the leaders ran 5:41 for the first 1600 and 5:42 for the second 1600. Allen, feeling good at the start, could feel the effects of the 10K as she made her way into the mid part of the race. Zeinstra got pulled off her race plan and started to panic early. Making sure she counted laps, Gong took off with 900 meters to go. Her next 800 was 2:36 and her final 200 a 38 as she pulled away to win by 12 seconds. in 17:27.26. Allen made a comeback, passing down the final straight, running 36 seconds for the final 200 to take sixth in 17:48.60.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 4x800, MIT had a solid quartet of Christina Wicker '17, Alexandra Shade '17, van den Heuvel and Huang. Wicker was unable to put MIT in front, fading in the final 300 meters after a 68 first 400. Her split of 2:23.2 had MIT back in the pack. Shade went out in 66.6 to bring MIT up to the front and then took the lead as she split 2:18.9. van den Heuvel only ran 2:22.3, but she kept MIT close, handing off in second place.  Huang went out hard, determined to make up the gap and put her team in position to win on the final lap. Her 66.5 did just that and then she capped it off with her second 2:15 of the day, bringing her team in first in 9:20.17.</p>
              <p align="left">The final point total had MIT with 132 points to 85 for Williams and 50 for third place Tufts out of the 33 scoring teams.</p>
              <p align="left">Now the Engineers will focus on the NCAA Division III Championship in three weeks and qualifying via the next two weeks of championships. Next week, MIT travels to Westfield State College, the host of the NEICAAA Championship, a meet that brings together all the Division I, II and III colleges in New England.</p>
