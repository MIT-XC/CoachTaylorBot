    MIT Remains Undefeated - Vahey Sets Varsity and Freshman Discus Records
    
    
                  
    
    April 12, 2014
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's Track & Field team traveled to Lewiston, ME, home of the Bates College Bobcats for a quadrangular meet on the men's side (Bates, Colby, MIT, Southern Maine) and a tri-meet on the women's side (Bates, Colby, MIT). The weather was by far the best thus far in the early spring of New England with near 70 degree temperatures and mostly sunny skies, although the wind was gusting to 30 mph much of the day, hurting all running events with the exception of the 100 Meter Dash.
    
    
                  
    
    Since the number of teams was different for both genders, the scoring system for the two meets differed as well. The men scored eight places with a format of 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 with relays scoring 9-7-6-5. The women only scored six places using 7-5-4-3-2-1 for individual events and 7-5-4 for the relays. Despite the large number of injuries on the men's side, as well as one critical one at the beginning of this meet, the men won with a score of 257.5 to 220 for Bates, 122.5 for Colby and 107 for Southern Maine. The women continued their unbeaten streak with 176.5 points to 129.5 for Bates and 110 for Colby.
    
    
                  
    
    As the men were warming up, testing their marks for the 4x100 Relay, Jordan Mizerak '14, an excellent pole vaulter and fill-in on the relay, sustained a hamstring pull while finishing a handoff. To add insult to injury, or actually injury to injury, Stephanie Birkhimer '14 rolled her ankle while preparing for the high jump and her leg on the 4x100 Relay.
    
    
                  
    
    Going into the meet with these additional injuries meant quick additions to the 4x100 and rethinking what would be needed to win the meet. MIT was favored to win, but it would be in jeopardy if the team did not perform to their abilities.
    
    
                  
    
    Fortunately, the teams raised their game. The men won four of the eight field events (gaining second place in three of the others as well as two of those where they also took first place). They also won six of the running events. The women were first in six of the eight field events as well as five of the running events. They also scored three of more of the six scoring places in eight events to dominate the meet.
    
    
                  
    
    Jackie Brew '14 was the dominant force for the women, winning three events (100, 100HH, 200) and setting personal bests in two of them; 12.48 in the 100 and 25.54 in the 200. Brew also ran a leg on the third place 4x100 Relay. 
    
    
                  
    
    There were many other event champions for MIT, but two standout above the others. Martina de Geus '14 made her return to competition after tearing her ACL at the NCAA Division III Championship last May in the 3000 Steeplechase. It took a lot of fortitude to race, and even more to go after the win. Each hurdle and water jump got better as the race progressed. Her winning time of 11:24.24 was far from her best, but a huge step forward.
    
    
                  
    
    The other was the final event of the meet, the women's Discus. Freshman Jackie Vahey launched her final throw 132-3 from the circle to win the event and set both the freshman and varsity record at MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    Overall, the women took 20 of the possible 48 places in the field events, most of them of the first and second place variety. Isabella Stuopis '17 continued to dominate the Shot Put, winning at 41-5 3/4. She also threw a personal best of 115-7 to place second in the Discus. Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 returned to her winning ways in the High Jump, clearing 5-2 1/4 for the victory. Cimmy Virdi '16 battled tremendous cross winds in the Pole Vault, winning with a vault of 12-0 3/4. Michelle Johnson '15 took first place honors in the Triple Jump at 36-4 1/4. Tilly Taylor '15 threw her season best in the Javelin Throw, a 133-10 performance, good for first place.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Elaine McVay '15 added to the winning performances by Brew and de Geus. Her 36:03.33 in the 10K was phenomenal given that she was by herself and having to deal with the very high winds. The mark currently has her number nine on the NCAA Division III rankings.
    
    
                  
    
    The men had no double winners this week. Even Ken Cooper '15 was unable to pull off his normal "hat trick". Cooper did win the Hammer with a throw of 178-3. He did place second in both the Shot Put and Discus with performances of 51-9 3/4 and 160-11 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    Also in the field events, Carrington Motley '16 took first place in the Triple Jump with a leap of 46-6 1/4, his best jump of the season. Motley also earned second place in the Long Jump with 21-8 3/4. John Thomas '15 came right off his 4x100 relay substitution to clear 6-0 3/4 to win the High Jump. Harry Rein '15 threw a personal best of 175-9 to win the Javelin in the strong cross-winds.
    
    
                  
    
    States Lee '16 had a great day on the track, taking second the 100 in a personal best of 11.07, winning the 200 in a personal best of 21.84, running a strong third leg of the 4x100 Relay to assist in the 43.10 victory, and gave MIT the lead for good in the 4x400 Relay, leading off in 49.0.
    
    
                  
    
    Adrian Samsel '16 had a busy day. In addition to winning the 400IH in 56.18, he also ran a PR in the 110HH, getting second place in 15.34. He also took third in the Long Jump at 21-0 1/2, second in the High Jump at 5-10 and anchored the winning 4x100 Relay.
    
    
                  
    
    Harrison Hunter '15 edged out teammate Sam Parker '15 in the 800, proving his hard work is paying off. Despite the high winds Hunter ran 1:55.36 to Parker's 1:55.55. Both also ran on the victorious 4x400 Relay, running 51.2 and 50.2 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    Joining the inspirational anecdotes for the day, Justin Bullock '14 returned to the track after his stress fracture on one leg and getting run over by a car on the other leg sidelined him for the championship portion of the indoor season and the first two weeks of the outdoor season. His start to finish victory in the 1500, braving the strong winds by himself and winning in 4:06.64 was very motivating for his teammates.
    
    
                  
    
    Benji Xie '15 teamed with Matt Jordan '15 to go 1-2 in the 10K. Both separated themselves from the pack after 800 meters and then Xie separated himself from Jordan in the final mile. Both were just running to qualify for the New England Division III Championship in three weeks. Xie won in 32:20.19 and Jordan ran 32:26.92.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT will take a handful of runners to Princeton for the Friday distance portion of the Larry Ellis Invitational. Adrian Samsel will compete in the Holy Cross Decathlon mid-week and the rest of the team will be at MIT's Sean Collier Invitational on the 19th.

    MIT Track & Field Shines in ECAC Division III Championship - Send 18 to NCAA Division III Championship
    
    
                  
    
    May 15-16, 2014
    
    
                  
    
    In the final meet heading into the NCAA Division III Championship, the MIT Track & Field team competed in the ECAC Division III Championship hosted by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Although officially a championship, the meet is essentially a last chance qualifier as most colleges are in exams, getting ready for them, or just finished taking them. For Tech, the objective was simply to compete to win the events in which they were entered, and hope that would be enough to qualify for Nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    On the first day MIT took advantage of the opportunities put before them. Jackie Brew '14, not only had the fastest time in the 100HH trials, but moved up to a tie for sixth on the NCAA list with a 14.17 performance. Jackie Konopka '14, not having the best start and hitting the first hurdle, rallied nicely to run a personal best of 14.70 to also qualify for finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Cimmy Virdi '16 returned to the site of her 13-3 1/2 early season vault and discovered there was some magic still there. After an hour break due to rain, Virdi came out and cleared 13-1 1/2 to win the event and then had excellent jumps at 13-5. Abby Klein '14 cleared 11-7 3/4 to earn fourth place. Klein narrowly missed 12-1, which would have secured a spot to Nationals.  Both Jen Tylock '17 and Joanna Chen '15 cleared 11-2. Virdi enters the National Championship as the indoor national champion, but seeded second at this championship.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor '15 was hoping to improve her mark in the Javelin Throw as she was concerned about falling out of the top 22, which is what it would take for anyone in the women's field to get to the NCAA Division III Championship. Currently ranked 17, she did not improve her mark, though she did place fifth at 130-3.
    
    
                  
    
    Ellen Liverpool '15 gave it one last try for Nationals, placing eighth with a throw of 154-10. She was not able to move up in the finals as it began to rain, making the circle very slippery.
    
    
                  
    
    At the end of the night the distance races were slated. The Engineers were resting Martina de Geus, Maryann Gong and Elaine McVay as they has already qualified for Nationals. Nicole Zeinstra '16 wanted to end her year on a high note so she could use it as a springboard into next year. She succeeded nicely, placing third in 17:52.41 in the 5K. She produced a 38 final 200, showing the 86-87 400 pace she ran for most of the race was too slow for her ability.
    
    
                  
    
    Kaitlin Allen '14 was up next in the 10K. She was gapped immediately as the leader went out in 82 and did not back off much in the early laps. Only three runners were in the lead pack and Allen was with the chase group, who settled into 88 pace for the first mile, then 89 pace for the next three miles. After four miles, when the pace slowed further to 90 seconds per 400, Allen moved ahead and started closing ground on third place, who she passed with about a mile to go. Trying to break 37:00, Allen closed in 83, but missed her goal by .62, running 37:00.62.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two was supposed to bring a lot of rain and heavy winds. The rain did not show until the meet was over, but the wind certainly made its presence known. Gusting in the 30+ mph range and lifting tents up like pieces of paper, the oval runners had little to no chance of improving their national ranking. However, the horizontal jumps, sprints and hurdles were a different story.  The maximum allowable wind for a national qualifying performance in the horizontal jumps and sprints was 4.0 meters per second, and many jumps and races exceeded that maximum, but most were in the 2.0-3.0 range.
    
    
                  
    
    Things began with the field events and Isabella Stuopis '16 was up in the Shot Put. Having competed in the Indoor NCAA Division III Championship, Stuopis was hoping to throw in the 44 foot range to return to the big meet. She threw well, hitting her best on her sixth and final throw, but it was still only 43-2 1/2, good for fourth place.
    
    
                  
    
    Ken Cooper '15, forced to miss the Hammer Throw the day before due to an academic presentation, was there ready to take his turn at putting the shot. He threw his best mark of the season, which he needed in order to compete at Naitonals. His 54-7 1/4 victory moved him into 11th on the ranking list. Cooper was not done either. He came from behind in his next event, the Discus, to win with a toss of 161-8 on his final throw.
    
    
                  
    
    Jackie Vahey '17 ended her season with yet another MIT and freshman record. On her final throw, she threw the discus 140-3 to place third in the competition, but just missed going to Nationals by two feet and one inch.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, in the 100HH final, Konopka had a much better start, moving up to place second in a new personal best of 14.49. Brew finished in third in 14.56. Konopka moved up to 19th on the NCAA list, making the National Championship.
    
    
                  
    
    Although they were making no effort to win the competition from a team perspective, despite not running most of the middle-distance and distance runners, the women won the meet with 56 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The men had a few individuals trying to improve their national ranking on the track, but unfortunately with the exception of the 200 meter dash, they were all oval events. The men's 4x100 relay, dealing with injuries most of the year, but having run 41.93 the week before, did not have a chance in the strong wind. Michael DuPlessis '14 stepped out of his lane in a misstep to lose some time and then missed Nick Diamantoni's hand at the exchange to lose even more. Diamantoni, tending to run a bit hunched over to start with, really bent forward to try to make some headway into the wind. This technique did not work so well. States Lee '16 and Tyler Singer-Clark '14 competed well but could not make up the ground needed to run close to what they needed. They ended up placing seventh in 42.83.
    
    
                  
    
    Justin Bullock '14 wanted to give the 1500 one last try. The pace was adequate at the 400 in 63, but slowed too much in the second quarter to give anyone a real shot at the necessary 3:50 time. Bullock closed well, finishing in fourth in 3:58.85 to end his MIT career.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 800, Harrison Hunter '15 and Sam Parker '15 both wanted to improve their national rank. Hunter was ranked  18th in 1:51.64 while Parker was ranked 39th at 1:52.46. Only taking the top 20 to the NCAA Championship, and knowing there were a few other meets going on around the country, there was concern the pace would not be fast enough in the high winds. The pace was actually perfect at the 400 mark with a split of 54. Hunter started to move around the pack and then with 200 meters to go seemed to just give up the quest. Parker started his kick and with about 140 to go came up to his teammate. This seemed to wake Harrison up as he began to sprint and pull away from Parker. Hunter just missed taking the victory, placing third in 1:52.51. Parker faded in the final 100, but held on for eighth in 1:53.79. Hunter's lack of focus cost him the race, but his ranking held up, giving him another opportunity at the NCAA Championship.
    
    
                  
    
    Having already qualified with a fourth place ranking in the 400 with 47.52, States Lee was just running the 200. Although he stood up at the start, he finished well, placing sixth in a personal best of 21.82.

    Men and Women Begin Season Undefeated Despite Depleted Roster - Virdi Sets MIT Pole Vault Record
    
    
                  
    
    April 5, 2014
    
    
                  
    
    The weather was a lot different from sunny California the week before, but the result very similar as MIT's Men's and Women's Track & Field teams dominated RPI and WPI in the annual Engineer's Cup despite resting many of their distance runners and taking precaution with quite a few injured athletes. The women were never contested, winning 12 of the 19 events and taking four of the six scoring places in three events en route to winning 184 to 110 for host RPI and 98 for WPI. The men also won 12 of the 19 events in taking the team victory with 165.5 to 146 for RPI and 87.5 for WPI.
    
    
                  
    
    The story of the meet was made by Cimmy Virdi '16, who won the Pole Vault in a new PR and MIT record of 13-3 1/2, currently the leading vault in the country for the DIII Indoor National Champion. Even though the temperatures varied between 44 degrees at the beginning of the meet to 39 at the end, with winds gusting in excess of 20mph, the vaulters performed well, claiming five of the six scoring places in the women's meet and four of six scoring places in the men's meet. Ben Schreck '15 won the men's vault at 15-03.
    
    
                  
    
    Ken Cooper '15 won his requisite three events, the Hammer Throw, Discus Throw and Shot Put, although the temperature challenged all the throwers efforts after the first event. That first event was the Hammer and Cooper threw a season best of 182-3. In the Discus he came from behind on his last throw to win with a mark of 155-4. In the Shot Put, Cooper had to take a standing throw to get a fair mark in the trials and then finally got a full throw in on the first attempt of the finals to win at 50-0 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    Throwing event victories for the women were earned by Tilly Taylor '15 in the Javelin and Isabella Stuopis '16 in the Shot Put. Throwing 123-3 despite the muddy approach Taylor managed to get decent but not great blocks without sliding too much. Stuopis threw 42-7 1/2 to win her event by over four feet.
    
    
                  
    
    Alexandra Taylor '14 was a double winner, taking both the 1500 and 800 meter races. In the 1500, she took over a slow paced race after the 800 mark and cruised to an easy victory in 4:54.19. For the 800, she negative split the race, coming through the first 400 in 69 and finishing in 2:17.83 despite the nasty headwind down the homestretch.
    
    
                  
    
    Maryann Gong '17 took the lead in the 5K and never relinquished it, negative splitting the race with 1600 splits of 5:45, 5:51, 5:28 and closing in 39 for a 17:43.43 victory.
    
    
                  
    
    Tech took both horizontal jumps for the men and women. Carrington Motley '16 won the Long Jump in a PR of 21-10 3/4 and teammate Angel Echevarria '16 won the Triple Jump with a jump of 46-0 1/2. Veronica Szklarzewski '15 won the Long Jump at 16-10 3/4 into a headwind and Michelle Johnson '15 took first place honors in the Triple Jump at 36-4 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Jackie Brew '14 fell over the first hurdle in the 100HH, an event she should have easily won, but she successfully navigated the 200 to victory, winning in 26.48 into the wind. 
    
    
                  
    
    States Lee '16 won his specialty, the 400, in a meager 49.87 as he led his teammates to a 1-2-3-6 finish and also took first place honors in the 200 with a 22.60.
    
    
                  
    
    Stephanie Birkhimer '14 moved up in events to the 400 and came away with a nice victory in 62.16.
    
    
                  
    
    Both the men and women claimed victory in the 4x100 Relay, even though both units went through numerous alterations due to injuries that popped up since the previous meet, including another one during practice on Thursday. The women went first and won in 49.48 with a quartet of Brew, Szklarzewski, Stephanie Birkhimer '14 and Jackie Konopka, despite the fact that Konopka had to nearly stop to wait on the baton. The men, with only one member remaining from the team that ran 41.98 last week, were caught off guard when the starter fired the gun without checking to see if the zones were ready. While Michael DuPlessis '14 was fine as the leadoff runner, Jordan Mizerak '14, Lee and Adrian Samsel '16 were not ready. Samsel had to sprint back to his position and did not even have time to put down a take-off marker. The first handoff worked well, but the next two were not so great. However, the team managed the victory in 43.30.
    
    
                  
    
    Christina Wicker '17 remained undefeated in the 3000 Steeplechase. Her winning time of 11:51.13 moved her into MIT's top 10 list at number 10. She has a ways to go to match the record of 10:04.76 set by Jacqui Wentz back in 2010, but she may get the freshman record of 11:08.37 once she has some competition.
    
    
                  
    
    Harrison Hunter '15 won the 800 by even splitting his race, a difficult thing to do in the wind he was subjected to. His first lap was 58.5 and he finished in 1:57.09.
    
    
                  
    
    Samsel ended his busy day with a victory in the 400IH. Despite slowing a bit in the homestretch as he headed into the wind, he won in 56.65.
    
    
                  
    
    The final victory of the meet for MIT came in the final event, the 4x400 Relay. While the women were so far ahead they pulled the relay, the men ran it. Holding out all of the top four 400 runners, MIT still won in a come from behind victory in 3:24.86. Austin Fathman '15 led off in 51.5. Henry Tareque '17 ran 52.9, but fell behind WPI. Hunter ran 50.2 to bring MIT within 10 meters as he handed off to Sam Parker '14. Parker ran 50.2 to pull out the victory right before the finish.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT travels to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine to test their skills against Bates, Colby and Southern Maine.

    Gong Sets Varsity / Freshman Record in 5K
    
    
                  
    
    April 18, 2014
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Track & Field team took a handful of athletes to the Friday evening distance festival portion of the Princeton University Larry Ellis Invitational. The cool temperatures and no wind were perfect conditions for the runners.
    
    
                  
    
    The highlight of the meet for the Engineers was Maryann's Gong performance in the fast section of the 5000 Meters. Gong '17 had only run one 5K previously, a sit and kick effort two weeks earlier that netted her a 17:43.43 win against RPI and WPI. This time she was with some very heavy hitters in East coast Division I runners as well as some high profile club runners. Gong started out in the middle of the 30+ runner field. The pace was perfect as she started clicking off 79-80 second quarters, hitting the 1600 in 5:17 and the 3200 in 10:37. At this point she started losing contact with the front runners in her group as they sped up slightly and she slid back to 81 and eventually 83 seconds before bringing it back in 80 for a final 1600 of 5:28. She finished in 16:45.86, which is a new MIT record, as well as a freshman record and currently the second fastest time in the country for Division III.
    
    
                  
    
    Earlier in the night, first up for MIT was Cindy Huang '15 in the 800 Meter race. Huang went out in the 400 at 66 seconds and was in the back of the pack, running comfortably. She then took off, running the next 400 hard, moving up the the front of the pack. With 200 to go she was about to take the lead when the wheels started to fall off the bus. It turned out she pushed too hard, too early. Her final 200 was a painful 39 seconds to finish in 2:19.23, a time far from her best.
    
    
                  
    
    Both Sam Parker '15 and Harrison Hunter '15 were entered in the 800. Hunter went first, racing in the fifth of eight sections. The pace was quick, and even though he was towards the back of the pack, he came through the 200 in 25 seconds. This was not the best of strategies, but he had to go with the pack. The pace slowed to 54 for the 400. It stayed this way through the 600 at 1:23 before Hunter took the lead and sprinted home to win the section in a new PR of 1:53.64. Parker was in the sixth section, and while the pace was not quite as fast as the previous section, Parker was not far behind at 26 seconds for the first 200. Per his usual tactics, Parker put himself on the rail and did not seem to want to come off, despite the frustration of being boxed in for more than 400 meters. With 200 to go Parker started moving to the front and in the final straight nearly pulled it off. He finished second in a new personal best of 1:52.46.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500, Alexandra Taylor '14 was testing her injured foot, which has prevented her from putting in very much mileage, but not from racing in her final season of eligibility. Again, the early pace was too fast as they hit the 400 in 70. She was relaxed and running well as they hit the 800 in 2:25 and the 1200 in 3:42. The fast first 400 and lack of mileage hit her about that point as she struggled in at 4:42.14.
    
    
                  
    
    Justin Bullock '14, continuing his comeback, and building on last week's 4:06 victory, was ready for a fast race. Also not back to high mileage, Bullock was not prepared for the 61 first 400, but did not let it affect his competitiveness. He continued to race through the 800 at 2:07 and the 1200 at 3:10. Despite his obvious fatigue, Bullock kept pushing and got a 3:58.02 for his efforts.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week MIT defends their NEWMAC Conference Championship titles at Mt. Holyoke College. The men have only lost once since the conference's inception back in 1997. The women are going for their sixth consecutive title.

    Three MIT Records Bring Women to Tie for 13th
    
    
                  
    
    14 All America Honors for MIT Highlight NCAA's
    
    
                  
    
    May 23, 2014
    
    
                  
    
    Day one of the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field Championship, hosted by Ohio Wesleyan in Delaware, Ohio, was an outstanding one for both the Men's and Women's teams from MIT. The 80 degree temperatures and sunny skies aided in producing some remarkable performances for all teams. Day two was also very warm, and although no one from MIT advanced to the finals there were some outstanding performances.
    
    
                  
    
    Adrian Samsel '16 began the Decathlon as the 14th seed out of the 20 competitors. He could not have expected a better start, dropping nearly .2 in the 100 to run 11.04, the fastest time run by any MIT sprinter this year. This started Samsel off in third place. In the second sub-event, the Long Jump, Samsel leaped 21-0 1/2, a bit off his usual mark and a foot and a half off his best, but he held onto fourth place. The throwing events are the big weakness in Samsel's armor, but he threw a personal best of 36-8 1/2 in the Shot Put to somewhat control the loss of places, moving him to eighth. Samsel finished day one with an outstanding 49.25 personal best in the 400, moving him back to fourth place.  In the second of competition, Samsel began with a new PR in the 110HH, clocking 15.15. Unfortunately his Discus Throw was not nearly as outstanding as he only threw 93-11, putting him in seventh place. In the Pole Vault he again set a personal best, clearing 12-5 1/2, but slid to 10th place overall as there were very good vaulters among the decathletes. The Javelin portion of the dec. was next and again one of Samsel's weak events hurt him as he threw 113-11, putting him in 15th place going into the 1500. He stood virtually no chance of placing (top eight), but the plan was to try. Knowing decathletes tend to take the pace out too hard, Samsel was directed to run 72 second pace and not get pulled out too fast. He did get pulled out too fast, but had the presence of mind not to go with the leaders. His first 400 was 69, hit the 800 in 2:33 and slowed a bit too much to split 3:38 at the 1200. Samsel was already moving hard, but brought it all in the final 150 to take the lead at the tape, winning in 4:28.20. The time moved him all the way to 10th place with a new PR of 6549 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Meanwhile, Ben Schreck '15 was taking care of business in the Pole Vault. The 18th seeded Schreck vaulted with near perfection as he cleared 15-7 on his first attempt, 15-11 on his second attempt and 16-0 3/4, a new outdoor personal best, on his first attempt. Only seven of the 20 vaulters cleared that height and Schreck earned sixth place on misses. He is knocking on the door to clear much higher heights and should get it in his senior year.
    
    
                  
    
    Ken Cooper '15, representing MIT in three events, competed in the first of those, the Hammer Throw, on day one. Struggling much of the year with bringing the correct balance of technical awareness and mental aggressiveness to each of his events, Cooper did not have it figured out on this day as he threw 165-7, far from his best.
    
    
                  
    
    Now that the men were through vaulting, it was time for second seed, Cimmy Virdi '16 to put on a show, and what a show it was. Coming in at 12-3 1/2, Virdi and Anna Etherington, a senior from Washington University of St. Louis, joined only three others to clear that height of the 22 athletes starting  the event. Both Virdi and Etherington cleared 12-11 1/2 on the first attempt, but no one else was able to even make the previous height, so it was now a battle of two. They matched each other, clearing on first attempt through 13-1 1/2, 13-3 1/2 and 13-5 1/4, a new personal best for Virdi. At 13-7 1/4, Virdi was unable to clear while Etherington succeeded. Virdi matched her seed and set a new MIT record in the process to score eight points for her team.
    
    
                  
    
    The Women's 3000 Meter Steeplechase trials was the first event on the track, and Martina de Geus, was completing her comeback from a torn ACL, which happened at this event a year ago. Throughout this amazing comeback, when even two months ago it did not seem possible, de Geus seemed extremely focused and determined to make it happen. She was in the first of two sections where the top five in each section and the next four fastest times would make the 14 runner final on Saturday. The early pace was appropriate, neither fast nor slow and de Geus just put herself among the top four to see what would happen. One runner opened up a lead and no one went with her. The chase pack stayed together through six laps and then de Geus and one other runner picked it up, dropping the pace from 87 seconds for the previous lap to 85 and then 82 in the final full quarter with de Geus opening up a little in the final 200 to finish second in 10:42.48 for the third fastest time going into Saturday's final.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up was the women's 4x100 Relay. Jackie Brew '14, Veronica Szklarzewski '15, Kendra Knittel '17 and Jackie Konopka '14 were seeded sixth going into the competition. Although the 47.55 that got them that seed had room for improvement, the ladies had run much slower the week before, making everyone anxious to see what would happen. Brew had a great start and ran the turn aggressively. However, Szklarzewski left a half step early, and with the handoff already stretched to the middle of the zone, she had to slow to get the baton from Brew. She ran an excellent straight and the handoff to Knittel was flawless. Knittel ran a powerful turn, passing runners in the final twenty meters, but ran up on a slow moving Konopka, who did not get out well as she was trying a different start. Knittel had to wait until Konopka got into the zone and Konopka had to get up to speed. Once moving she held her own, but the quartet lost a good half second on that handoff. The foursome finished fifth in their section, but beat the fourth team from the second section, putting them in eighth overall and making the final on Saturday.
    
    
                  
    
    Elaine McVay '15, the 18th seed in the 10K, had finished third a year ago by running a smart race, coming from behind to catch those falling off the pace at the end of the race. This race, the entire pace went out hard and she felt confident enough to go with the leaders. The first 400 was 81 seconds, and then the two leaders continued that pace while the remainder of the pack dropped back to 84's, still amazingly fast. The 1600 split was 5:34 and the 3200 11:15, much faster than McVay had ever done in a 10K. McVay was in sixth place and doing a great job of staying focused. The third mile slowed a bit, but the 5K was still 17:43 for McVay. No longer able to hold that pace after 6800 meters, McVay slowed to 89 and then 90 second quarters, which saw her slowly slip to 10th place. Despite a small and painful last two laps in 87 and 85, she could not make up the necessary ground in this very fast field that saw the winner run 34:25. McVay finished in 36:12.95, going for it right from the gun.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event of day one was the Men's 4x400. With Samsel fatigued and over heated from his five sub-events in the Decathlon, the decision was made to go with Harrison Hunter '15, who had also qualified in the 800, to join States Lee '16, Derek Barnes '16 and Tyler Singer-Clark '14 for the trials in the event. Assuming it would take a sub 3:14 to make finals, MIT knew Lee would have to have a big first leg and Barnes would have to have a much better handoff than is typical of the sophomore. Lee ran a very aggressive first 200, which led to a bit more fatigue than is usually seen from him in the final 100 meters. The 47.9 was solid, but not what Tech needed. Nevertheless, Barnes had an excellent handoff and took off like he had stolen something. The first 200 was exceptional, putting MIT in first at that point, and gave Barnes a best ever 48.2 second leg, putting MIT in third at the handoff. A very anxious Hunter took off too soon, realized it, slowed and got the baton at close to the standstill. However, once the 6' 7" runner got some momentum, the adrenalin kept it going as the junior ran a very unexpected 48.3 to keep MIT in third. Singer-Clark, who had had a cold for a week and still feeling the effects of it, certainly did not let that affect him mentally. However, going out to hold onto third place against some very fast anchor legs meant he had to go out a bit faster than his body was prepared for. In the final 50 meters, two teams passed Singer-Clark, one right at the finish line despite the senior's 47.8 leg and an overall time of 3:12.31.  MIT had to wait a few minutes to see if their fifth place time would be faster than the previous section's fourth place time. Just as the women had done in the 4x100 Relay, the men squeaked in by .61 seconds for the eighth spot in Saturday's final.
    
    
                  
    
    Other than the Decathlon, Ken Cooper started off Day two with the Shot Put. On his third throw Cooper threw 53-3 1/2 to move up to 10th place. There is now video at some of the field events, which can be used in case of protests against official's calls for fouls. Two protests were filed, so initially the officials were going to take the top 11 to finals rather than the top nine, which meant Cooper would throw in the finals. After much deliberation, one foul was overturned, one denied and they decided to only take nine to the finals, leaving Cooper out by one centimeter.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 100HH, both Jackie Brew and Jackie Konopka had qualified among the 22 allowed in the field. Brew was seeded sixth and Konopka 17th, both with wind aided times. In the trials, neither had a tailwind, but both competed very well. Brew ran 14.34 and Konopka 14.57, the fastest non wind-aided times they have ever run. Brew ended up 10th overall and Konopka 18th.
    
    
                  
    
    States Lee was up in the 400 and seeded to place fourth. Lee was still hurting from going out too fast the night before in the 4x400 and backed off too much, splitting the first 200 in 23.1. Lee closed hard in the final 100, placing third in his heat, running 48.16, which placed him 10th overall, just missing finals by .07.
    
    
                  
    
    The final events for Tech on day two were the Men's and Women's 800. Cindy Huang '15 was seeded 14th going into the race and was ready to get the job done. Running very smart, her heat ran a very evenly split race. Huang, running in the back of the pack, split the first 400 in 66.01, moved into position on the backstretch and taking over third place on the final turn. On the final straight she lost two places, ending up  fifth in her heat and 16th overall in 2:12.79 for a very well run race.
    
    
                  
    
    Harrison Hunter was seeded 18th of 20, and despite his 48.3 4x400 leg the night before, was ready to run a great race. Unfortunately for him, he got pulled out in the fastest heat, running 53.01 for the first 400, well off the leaders in third. Not accustomed to that quick a pace, Hunter was in a distant third at the 500 mark. At that point he started to give up, but fortunately, at 600 meters a runner came up on him, waking him up. Hunter pressed hard the final 200, closing well, but finishing fourth in his heat in 1:51.65, .01 off his PR. Hunter had the eighth fastest time overall, but the advancing formula was top two in each heat and the next two fastest, which left him out of the final.
    
    
                  
    
    Day three could not have started much better. Tilly Taylor '15, seeded 17th in the Javelin Throw, was not getting anything done in her first two throws of the  trials and that needed to change. On her final throw she really brought her best effort, winning the flight with a new PR and MIT record of 145-7. This mark held up for fifth overall, earning Taylor her first All America award.
    
    
                  
    
    Cooper was in his third event, the Discus Throw, in which he was seeded 13th. He did not have an amazing throw, which it would have taken to make finals, but he did throw a solid 160-6 to finish 12th in the event.
    
    
                  
    
    Carrington Motley '16, seeded fourth in the Triple Jump, had trouble getting his mark for some reason, fouling  his first two attempts. On his final jump he hit the sand at 45-1 1/2, failing to make finals after a very successful season. The sophomore no doubt will be sure to do better in 2015.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, de Geus was up in the finals of the 3000 Steeplechase final. Her early pace was exactly the same as the trials as she hung out towards the back of the main pack. When three runners broke away, de Geus stayed back, being cautious. With 1000 meters to go she started to move a bit, pulling out to fifth place, but not speeding up, simply not slowing down as much as the others. With 600 to go she picked it up, but did not put her opponents away. With 150 to go they started coming up to de Geus, passing her on the homestretch, but she held onto seventh place in a season best 10:40.37 to earn her first All America honor. de Geus has had an amazing comeback to even be at this meet. To earn seventh place and score two points for her team at Nationals is nothing short of remarkable.
    
    
                  
    
    Next was the Women's 4x100 Relay. Seeded eighth going into the finals, Brew, Szklarzewski, Knittel and Konopka new they had to stretch the zones and take a chance on the handoffs. In the first exchange, Brew seemed to have a little difficulty catching Szklarzewski, but the handoff stretched the zone well and kept the speed up through the handoff. For some reason, the exchange between Szklarzewski and Knittel that worked perfectly on Thursday was awful today as Szklarzewski caught Knittel well before the zone and had to wait for her to get to the exchange area. On the other end of that exchange, Knittel could not catch Konopka as she seemed to get out early, and had to slow to make the handoff. It was quite amazing the quartet made it to Nationals and the finals, so earning All America and finishing eighth, even though they ran 48.18 has to feel very satisfying for quartet.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's 5K was Maryann Gong's '17 debut at outdoor nationals and she was seeded seventh in a very talented field. Gong knew this and was very anxious to race, as well as nervous about how the race might break out. Despite the 80 degree temperature and sunny skies, the pace was fast. The opening quarter was 77 and the 1600 5:15. Gong was racing in the front pack, hanging out in the fifth position most of the first two miles, which they hit in 10:39. 400 meters later the pace slowed a bit, Gong tripped a little, and began thinking she was tired because she began to hurt from the pace slowing. After two 85's, she woke up and began picking it up, which of course made her feel better. She worked her way to a 75 400, to go from ninth to eighth, and held onto  it with a 37 final 200 to run 16:43.28, a new MIT varsity and freshman record.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event of the meet was the Men's 4x400. The decision was made to allow Samsel to take his place on the relay, meaning Hunter would be in the support role. Seeded eighth after the trials, the foursome of Lee, Barnes, Samsel and Singer-Clark knew they would have to be at their best to place higher than their seed. They also knew all the teams were tired and that they needed to be ready to take advantage of that. Out of lane one, Lee made up the three turn stagger on most teams, splitting 47.7.  However, Barnes continued to misjudge the handoff, coming to a near stop before he received the baton. Once the baton was in hand, Barnes ripped the first 200, knowing the teams would close down on lane one after the first turn. He managed to position himself in third place and held that through the exchange to Samsel, splitting 48.7, due largely to the standing start after the handoff. Although that handoff was not so great, Samsel ran an excellent leg, handing off in third after a 47.9 leg. Singer-Clark received the baton in lane four despite Samsel coming in in lane three, which certainly affected the efficiency of the handoff. Pacing himself much better than two days earlier, Singer-Clark had something in the tank coming down the homestretch. He was still passed in the final 10 meters, but by only one team, giving Tech fourth place in 3:12.28 and a 47.7 split for Singer-Clark.
    
    
                  
    
    All in all, the Engineers finished with 14 All America honors. The women earned a tie for 13th place with 16 points and the men tied for 33rd with eight points. As the meet was ending, the team was already setting individual and team goals for next year, thinking perhaps both teams might have the opportunity to get on the podium, being one of the top four teams at this meet, which generally takes at least 30 points, and sometimes as much as 40+.

    MIT Men and Women Run Away With New England Division III Titles
    
    
                  
    
    May 1-3, 2014
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Track & Field men's and women's teams traveled to Springfield College this weekend as favorites to win the New England Division III Championship. Despite a season full of injuries to long sprinters the men were heavy favorites. The women, going through a trying season of injuries as well, were very slight favorites over the very talented and competitive Williams College team.
    
    
                  
    
    With Spring finally breaking in New England, providing 60+ degree temperatures, Adrian Samsel '16 started things off with the two day Decathlon. Seeded second, Samsel does what he does best, set PR after PR. He started with an 11.23 100 and then added a 21-11 long jump, both personal bests. He then performed more normally in the Shot with a 36-0 3/4 effort and only managed a 5-11 1/4 High Jump. He saved the best for last as his fifth event, and last of day one was a 49.73 400 for his third PR of the day. Day two was more of the same as he began with a 15.27 in the 110HH, a 94-3 in the Discus, a huge 12-3 1/2 in the Pole Vault, and a 115-8 in the Javelin. With one event to go, Samsel trailed for the first time in the competition, just 22 points short of first. The 1500 is a solid event for Samsel and he delivered a 4:31.40 to win by over 200 points and a total of 6472 points to put himself eleventh on the NCAA list. Every event on day two was a new personal best.
    
    
                  
    
    Between the Decathlon Pole Vault and Javelin Throw, the Men's Long Jump was going on. Timing worked out well and Samsel was able to squeeze in all three trials efforts, popping a 22-6 1/2 PR, good for fifth place overall. Teammate Carrington Motley '16 did one centimeter better for a 22-7 performance, placing fourth. 
    
    
                  
    
    The Hammer was going on at the same time and Ken Cooper '15 was taking care of business. Cooper placed second with a throw of 185-7, just missing first place. Cooper had a nice series of throws, showing he is ready for a big throw in the near future.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event of day two for the men was the 10K. Tech had seven entries in the event, hoping to score major points. The weather was perfect and Gary Ezzo of Coast Guard blasted off at the gun, intending to run away with the event and take advantage of the weather. His first quarter was 70 seconds, but the MIT squad was ready for the move and maintained contact between 71-73 seconds. He quickly realized he was not going to run away with it that easily and the pace settled into 75 second quarters. At the 1600 mark, Benji Xie '15 and Allen Leung '15 were right on Ezzo's tail at 4:53. Roy Wedge '14 and Matt Jordan '15 were at 4:55. Brian Gilligan '17, Matt Deyo '16 and Matt McEachern '17 had fallen off the extremely fast pace, but were still under 5:00. The second mile was 4:56 and the third a 4:58 for a 14:48, but Leung fell off the pace, coming through in 4:56. Now the lead group was just four and stayed that way through five miles when Jordan fell off the lead group as they leaders hit 24:49. With 500 meters to go, Wedge took off, burying the final 400 in 62 seconds to win in a huge PR of 30:50.06. Xie fell off the pace with two laps to go, but held on for third in 31:05.70. Jordan also held on, placing fourth in a PR of 31:16.88. Leung faded, but held onto seventh, just missing sixth in 32:08.57. The 23 points in the 10K gave the Engineers 50 points going into the final day of competition, 30 points up on the field.
    
    
                  
    
    The women had an equally great start. Not entering anyone in the Heptathlon, MIT's first competitor was Tilly Taylor '15 in the Javelin. Taylor took the lead on her fifth throw, a 137-5 effort. However, on the final throw of the event, she was passed, settling for second place, two places higher than she was seeded.
    
    
                  
    
    At the same time, the Long Jump was taking place. Jackie Konopka '14, seeded well out of the scoring, popped a great jump to make finals and then jumped a PR 17-5 1/2 to place fifth. Veronica Szklarzewski '15 missed finals by one centimeter, not getting credit for a great third attempt that was questionably called a foul.
    
    
                  
    
    As the women's 10K was kicking off, the women's hammer was well under way. Ashley Wheeler '15 and Ellen Liverpool '15, seeded 6th and 7th going into the competition, performed well. Liverpool had a solid first throw, which had her in seventh going into finals. Wheeler had an excellent series, but just squeaked into finals in ninth position. On her second throw of finals, Wheeler threw 154-7 to move into sixth, pushing Liverpool back to eighth. Jackie Vahey '17 did not place but improved her own freshmen record to 146-8. Isabella Stuopis '16 also set a PR, throwing 145-1.
    
    
                  
    
    The women ended Friday night with the 10K. Unlike their male counterparts, the women only had two entries representing MIT, but they were the right two, Elaine McVay '15 and Kaitlin Allen '14. The plan was to go with the leader if someone were to take it out at a pace that would yield a sub 37:00 time, and if not, to set an 89 second quarter pace to hit the 37:00 mark, a time figured to net first and second place. Sure enough, no one wanted to establish a fast pace. McVay and Allen took over pacing duties 300 meters into the race, hitting the first 400 in 92 and no one going with them. As they picked up the pace to 89, one runner joined them, but that was short lived. The pair rattled off 1600 splits of 5:53, 5:54, 5:54, 5:56, 5:59, and 6:00 before closing out with an 84 second quarter to put McVay in first in 37:00.36 and Allen in second in 37:00.54, a new PR. The women ended day one with a fantastic 34 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The final day of competition began very well as the attitude of the MIT athletes was simply relentless. They refused to fall down and the support was incredible, event to event. Cooper was back in action, this time winning the Discus with a 164-7 performance. At the same time, Motley put together a 46-11 1/2 Triple Jump performance to place third. Teammate, Angel Echevarria '16 placed fourth with a personal best 46-10 1/4 jump.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Rory Beyer '17 continued his weekly improvement in the 3000 Steeplechase. Seeded ninth, Beyer knew he would have to establish himself amongst the leaders or the pace would get away from him, making it very difficult to catch up at the end. The pace was fast, too fast for Beyer, but he settled into sixth place, gradually working his way up in the field. The 1600 pace was 4:57, quite a bit faster than he had ever done. He ran his slowest quarter of 79 at that point and then started to move, running back to back 78's as the field was dying up front. He moved hard in the final 200, moving into third place with 80 meters to go when another runner kicked past him. Beyer surged again, just missing third by .2 seconds. Beyer ran his final 200 in 34 seconds, showing he has more left to improve.
    
    
                  
    
    The 4x100 Relay team was up next. Last year MIT placed fifth at nationals in this event, but with the injuries, resulting lack of practice time and having a different foursome every week, MIT was only seeded third going into this meet. Michael DuPlessis '14, at least .2 slower than the same time next year, was the leadoff runner. DuPlessis seemed to hold his own and the handoff to Nick Diamantoni '15, himself coming off a hamstring injury earlier in the season was solid. Diamantoni ran an excellent leg, actually running up on States Lee '16, which itself cost a lot of time. Lee, the only totally healthy member of the team, ran well, handing off to Tyler Singer-Clark, making his return to 4x100 duties. Singer-Clark showed some of his old speed, but not quite all of it, as he closed to second place in 42.48. Southern Maine ran a faster time in the section before to win overall and send MIT back to third place.
    
    
                  
    
    The next event on the track where MIT was seeded to score was the 400. Lee was seeded to win and Derek Barnes '16 was seeded seventh. Both were in the fast section. Lee went out very hard, probably pushing the first 200 too hard, but he is strong enough to do that and still win, which he did in 48.49. Barnes had a great run, finishing third in 49.09. At this point MIT was up over 50 points and had virtually won the meet. However, the men were driven and did not let up.
    
    
                  
    
    Cooper was up in the Shot Put, and while he did not have his best performance, he placed third with a throw of 49-5 3/4. After fouling out last week it was clear he was being cautious and holding back a bit.
    
    
                  
    
    At the same time, the men's Pole Vault was finally about to start after taking the time to move a better pit into position. Jordan Mizerak '14, a vaulter converted from the multi-events, had pulled his hamstring three weeks earlier. His dedication to the team and determination to compete at this meet has been phenomenal. He not only was able to compete, he cleared a personal best of 15-3 to earn fifth place, a nice four point bonus. Ben Schreck '15, also cleared 15-3, tying for second place based on fewer misses.
    
    
                  
    
    The 800 was up next, with Sam Parker '15 seeded first and Harrison Hunter '15 seeded seventh. The pace was quick, hitting the first 400 in 54 seconds. Parker was in great position and Hunter was in the back of the tight pack. With 300 to go, Hunter screamed down the backstretch, taking the lead with 200 to go. With 100 to go, Hunter lost the lead and looked as if he may start to fade. However, he fought back, again surging to the lead and winning in a personal best of 1:52.28, a time that moves him to 10th on the NCAA list. Parker ran a fine race but did not seem to have the fight in the final 100, even slowing before the finish line to fall from fourth to fifth in 1:53.91.
    
    
                  
    
    Without Michael Kaba '16, out with his own hamstring issues, in the 4x100, 4x400, 110HH and 400IH MIT was missing a lot of points. The best substitution in the 400IH was Samsel. Although he was fatigued from the Decathlon and Long Jump the past two days, he is extremely talented in this event. His start, normally very reliable, put him slightly off in his first three hurdles, preventing him from getting out with the leaders. He made a strong comeback in the final 200, moving up to fifth place in a personal best 54.66. Next week he will go after the event fresh to see what he can do.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 200, Lee, Singer-Clark and Barnes were back in business. Barnes, running in an earlier section due to his slow seed time, ran 22.48 to place 10th overall, just out of the scoring. Singer-Clark in the next to fastest section, ran 22.40 to tie for seventh place. Lee, having a horrible start out of the blocks, got behind early. He made up significant ground in the final 50 meters, moving from seventh to third in 22.02.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT was so far ahead at this point that they pulled three of their 5K runners, who were all seeded to score, as well as their top seeded 4x400 team. Two of the 5K runners wanted to race, Matt Jordan  and Matt Deyo, both having raced in the 10K the night before. The pace began slow, but then a lead group of four moved ahead, separating themselves from the group Jordan and Deyo ran with, settling with 73-74 second 400's through 11 laps. One of the runners fell off the lead group and both Jordan and Deyo picked him off as both accelerated to 72 and then 32 in the final 600 meters. Jordan placed fourth in 15:13.97 and Deyo ran 15:16.22 for fifth.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event for the MIT was the 4x800 Relay. This was an event MIT thought they could win even though Bowdoin College loaded up the event with excellent fresh runners. Henry Tareque '17 led off for MIT. He was cautious for the first time this year as he settled in for the second 200, coming through an uncharacteristically slow 58.2. He ran a 61 final 400 to split 1:59.8, putting MIT back in seventh place. Hunter got the baton, moving patiently through the field. His 55.4 first 400 put him at the front. He finished in 1:53.9 to give MIT a slight lead. Rick Paez '15 ran an excellent leg, hitting 55.3 for the first 400 to keep MIT in front. On his second 400 he lost the lead, but was only about 15-20 meters back in third place as he handed off to Parker with a 1:56.1 leg. Parker did not go after the leaders, instead seeming to settle for third place as he fell well behind with a very uninspired 57.5 first 400. He maintained his position in the final quarter, running 1:58.4 to give Tech third place in 7:48.48.
    
    
                  
    
    The final score had MIT 80 points up on the second place team, Bates College, 159.83 to 79.33. Bridgewater State was third of the 32 scoring teams with 67 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The final day for the women did not begin with the same level of success as the men, but the ladies never gave up. In the Shot Put, the women were seeded third and fourth with Stuopis and Vahey respectively. Stuopis threw her seed, placing third at 42-9 3/4. Vahey threw just 10 centimeters less than her best, but was only able to place ninth as many of the throwers threw personal bests.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Pole Vault, the Engineers were seeded first, fifth, sixth and eighth and were expecting their usually domination. Cimmy Virdi '16 did what she was supposed to do, placing first at 12-2 1/2. Although a couple of vaulters did not handle the pressure well, Abby Klein '14 seized the opportunity of a nice tailwind and excellent temperatures to clear a PR of 11-8 1/2, placing fourth.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Martina deGeus '14, seeded fifth, showed her comeback from ACL surgery last summer is complete. She ran conservatively in pace and on the barriers, but accelerated to an 85 quarter with 600 to go to move into second place and finished with a 38 final 200 to show she has a lot more in the tank. Her time of 10:45.76 moved her to number five on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x100, the seventh seeded quartet of Jackie Brew '14, Szklarzewski, Kendra Knittel '17 and Konopka had not raced together in five weeks and only practiced together once. The ladies ran fast, but the handoffs showed the lack of practice. Brew had trouble getting the baton to Szklarzewski and then she in turn was holding the baton such that not much was exposed and took too long to get it into Knittel's hand. Knittel missed Konopka the first time, causing Konopka to break slightly before receiving the baton. All this served to move them to fifth place in a season best 48.11, number 18 on the national list. With two more weeks to practice and improve the quartet hopes to move up on that list.
    
    
                  
    
    The jumps were not their usual strength for MIT, as they were seeded second in the High Jump, but failed to score. Natalie Alper '17 did jump a season best of 5-2 1/4. Michelle Johnson '15, seeded ninth in the Triple Jump, pulled out an eighth place at 36-1 1/2, although she was hoping for a much higher place.
    
    
                  
    
    Fortunately, the Engineers again found a way to rebound. Seeded only for third in the Discus, Vahey pulled out a second while Christine Labaza '14 stepped up big for a fourth place and Stuopis made up for what she thought she should have done in the Shot Put by getting a seventh place at 117-10 for a new PR.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, number three seed Maryann Gong '17 was up in the 1500. Gong ran an excellent race, moving up with 300 meters to go, taking the lead with 200 to go and apparently sprinting away from the field when she suddenly put the brakes on with 50 meters to go thinking she had one more lap remaining. As she faded to third, crossing the line in 4:38.45 she realized her error. Too bad for Gong, but it will likely make for a great anecdote for years to come. Louise van den Heuvel '14, running out of the slow section, ran away with the section win, placing ninth overall in 4:47.79.
    
    
                  
    
    Having qualified out of the morning trials, Brew and Konopka were in the 100HH final. Seeded fifth and sixth, their goal was to split the Tufts runners seeded third and fourth as prior to the meet, it was presumed Tufts would also be a team contender for the title, based largely on the sprint and hurdle events. The results could not have been better. Running into a slight headwind, Brew ran a PR 14.56 to earn third place, beating both Tufts runners. Konopka also ran a PR, placing fifth in 14.72 to defeat one of the Tufts runners. Brew's time moves her to 16th on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Not seeded to score, Szklarzewski qualified for the 100 Meter final. She not only made the final, she placed fifth in a personal best 12.47 for a needed four points. At this point, MIT was up on Williams by about 40 points and looking as though the victory was in the bag. Like the men, the women did not take the foot off the accelerator.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 800, MIT was seeded sixth and eighth. Cindy Huang '15 raised that bet, running a PR of 2:15.44 as she positioned herself well with a 68 first quarter, then worked down the backstretch to move up with the leaders. She finished in third to give Tech six more points.
    
    
                  
    
    Certain of the victory, MIT pulled McVay from the 5K and scratched the 4x400 relay, both of which would have scored very well. Running the 5K was a determined Gong, Allen and Nicole Zeinstra '16. The pace was pretty slow by Gong standards as the leaders ran 5:41 for the first 1600 and 5:42 for the second 1600. Allen, feeling good at the start, could feel the effects of the 10K as she made her way into the mid part of the race. Zeinstra got pulled off her race plan and started to panic early. Making sure she counted laps, Gong took off with 900 meters to go. Her next 800 was 2:36 and her final 200 a 38 as she pulled away to win by 12 seconds. in 17:27.26. Allen made a comeback, passing down the final straight, running 36 seconds for the final 200 to take sixth in 17:48.60.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x800, MIT had a solid quartet of Christina Wicker '17, Alexandra Shade '17, van den Heuvel and Huang. Wicker was unable to put MIT in front, fading in the final 300 meters after a 68 first 400. Her split of 2:23.2 had MIT back in the pack. Shade went out in 66.6 to bring MIT up to the front and then took the lead as she split 2:18.9. van den Heuvel only ran 2:22.3, but she kept MIT close, handing off in second place.  Huang went out hard, determined to make up the gap and put her team in position to win on the final lap. Her 66.5 did just that and then she capped it off with her second 2:15 of the day, bringing her team in first in 9:20.17.
    
    
                  
    
    The final point total had MIT with 132 points to 85 for Williams and 50 for third place Tufts out of the 33 scoring teams.
    
    
                  
    
    Now the Engineers will focus on the NCAA Division III Championship in three weeks and qualifying via the next two weeks of championships. Next week, MIT travels to Westfield State College, the host of the NEICAAA Championship, a meet that brings together all the Division I, II and III colleges in New England.

    MIT Stars Shine at NEICAAA Championship
    
    
                  
    
    Women Claim Two Varsity and Two Freshman Records
    
    
                  
    
    May 9-10, 2014
    
    
                  
    
    Day one of the New England Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association (NEICAAA) Outdoor Track & Field Championship hosted by Westfield State College was not a very bright day for the track & field teams from MIT. Amid the mess of performances, even the more reliable competitors were having a tough day. Carrington Motley '16 fouled out of the Long Jump, Cimmy Virdi '16 no-heighted in the Pole Vault and things just seemed to be going from bad to worse. States Lee '16 qualified for the 400 finals, but looked tired and beat, running a slow 48.74. The one exception was the performance  turned in by Adrian Samsel '16, running a personal best of 53.71 in the 400IH to qualify for finals.
    
    
                  
    
    The team had come off an emotional two weeks of championships in which they felt the pressure and expectation of winning, and those successful experiences took a toll on the mental and physical reserves of the Engineers. They were flat, lacking the competitive edge and bringing nothing to the track. Fortunately, the team is resilient and realized they were letting an excellent opportunity slip away. This meet is the setting where all three NCAA divisions (I, II and III) compete against each other for the New England title. Most Division III teams use the opportunity to focus on qualifying their athletes for the NCAA Division III Championship two weeks later. MIT was one of those teams. Leaving all 5K and 10K runners at home to recuperate from the past two weekends, Tech was in no position to go for yet another team title, but they were prepared to live up to their tradition and reputation and bring their best.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two was projected to have thunderstorms throughout the day, but warm temperatures. The weather seemed to mirror the attitude of the MIT athletes. A different day, a different attitude, and MIT came to play. The rain stopped, the sun came out and the temperatures rose to near 90. The Men's 4x100 Relay started things off for Tech. Michael DuPlessis '14, Nick Diamantoni '15, States Lee '16 and Tyler Singer-Clark '14 put together an excellent race, running a season best 41.93 for fifth place despite a poor baton exchange from Diamantoni to Lee. If the Engineers can fix that exchange they can probably drop the .4 necessary to return to the NCAA Division III Championship where they placed fifth in 2013. The ball was rolling and gaining momentum. The women were next. The quartet of Jackie Brew '14, Veronica Szklarzewski '15, Kendra Knittel '17 and Jackie Konopka '14 were determined to take care of the business of qualifying for Nationals and they did just that. With the exception of Knittel having to slow slightly to get the baton from Szklarzewski, the handoffs were excellent, producing a time of 47.55 for the sixth best time in Division III.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, Ken Cooper '15 was having a pretty solid weekend, placing in all three of his events. On the first day Cooper placed eighth in the Hammer with a throw of 185-2. On day two Cooper placed fourth in the Discus, throwing 158-7 and then took sixth in the Shot Put at 51-11 3/4. The ladies held their own and then some in the throws. Isabella Stuopis '16 had her best throw on her final throw, placing fifth with an outdoor PR of 43-06. In the Discus, Stuopis threw another personal best, this one good for eighth place at 127-2. Jackie Vahey '17, placed fourth and once again reset the Freshman and Varsity record at 134-0.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Triple Jump, Motley redeemed himself when he placed seventh at 46-6 3/4. Michelle Johnson '15 did not place, but jumped her best all season, a 37-0 1/4 effort.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track the momentum could not be stopped. Justin Bullock '14, barely getting in any training as he manages his leg injury, continues to show his true competitive spirit. Despite the pace going out in 60.9 for the opening quarter, Bullock held on and raced to a 3:54.91 personal best. Not to be outdone, freshman standout Maryann Gong took to the shorter distance with plans on running fast and that she did. Just like the men's race, the opening quarter was a blazing 69.4. Gong did what she does best, not thinking, just racing. She moved up throughout the race, running 2:22.9 and 3:37.4 through 800 and 1200 meters, closing the final 300 in 54 to place third in 4:31.24. The new personal best set the MIT Freshman record and puts her at number seven in the country.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up for MIT was the Men's 400 final. Lee showed what a difference attitude can make as he was fully engaged in the final. Getting out hard, but relaxed, Lee cruised the opening 100 then moved hard in the second 100 to position himself to fight for the win. Racing the turn and then brining it home hard earned Lee second place with a new personal best of 47.53, the fourth fastest time in Division III.
    
    
                  
    
    Harrison Hunter '15 and Sam Parker '15 took to the track in the 800 final. Both were seeded in the third fastest of four sections despite their fast times. Hunter, having won every 800 race this year, was hoping to continue this trend. Parker was hoping to be the one who ended the streak as long as his teammate also ran well. The 55.1 first quarter pace was relatively slow if they were hoping for a fast time, but Hunter, who just races to win, did not pay attention. Parker took the lead with 300 to go, a great move to go for the win. Hunter was right behind him and took over the lead with 200 to go, never looking back as he remained undefeated, winning his section with a new PR of 1:51.64, putting him 13th on the NCAA list. Parker tied up in the final 100, but still ran a very respectable 1:52.86.
    
    
                  
    
    Cindy Huang '15 was in the second to fastest section of the Women's 800. The initial pace was a little slow at 65.7, but fast enough. Huang moved to the front on the second lap, taking the lead with 180 to go, sprinting to the finish and maintaining her form through the line for the victory, a new PR and MIT record of 2:12.40. The fast section went out in a suicidal 60 and everyone followed. All but the first two runners imploded in the final 200, allowing Huang to place third overall and moved to 13th on the NCAA Division III list.
    
    
                  
    
    Samsel was up in the 400IH final. He wanted to get out faster, yet stay in rhythm to avoid stuttering. Unfortunately the increased speed put him too close to the hurdles, causing an unusual amount of chopped steps. This put him out of the race for the victory very quickly. Samsel finished well to place eighth in 54.31.
    
    
                  
    
    The fast section of the Women's 3000 Steeplechase was up next and Martina de Geus was waiting to be tested by the Division I athletes. Unfortunately, the race broke apart right away as the top three seeds went out in 70 for the first quarter. de Geus stayed in the back of the more casual runners, coming through in 81. The trail group should not be confused with a chase group as the pace was not ambitious at all, slowing to 88 seconds by lap three. This forced de Geus to the front, but she was reluctant to go after the leaders, who at this point were also running very slow. With 600 to go de Geus opened up to an 85 quarter and then closed with a 39 final 200 to capture third in a season best 10:42.46.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event was the 4x400 Relay. Substituting Samsel for the injured Michael Kaba '16, and with Singer-Clark not appearing to be in top condition following his hamstring injury early in the season, there was doubt that this group, which included Lee and Derek Barnes '16, could return to the level that would earn them a trip to Nationals. Fortunately, those in doubt did not include the four running the relay. Lee brought his A game, delivering a 47.4 leadoff. A solid handoff to Barnes put Tech in second place. Barnes did not get out very aggressively, but finished well to run a 48.4 split. Barnes closed the gap on first, but fell back to third at the handoff. Samsel did not match Barnes's speed at the handoff, but overall having a fair handoff. Samsel dropped to fourth, but closed well on the homestretch moving to second at the handoff with a 48.6 split. Singer-Clark got out really slowly, losing the advantage Samsel had given him. However, he moved ahead with a burst of speed and held onto second place until the final 150 when he fell to third, holding that to the finish with a 47.8 split for a 3:12.23 cumulative time, putting them in fourth on the Division III national list.
    
    
                  
    
    Both the men and women finished with 30 points, the men placing ninth and the women 10th. With one week to go to compete for a spot at Nationals and an opportunity to earn All America honors, the Tech athletes will travel to RPI in Troy, NY for the ECAC Division III Championship while a couple of athletes will compete at Princeton in the IC4A Championship.

    Both Men and Women Retain NEWMAC Titles
    
    
                  
    
    Cooper, Gong, Lee Earn Awards
    
    
                  
    
    April 26, 2014
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Track & Field team rolled onto the campus of host Mt. Holyoke College with the intent of continuing the streak of NEWMAC Outdoor Track & Field titles, competing at a championship level and not sustaining any more injuries. With the exception of a couple of event areas in which the competitiveness just was not there, all goals were accomplished.
    
    
                  
    
    The weather posed an obstacle early on as temperatures in the mid 40's combined with rain to make things very uncomfortable in the jumps and throws. About half-way through the meet, the sun came through and the temperature approached mid 50's to make for a much more cooperative environment for track and field performances.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were seeded to win their sixth consecutive NEWMAC title, so despite pulling Kendra Knittel '17, seeded second in the 400  and a key leg of the 4x100 Relay, due to a hamstring tightness, and taking Jackie Konopka '14 out of the High Jump when that event was moved to Smith College due to the rain, they were not deterred.
    
    
                  
    
    Despite the confidence, or possibly due to over confidence, the meet did not start as expected. On the track the 10K was a disappointment as MIT was only able to claim two points. Shivani Kaushal '15 came through with a seventh place 40:07.30. At the same time, an expected 13 points in the Triple Jump turned into eight as the jumpers just did not seem to take the competition seriously. In the Javelin, an expected win turned into a dismal second place. To top things off, pulling Knittle out of the meet meant no 4x100 Relay, an event where Tech was seeded second.
    
    
                  
    
    All of this could have derailed the Engineers, but fortunately, the women righted the ship. In the Pole Vault, Cimmy Virdi '16 won with a vault of 12-7 1/2 and was supported by a second and third from Abby Klein '14 and Jenn Tylock '17 at 11-5 3/4 and a fifth from Joanna Chen '15 at 10-6. The 28 points went a long way to curing what was ailing the Engineer's. At the same time, Isabella Stuopis '16 won the Shot Put with a throw of 40-6 1/4. Although Jackie Vahey '17 did not finish second where she was seeded, she did finish third at 35-5 1/4. However, Christine Labaza '14, not seeded to score, came through with a fifth place 34-10 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, after Martina de Geus '14 came through with a second place 11:01.55 performance in the 3000 Steeplechase, Maryann Gong '17 ran an excellent 4:38.15 despite an opening 400 in 78 seconds to win the 1500. MIT did not support with additional points the way they should have as both Alexandra Taylor '14 and Christina Wicker '17 are battling injuries, but Louise van den Heuvel '14 did finish fourth in 4:45.19. 
    
    
                  
    
    Konopka and Jackie Brew '14 came through in the 100HH to earn their seeds of second and third respectively. Konopka ran a season best 14.98 and Brew finished in 15.28 due in part to her injured achilles tendon.
    
    
                  
    
    Alexandra Shade '17 dropped down to the 400 to score some points for the Engineers and even though unseeded, she placed fourth in a best of 60.83.
    
    
                  
    
    Veronica Szklarzewski '15 rose to the occasion in the 100 meter dash. She was seeded fifth, but tied for second in a season best 11.52.
    
    
                  
    
    Over in the Hammer Throw, Ashley Weaver '15 and Ellen Liverpool '15 were battling it out for first place. Both threw PR's, but Weaver prevailed, throwing 157-0 to Liverpool's 154-10. Stuopis supported with a 136-4 PR for sixth place and Vahey earned seventh at 136-1.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 800, Gong did not win, but she ran a 2:16.74 second place to earn the votes necessary to win the NEWMAC Female Track Rookie of the meet.  Cindy Huang '15 added a fourth place and van den Heuvel a sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    Vahey added more points to the cause when she won the Discus at 128-2. Labaza added a third (120-1), Stuopis a fourth (112-10) and Wheeler a seventh (101-0).
    
    
                  
    
    In the 5K, Elaine McVay '15 needed to qualify for next week's championship and both Kaitlin Allen '14 and Nicole Zeinstra '16 wanted to improve their performances and place high. the pace was solid at 84 seconds per 400 as they hit 1600 splits of 5:37, 5:38 and 5:37. Both McVay and Allen let Danielle Opatovsky go at the end, but both accomplished their goal with McVay finishing second in 17:33.56 and Allen placing third in a PR of 17:33.93. Zeinstra faded at the end but ran a season best of 18:08.42 for sixth place.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event, the 4x400 Relay, the quartet of Shade, Wicker, Huang and Gong put together an amazing come from behind race to apparently win in 3:59. However, the unit was disqualified when Wicker cut across the track after handing off, interfering with the other runners. Shade ran 59.1 as leadoff, Wicker 60.9 despite her knee ailments, Huang a 59.6 and Gong a serious come from behind 60.4.
    
    
                  
    
    Despite the disqualification, the women pulled away to win comfortably with 224.33 points. Second place went to Wheaton College with 149.33, WPI was third with 100.83, Coast Guard fourth at 74.5, Springfield fifth with 70, Wellesley sixth with 63, Smith with 43, Mt. Holyoke eighth with 27 and Babson ninth with 23 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Going into the competition, the men expected to win their 14th consecutive NEWMAC title, having only lost the 2000 championship. However, Michael Kaba '16 (110HH, 400IH, 4x100) had to be pulled from the competition due to a muscle tightness that appeared the day before. Nick Diamantoni '15 (400, 200, 4x100) was pulled from competition after the 4x100 due to his hamstring feeling tight. With the Pole Vault and High Jump being moved indoors to the campus of Smith College, Adrian Samsel '16 had to be pulled from the High Jump. Jordan Mizerak '14 was not yet ready to return to competition in the Pole Vault as his hamstring has not yet healed enough for him to bring enough speed to his approach. This combination did not give the Engineers much leeway in securing a victory--everyone was going to have to step up.
    
    
                  
    
    The meet did not start off well for Tech. In addition to the injury status of the team, Wesley DeChristofaro of WPI, the only team with the potential to upset MIT, passed Carrington Motley '16 and Adrian Samsel '16 on the final attempt to knock them back to third and fourth in the Long Jump competition. Simultaneously, Alex Noakes '16, seeded fourth in the Hammer, placed sixth at 143-4. Despite Ken Cooper's '15 victory MIT lost six points (nine point swing) in the first two events.  Fortunately, on the track Matt McEachern '17 turned on the burners at the end of the 10K to move up from his sixth seed to place third in 32:27.37, supporting Brian Gilligan's '17 fifth place effort in 32:31.93, both personal bests.
    
    
                  
    
    While some of it was due to injury, overall the field events did not come through for MIT. Seeded to earn 138 points, only 89.5 were actually awarded. Perhaps the biggest letdown was in the Shot Put where Cooper and Noakes both fouled out after being seeded first and fourth respectively. The only field event that earned its keep was the Triple Jump where Angel Echevarria '16 and Motley went first and second with Echevarria winning in 45-9.
    
    
                  
    
    On the plus side for Tech's field events, Cooper threw a 165-11 in the Discus to win and move up to number two on the all-time MIT list and number seven on this year's NCAA Division III ranking. The combination of this and winning the Hammer Throw earned Cooper the NEWMAC Male Field Event Performer of the Meet. Also in the field events, Ian Perry '17 added to the Pole Vault points, earning fifth to join Ben Schreck '15 (2nd), and Marshall Wentworth '16 (6th) in scoring and in qualifying for the New England Division III Championship.
    
    
                  
    
    Fortunately, despite the loss of Kaba and Diamantoni, the running events scored only one less point than they were seeded. The only events affected on the negative side were those where the two injured runners would have competed.  To counter, the return of Tyler Singer-Clark '14 proved very big for MIT. The sprinter was held out of both relays, but he managed to qualify for the New England Division III Championship in both the 100 and 200 while scoring in both; earning third in the 100 in 11.23 and fourth in the 200 in 22.67.
    
    
                  
    
    States Lee '16 was the star for Tech, winning the 200 (22.22) and 400 (48.58) as well as running key legs on the winning 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams. For his efforts the sophomore was co-winner of the NEWMAC Male Track Athlete of the meet. 
    
    
                  
    
    Although behind WPI in scoring at that point in the meet, the 800 was a big event for MIT, pushing MIT into the lead. Harrison Hunter '15 and Sam Parker '15 finished 1-2 in 1:54.56 and 1:54.78 respectively. Rick Paez '15 pulled in four more points with a PR of 1:57.58.
    
    
                  
    
    Justin Bullock '14 won the 1500 after taking the pace out hard (61 first 400), relinquishing the lead and appearing to give up, only to come back and sprint past the leaders on the final backstretch to pull away in 3:56.40.  Matt Deyo '16 ran a seven second PR with his 3:59.88 fifth place finish.
    
    
                  
    
    Rory Beyer '17 pulled away in the final 600 meters to win the 3000 Steeplechase in a personal best of 9:34.90.  Kris Frey '15 supported with a PR of his own, placing fourth in 10:00.71.
    
    
                  
    
    The 400IH did not net a victory, but Samsel run a personal best 54.70 to place second, just edging out the second place at the line by .01. Gary Burnett '17 added a sixth place in 57.54, a season best.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 5K, not only did MIT need points, but Matt Jordan '15, Allen Leung '15 and Benji Xie '15 all still needed to qualify for next week's New England Division III Championship. They were in a difficult position because it was decided that if the number one seed, Gary Ezzo of Coast Guard, pushed the pace, they would not try to beat him, saving energy for next week's competition. Yet, they still needed to run sub 15:25 as well as score enough points to secure the victory. Fortunately, WPI had no serious scoring threats to worry about.  Roy Wedge '14, already qualified for next week's championship, was there to help his teammates and score some points if he did not have to work too hard. In the end everything worked out as Jordan placed second in 15:12.38, Leung earned third in 15:13.81 and Xie placed fifth to qualify for next week's championship. In addition, Wedge was sixth in 15:29.21.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event, the 4x400 Relay, MIT needed to secure a spot in the fast section of the 4x400 next weekend, and of course wanted a victory here. Pulling Hunter and Parker down from the 800 and adding Lee and Derek Barnes '16, who had earlier placed third in the 400 in 49.85 and eighth in the 200 in 22.91, the result was a 3:17.82 victory. MIT finished with 250.5 points to 212 for WPI, 147 for Coast Guard, 88.5 for Springfield, 53 for Wheaton and 20 for Babson.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, the men hope to piggyback on their New England Division III Indoor Track & Field victory and earn another title. The women hope to defend last year's title, but will certainly not be favored over a strong Williams College team.

    Vahey Sets Freshman Hammer Record at Sean Collier Invite
    
    
                  
    
    April 19, 2014
    
    
                  
    
    One year ago, when this meet, formerly called the MIT Spring Invite, was cancelled due to the shooting of MIT Officer Sean Collier and the safety concerns that followed, it was decided to rename the meet to honor Officer Collier. A total of 569 athletes from 37 teams and clubs entered the meet. The weather cooperated and the performances were excellent, putting the final touches on the renaming.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's team had sent a small handful of athletes to the Larry Ellis Invitational at Princeton and gave a few more time off to heal or recover for next week's NEWMAC conference championship. Of those who did compete many performed very well, setting personal bests as the regular season came to a close.
    
    
                  
    
    Leading the way for Tech was Jackie Vahey '17 who set the Freshman Hammer record of 141-6, a week after setting the Discus record. For the men, Carrington Motley '16 destroyed the field in the Triple Jump, adding a foot to his personal best in jumping 48-3 1/2, tying him for number three on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT had numerous victors at this meet, but only one individual had two wins and that was States Lee '16. The strong winds kept most oval performances down and this was also true for the 400 where Lee won in 49.04. He was able to come back in the 200 to win in 22.21, a victory that was not decided until Lee out-leaned Adam Julien from Emmanuel right at the line.
    
    
                  
    
    Rory Beyer '17 had a nice breakthrough in the 3000 Meter Steeplechase. With a previous best of 10:00, the freshman made a late charge to pull in the leader and then pulled away with a final 200 of 35, which includes a water jump and one other barrier to finish in 9:39.61. Teammate Kris Frey '15 also set a PR, running 10:01.21
    
    
                  
    
    Rick Paez '15, running out of the second fastest section of the 800, won the race with a huge PR of 1:57.77, beating everyone in the fast section as well. Dominique Hoskin '15 ran a personal best of 2:00.89 and Henry Tareque '17 made his 800 debut, running a very strong race in 2:01.31.
    
    
                  
    
    While he did not win, senior Michael DuPlessis, who has been coming back from injury after injury, did what he does each year, getting it done at championship time. DuPlessis finished third in the 100 in 11.09.
    
    
                  
    
    Although he did not win an event, Ken Cooper '15 claimed three second place finishes, taking runner-up in the Hammer, Discus and Shot Put. He just missed his personal best in the Hammer, throwing 187-6, which moves him to number eight on the NCAA list. Alex Noakes '16 did have a personal best, throwing 150-9.
    
    
                  
    
    Harry Rein '15 threw a personal best in the Javelin for the second week in a row, this one good for second place at 188-0. His new mark puts him number 10 on MIT's top 10 all-time list.
    
    
                  
    
    Ben Schreck '15 lost a jump-off in the Pole Vault, but did clear 15-9 prior to that to put himself at number 13 on the NCAA qualifying list.
    
    
                  
    
    Matt Deyo '16 ran a personal best in the 5K with a 15:07.12 effort. The plan was to just run fast enough to run sub 15:15, a time that should guarantee a spot in the fast section of the New England Division III Championship 5K in two weeks. However, BJ Pierce from Franklin Pierce College ran much faster than his seed, hammering out a fast pace and then out-kicking Deyo for the win in 15:03. Deyo and teammate Matt Jordan '15 were not expecting a race. Deyo dealt with it pretty well while Jordan did not, fading to 15:32.56.
    
    
                  
    
    Cimmy Virdi '16 won the Pole Vault as expected, clearing 11-11 3/4, but was unable to make a higher height. Abby Klein '14 set a personal best, clearing 11-5 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Ashley Wheeler '15 did not set a personal best, but she threw well, winning the Hammer Throw with a distance of 150-6. Also in the throws, Tilly Taylor '15 threw a season best of 135-7 to move up to number 12 on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    In the running events, Martina de Geus '14 continued her comeback, winning the 3000 Meter Steeplechase in 11:18.14. Her final 200 of 37 seconds shows she had a lot left as her pace had been between 90-95 seconds for all but the first 400.
    
    
                  
    
    Christina Wicker '17 had the only other victory for the Engineers. Her 4:43.70 in the 1500 was a personal best and her negative split finish shows a lot of promise.
    
    
                  
    
    Veronica Szklarzewski '15 had an excellent meet. First she took second in the Long Jump with a 17-4 3/4 jump, moving her up to number four on the all-time MIT list. She then took second in the 100, running a season best 12.62.
    
    
                  
    
    The women appear to be in pretty good position to defend their NEWMAC title next weekend and then make a run at defending their New England Division III title the following week. The men hope to continue the NEWMAC Conference win streak alive, having not lost since 2000. Although they lost the New England Division III title by one point last year, the Engineers hope to make it back to back championships, having won indoors a few weeks ago.

    OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCES DAMPENED BY INJURIES DURING SPRING TRIP
    
    
                  
    
    March 29, 2014
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Track and Field teams traveled to Claremont, California for a week of warm weather training during MIT's Spring Break week. After five days of practices at Claremont McKenna, the teams traveled to Westmont College in Santa Barbara for the Westmont Invitational, a non-scoring meet with host Westmont, George Fox, Fresno Pacific, Santa Barbara Track Club, the France CE Team (primarily made up of multi-event athletes) and a few unattached performers.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT dominated many events at the meet despite only bringing 16 for each gender, primarily those in technical events. The women won five events as well as setting a varsity record and a freshman record. The men won nine events, led by Ken Cooper '15 who won three of them and Michael Kaba '16 and States Lee '16 who won two others after combining their skills to play a part in the 4x100 Relay victory.
    
    
                  
    
    Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 placed third in the High Jump, clearing 5-05 to set a new MIT record, leading the MIT performances for the women. Jackie Vahey '17 put herself on three MIT top ten lists; fifth on the Shot Put list at 38-3 1/2, ninth on the Hammer list at 131-6 and fifth on the Discus list, setting a new freshman record at 126-4.
    
    
                  
    
    Jackie Brew '14 played a role in three MIT victories. The first was running the leadoff leg in the 4x100 Relay, along with Veronica Szklarzewski '15, Kendra Knittel, and Stephanie Birkhimer '14 to win in 48.59. She also won the 100HH in a PR of 14.87 and the 200 Meter Dash in 25.94.
    
    
                  
    
    Christina Wicker '17 turned her debut in the 3000 Meter Steeplechase into an 11:53.22 victory. Cimmy Virdi led an MIT domination in the Pole Vault, winning with a vault of 12-0.
    
    
                  
    
    For the men, Ken Cooper '15 won the Hammer Throw, Discus Throw and Shot Put as he showcased his considerable talents. The most impressive of his victories was in the Discus where he threw 162-11, moving him to number three on the all-time MIT list. In the Shot, Cooper threw 52-6 1/2 to lead all throwers, and in the Hammer he threw 161-5 to easily win the event.
    
    
                  
    
    Michael Kaba '16 started his day running the second leg on the winning 4x100 Relay team, joining States Lee '16, Taylor Njaka '17 and Tyler Singer-Clark '14 in running 41.98, an excellent time for the first meet of the year. Kaba then claimed victory in the 110HH in 15.06, an event he rarely gets to practice. He ended his day  winning the 400IH in a come-from-behind 54.10 victory.
    
    
                  
    
    Njaka added the 100 Meter Dash to his victory resume, sprinting an 11.19 into a slight headwind. Singer-Clark, who was closing ground fast on Njaka, pulled up with an injured hamstring in the final 20 meters, still earning fourth place in 11.71.
    
    
                  
    
    States Lee '16 won the 400 in a personal best of 48.09, a time that is very likely fast enough to get him to the NCAA Championship in two months. He later returned to the track to win the 200 into a headwind, running 22.50.
    
    
                  
    
    The injury to Singer-Clark was added to Nick Diamantoni '15 pulling his hamstring at Wednesday's practice and Stephanie Guo's '17 IT band /patella-femoral injury. The hope is that all will be ready to return to competition soon.
    
    
                  
    
    Next weekend, MIT will take full teams to Troy, NY, home of RPI, the host of this year's Engineer's Cup, an annual triangular meet between MIT, RPI and WPI.
