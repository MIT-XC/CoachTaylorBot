  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT CLAIMS FIRST IN ENGINEER'S CUP</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 9, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">With 24 different scorers, MIT made up for last year's aberration 
    of a loss to RPI in the Engineer's Cup by claiming a 184 to 150 victory while 
    WPI scored 62 points for third place. MIT demonstrated great balance by outscoring 
    both of their opponents combined in nine events, winning 11 of them despite 
    Nate Ball not competing in the pole vault and Uzoma Orji, who won the shot 
    put and hammer throw, fouling out of the discus.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina led the scoring with 18 3/4 points. Traina's best 
    event, the 200 meter dash, made up for a loss in the 100 to Kemar Brown of 
    RPI, who ran 10.71, although the race was decided by .004 as Traina won in 
    21.86. Traina also anchored the 400 relay to victory, making up 10 meters 
    on the final leg, leading off the second place 4x400 with a 50.2 leg and claiming 
    third in the high jump with a 5-08 effort.</p>
  <p align="left">Claiming two victories each were Orji and Brian Anderson in 
    the 1500 and 800. Anderson is slowly returning to form after taking nearly 
    a year off of running to allow his hamstring injury heal. Anderson's times 
    of 4:01.69 and 1:57.19 were quite good for this time of year. He also ran 
    the second leg of the 1600 relay in 52.1. Orji's performances were 180-02 
    in the hammer for a personal best and 54-5 in the shot put.</p>
  <p align="left">Ben Schmeckpeper won the steeplechase in 9:38.93 for his first 
    effort of the season. Schmeckpeper also returned in the 800 to claim fourth 
    in 2:02.16. Other victories were earned by Nestor Hernandez in the long jump 
    with a 20-9 1/4 performance, Omari Stephens in the 110HH with a personal best 
    of 16.27, Kenny Rosche in the 400 in 51.05 and Chris Wong in the 5000, running 
    down teammate Kevin Brulois with a vicious 34 second final 200.</p>
  <p align="left">With their outdoor record at 18-1, MIT travels to Bates College 
    next Saturday to go against Bates, Colby College and the University of Southern 
    Maine for the final scoring regular season meet. While Bates has not defeated 
    MIT in a regular season meet since 1983 they have narrowly defeated MIT in 
    the past three indoor and outdoor New England Division III Championships.</p>
