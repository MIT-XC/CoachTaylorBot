  <p><strong><font size="+2">TECH OUTPERFORMS SEEDS TO EARN SECOND PLACE IN NEW 
    ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 7, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji led the MIT Engineers to second place in the New 
    England Division III Championship this weekend by winning the hammer throw 
    and shot put and finishing sixth in the discus. MIT scored 99.5 points to 
    167.5 for Williams and 72.5 for Bates College among the 26 scoring teams.</p>
  <p align="left">Tech had two other winners on this rainy and windy day. Eric 
    Khatchadourian kicked things off with an outstanding victory in the 10K with 
    a time of 32:44.10. With three miles to go Khatchadourian pulled away by going 
    from a casual 5:21 pace per mile for a 16:25 first three miles, to 5:08 pace 
    to pull away and win by nine seconds. The other victory was just as impressive. 
    Brian Anderson, continuing his comeback, ran just the 800. The challenge to 
    Anderson was that he was seeded 16th and forced to run from the slower section, 
    which ran before the fast section. Despite the strong winds and rain, Anderson 
    went out in 53.2 for the first 400. This was a little faster than the race 
    plan but he did not want anyone drafting off of him. Anderson held on to run 
    1:54.29. Then it was a waiting game to see what the fast section would do. 
    Foolishly, the leaders came through the first quarter in 58, virtually guaranteeing 
    the victory for Anderson. The best they could do was finish in 1:57, giving 
    Anderson the win.</p>
  <p align="left">At the same time Khatchadourian was winning the 10K, Orji and 
    David Saylor were busy scoring points in the hammer. Saylor opened with a 
    personal best throw of 177-2 to take the lead. On his third throw, Orji passed 
    Saylor with a personal best of his own at 182-6. No one was able to pass them 
    with the wet circle, giving MIT 18 more points.</p>
  <p align="left">It was at this point that things slowed down for MIT. In the 
    pole vault, favored, Nate Ball injured his healthy hamstring during the warmup. 
    Neither Omari Stephens nor Nestor Hernandez were able to match their bests 
    for the season, in part due to the erratic, but strong cross-winds, but they 
    did manage a tie for sixth and a third respectively. Favored to score 16 points 
    in the event, MIT was fortunate to come out with eight and a half.</p>
  <p align="left">In the long jump and triple jump, Hernandez and Makinde Adeagbo, 
    not seeded to score, were not able to improve on their seeds and score some 
    much needed points and MIT had no entries in the high jump or javelin. This 
    meant only the discus and shot put remained among the field events with MIT 
    having only scored 26.5 points.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's woes continued as Orji, seeded fourth in the discus, could 
    not produce a big throw. Orji settled for sixth place with a throw of 142-11. 
    On the track, the 400 relay, seeded third, had to be thankful for a fourth 
    place in 42.86. David Blau had a great start and was in the lead at the first 
    exchange to Kenny Rosche. At the second handoff, Jonathan Hsieh came to a 
    near stop as they approached the end of the zone. At the final exchange Traina 
    was at championship speed and totally left Hsieh, having to slow down and 
    turn around to get the baton to guarantee a legal handoff. Traina blistered 
    the final leg to get the team fourth. Continuing with the unfortunate downward 
    spiral, Ben Schmeckpeper was not able to show the strong form he had last 
    week, and gave up time at every barrier as he stuttered and dropped his hips 
    while hurdling. Schmeckpeper was able to hang onto fifth in 9:22.92, but he 
    was seeded second and planning on winning the race.</p>
  <p align="left">It was at this point where things turned back in MIT's favor. 
    In the 1500, John Brewer, seeded 20th, ran a personal best to win the slow 
    section in 4:00.53, despite the wind and rain, to place seventh overall. Traina 
    and Blau, qualifying for the finals of the 100 earlier in the day, finished 
    2-4 in 10.92 (10.87 in the trials) and 11.04 (personal best) respectively.</p>
  <p align="left">After Anderson stepped up to win the 800, Orji stepped into 
    the shot put ring and easily won his specialty in 53-3 3/4. Chris Desrochers, 
    seeded 16th in the 400IH, won the first of three sections in a personal best 
    of 57.51 to secure eighth place as others were totally thrown off by the wind.</p>
  <p align="left">This set up the return of Traina and Blau, this time in the 
    200. Drawing lanes three and one respectively, both were at a severe disadvantage 
    to those in the outside lanes, particularly with the wind hitting them in 
    the face at the start. Nevertheless, both ran personal bests, with Traina 
    placing second in a nationally qualifying, and MIT record of 21.53 and Blau 
    running 22.47 for sixth.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's final event was the 1600 relay. MIT was hoping to run 
    a season best but the wind picked up and the rain started coming down hard 
    to end those dreams. Traina led things off with a 51.4 leg, slowed in part 
    due to the fact he was in lane seven for the start of the three turn stagger 
    and did not have much of an idea of how to pace. Rosche took the handoff and 
    ran 50.6 to give MIT the lead. Jesse Collins ran the third leg in 52.1, putting 
    MIT in third as the baton came to Anderson. He was not able to hold off the 
    closing teams, finishing with a 52.1 anchor, which dropped MIT to fifth in 
    3:26.40</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT will split their squad between two meets. The 
    IC4A meet hosted by Princeton, which is also the Division I Regional Qualifying 
    meet, has moved their date forward a week and now conflicts with the All New 
    Englands. </p>
