  <p><strong><font size="+3">ORJI AND BALL LEADS MIT EFFORT AT NATIONALS</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="+3">Engineers Place 12th With 21 Points</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 26-28, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">Nate Ball entered the NCAA Championships having pulled both 
    his hamstrings since his personal best and school record vault of 16-8 3/4. 
    Since his second pull four weeks ago, Ball has not vaulted, trusting that 
    the rehabilitative process without vaulting would put him in the best position 
    to vault when it counted. With the warmup going well, Ball decided to come 
    in at the second height, 15-3 1/2, which he cleared easily on his first attempt. 
    Two vaulters went out at this height and two at the previous height, dropping 
    the original field of 17 down to 13. At the next height, Ball cleared comfortably 
    on his second attempt and three more vaulters were eliminated. The height 
    now went up 10 cm. instead of the earlier 15cm. to bring the bar to 16-3 1/4. 
    Ball had no problem with this height, clearing on his first attempt. Many 
    others aslo had difficulty at the height as five more fouled out, bringing 
    the field down to five competitors. At this point Ball was tied for the lead. 
    At 16-7 1/4 Ball had difficulty, but responded well to the crowd's clapping 
    and cleared on his third attempt. The indoor champion fouled out but the other 
    three cleared, two of them on the first or second attempt to put them ahead 
    of ball. The first attempt at 16-11 caused Ball's hamstring to seize up. His 
    final two attempts were not his best efforts due to his cramping hamstring. 
    Two vaulters cleared 16-11, one of them being the vaulter Ball was ahead of, 
    who won the event by clearing on his first attempt. Ball's effort was a tremendous 
    display of athleticism and human spirit and a very proud moment for MIT track 
    and field.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina was in the 200, running in lane 8 in the first heat. 
    It was Traina's first time at the NCAA Championship, and possibly had him 
    a little intimidated. While he had a pretty good start, he was not running 
    fast until the field moved past him at the end of the curve. Too little, too 
    late, put Traina at the finish line in 22.34, placing him 14th out of 17 entrants.</p>
  <p align="left">The shot put led off competition on day two. Uzoma Orji, seeded 
    sixth, was out to improve on that seed. He warmed up with standing throws 
    around the 52' mark, a good sign. Orji's was the first thrower in the competition 
    and started with a 54-8 3/4 safety throw, one good enough to lead the first 
    round in the first flight. His second throw was a season best of 57-4 1/4, 
    the best of the first flight. In the second flight, the number two seed, Nate 
    Meckes from Calvin College, threw one within 10 cm. behind Orji. The number 
    one seed, and defending national champion, Cody Brotherton from McMurry University, 
    threw one 59-9 1/2. Orji was in second but not by much. In the finals, on 
    his fourth throw, the third seed, Brandon Houle of the University of Wisconsin 
    Oshkosh, popped one 58-2 1/2 to move into second. Orji did not produce a big 
    throw on his fourth effort, but blasted a 58-3 effort on his fifth to move 
    back into second by 1 cm. Meckes also improved to 57-9 to tighten things up. 
    Brotherton put on 60-4 1/4 to take a big lead. No one improved in the final 
    round although Orji certainly gave it his inspired best. Orji's second place 
    gave MIT a total of 13 points after two days of competition.</p>
  <p align="left">The men's hammer throw began the competition on the final day 
    of the championship and Orji appeared ready to go. His warmups looked solid, 
    so even though he was seeded seventh at 188-8, he was confident he would place 
    well. Throwing last in the first flight, Orji threw a solid 184-8 to stand 
    in second in his flight. He was pulling the hammer slightly and did not tighten 
    his final turn, so there was something to look forward to. In the second round, 
    Jacob Gabrilska from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosk improved his lead, 
    but Orji came back with a 186-3 to take the lead. In the third round, Orji 
    improved to 187-8 while two throwers whose best was over 190 did not throw 
    well enough to make the finals and another 190+ thrower only threw 184-1.</p>
  <p align="left">Only the number one seed, Kevin Becker of the University of 
    Wisconsin Lacrosse, passed Orji in the second flight, throwing 202-8. Another 
    190' thrower did not make the finals and the number two seed, Brandon Houle 
    of the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, only threw 180-9. In the finals, Orji 
    came out firing and launched a 189-2 personal best to expand his hold on second 
    place. Only one place changed hands in the finals as no one gave serious threat 
    to catching Orji. Trying to go for a big throw on his final effort, he straightened 
    up too early, did not counter and the hammer hit the circle, cutting his distance 
    severely. Moving from seventh seed to finish in second with five throws over 
    184' was by far his best day ever in the hammer.</p>
  <p align="left">The final event for MIT was the 5000 meter race. Ben Schmeckpeper, 
    seeded 17th, was hoping to add to his cross country All America honors by 
    placing in the top eight in the elite field. The pace was pedestrian as the 
    first 400 was 75 seconds. Mike Vidumsky, the 19th and final seed, took the 
    lead, opening up an 80 meter lead by the mile mark as the pack continued the 
    slow pace of 4:57. The pace then picked up with a series of sub 70 second 
    laps. Schmeckpeper, who was running flat and back on his heels during the 
    slow first mile, was not able to accelerate with the pack during the second 
    mile and began to fall back. Even though his second mile was a 4:41, a normal 
    pace for this event, he fell back to near the back of the pack. As the pack 
    swallowed up Vidumsky, Schmeckpeper slowed to a 4:58 third mile. The race 
    became a two man sprint in the final 400 between 10K champion, Josh Moen of 
    Wartburg College and 10K runner-up, Macharia Yuot, from Widener College. Moen 
    held Yuot off to win his third NCAA Championship of the year (cross country, 
    outdoor 10K and 5K). Schmeckpeper finished in 15th in 15:09.84.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT placed 12th with 21 points, their highest point total in 
    over a decade.</p>
