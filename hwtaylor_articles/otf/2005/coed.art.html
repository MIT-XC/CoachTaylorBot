  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT Fine Tunes For Championships at Home Invitational</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 23, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">MIT hosted an invitational today with the goal of resting some 
    athletes, fine tuning others by having them run shorter races than usual, 
    exploring optional events for a few and overall preparing for the upcoming 
    series of championships beginning with the NEWMAC Championship on April 30. 
    By all accounts, the goals were successfully met as numerous personal and 
    season bests were established and championship standards were met. So far, 
    MIT has qualified 19 different athletes for the New England Division III Championships 
    and seven for the all New Englands.</p>
  <p align="left">Despite the cool temperatures in the 50s, the off and on rain 
    and the wind, which began blowing from the east and ended up blowing in from 
    the west, reaching extremely high gusts during the 400IH, 800 and 200 meter 
    races, MIT athletes endured, showing the character it takes to win championships. 
    The rain forced two events indoors due to safety considerations, the pole 
    vault and high jump. The availability of the adjacent indoor facility with 
    a separate set of pits makes MIT an ideal place to hold meets in the spring 
    when unpredictable weather seems to be the norm.</p>
  <p align="left">The vaulters did not have the wind at their back but they nevertheless 
    took advantage of being dry and supplied one season and one personal best. 
    Nestor Hernandez placed third behind teammate Nate Ball at 15-6 and a Fitchburg 
    State vaulter, with a leap of 14-0. Following close behind, Omari Stephens 
    cleared a personal best of 13-6. Stephens backed up his vaulting PR with another 
    PR when he won the110HH in 16.09.</p>
  <p align="left">Tom Hoover, coming back to jump after nearly two years since 
    he was last healthy and jumping well, showed signs of returning to his old 
    form by jumping 20-1 1/2 in the long jump and 5-10 in the high jump.</p>
  <p align="left">While the wet circles generally kept the outstanding performances 
    to a minimum, David Saylor moved up in the national rankings with his hammer 
    throw of 170-4 to place second behind teammate Uzoma Orji, who won with a 
    throw of 173-7 to add to his other victories in the shot put and discus throw.</p>
  <p align="left">David Blau continued to improve each meet as he ran an excellent 
    leadoff leg on the 4x100 to start the team off to victory with a 42.99 effort. 
    He followed that up with a season best of 11.17 into a light wind as the wind 
    changed directions just prior to the event. MIT had made the decision to utilize 
    their multiple Finish Lynx cameras and ability to run the sprints in either 
    direction to take advantage of the tailwind. However, when the wind switched 
    directions it was too late to change the 100.</p>
  <p align="left">Kenny Rosche did not let the strong winds that were building 
    during the 400 affect his race as he ran to a season best victory in 50.57. 
    Rosche also anchored the winning 4x400 team with a 50.7 leg to finish in 3:25.41. 
    In addition, he ran a strong second leg in the 4x100.</p>
  <p align="left">Brian Anderson continued his comeback with a superb effort in 
    the 800, going out in gale force winds with a 56 opening 400 and finishing 
    in a season best start to finish victory in 1:56.36. Anderson supported the 
    4x400 relay with a 51.3 leg.</p>
  <p align="left">In the 5000, Erik Stafl ran his first 3.1 mile track race with 
    an excellent15:51.15 performance. Joe Roy-Mayhew may have found his event 
    as he too debuted with a great time of 16:11.36. The two freshmen had been 
    running the 1500 earlier this season but seemed much more at home in the longer 
    race.</p>
  <p align="left">Next Saturday, when MIT travels to WPI for the NEWMAC Championship, 
    an event they have won the past four years as well as five of the six years 
    the meet has been held, they hope to engrave another year on the traveling 
    trophy that has made its home in Cambridge.</p>
