    April 23, 2005
    
    
      
    
    MIT hosted an invitational today with the goal of resting some 
        athletes, fine tuning others by having them run shorter races than usual, 
        exploring optional events for a few and overall preparing for the upcoming 
        series of championships beginning with the NEWMAC Championship on April 30. 
        By all accounts, the goals were successfully met as numerous personal and 
        season bests were established and championship standards were met. So far, 
        MIT has qualified 19 different athletes for the New England Division III Championships 
        and seven for the all New Englands.
    
    
      
    
    Despite the cool temperatures in the 50s, the off and on rain 
        and the wind, which began blowing from the east and ended up blowing in from 
        the west, reaching extremely high gusts during the 400IH, 800 and 200 meter 
        races, MIT athletes endured, showing the character it takes to win championships. 
        The rain forced two events indoors due to safety considerations, the pole 
        vault and high jump. The availability of the adjacent indoor facility with 
        a separate set of pits makes MIT an ideal place to hold meets in the spring 
        when unpredictable weather seems to be the norm.
    
    
      
    
    The vaulters did not have the wind at their back but they nevertheless 
        took advantage of being dry and supplied one season and one personal best. 
        Nestor Hernandez placed third behind teammate Nate Ball at 15-6 and a Fitchburg 
        State vaulter, with a leap of 14-0. Following close behind, Omari Stephens 
        cleared a personal best of 13-6. Stephens backed up his vaulting PR with another 
        PR when he won the110HH in 16.09.
    
    
      
    
    Tom Hoover, coming back to jump after nearly two years since 
        he was last healthy and jumping well, showed signs of returning to his old 
        form by jumping 20-1 1/2 in the long jump and 5-10 in the high jump.
    
    
      
    
    While the wet circles generally kept the outstanding performances 
        to a minimum, David Saylor moved up in the national rankings with his hammer 
        throw of 170-4 to place second behind teammate Uzoma Orji, who won with a 
        throw of 173-7 to add to his other victories in the shot put and discus throw.
    
    
      
    
    David Blau continued to improve each meet as he ran an excellent 
        leadoff leg on the 4x100 to start the team off to victory with a 42.99 effort. 
        He followed that up with a season best of 11.17 into a light wind as the wind 
        changed directions just prior to the event. MIT had made the decision to utilize 
        their multiple Finish Lynx cameras and ability to run the sprints in either 
        direction to take advantage of the tailwind. However, when the wind switched 
        directions it was too late to change the 100.
    
    
      
    
    Kenny Rosche did not let the strong winds that were building 
        during the 400 affect his race as he ran to a season best victory in 50.57. 
        Rosche also anchored the winning 4x400 team with a 50.7 leg to finish in 3:25.41. 
        In addition, he ran a strong second leg in the 4x100.
    
    
      
    
    Brian Anderson continued his comeback with a superb effort in 
        the 800, going out in gale force winds with a 56 opening 400 and finishing 
        in a season best start to finish victory in 1:56.36. Anderson supported the 
        4x400 relay with a 51.3 leg.
    
    
      
    
    In the 5000, Erik Stafl ran his first 3.1 mile track race with 
        an excellent15:51.15 performance. Joe Roy-Mayhew may have found his event 
        as he too debuted with a great time of 16:11.36. The two freshmen had been 
        running the 1500 earlier this season but seemed much more at home in the longer 
        race.
    
    
      
    
    Next Saturday, when MIT travels to WPI for the NEWMAC Championship, 
        an event they have won the past four years as well as five of the six years 
        the meet has been held, they hope to engrave another year on the traveling 
        trophy that has made its home in Cambridge.

    **ENGINEEERS PLACE 5TH WITH FIVE ATHLETS AT ECAC DIVISION 
        III CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    May 20, 2005
    
    
      
    
    MIT made the trip to the ECAC Division III Championship being 
        hosted by Springfield College with only five of the athletes who had qualified. 
        The ECAC Division III Championship for most teams is simply a last chance 
        qualifier. Due to the fact that it is during exam week, and it being an easier 
        meet than the IC4A or All New Englands being held the previous weekend, it 
        makes little sense to bring back athletes who are not trying to meet the NCAA 
        championship qualifying standard. Even though MIT has six athletes who are 
        at least provisionally qualified for nationals, only four of them made the 
        trip to Springfield, while Nate Ball and Ben Schmeckpeper stayed home. The 
        four NCAA qualifiers who competed, Brian Anderson, Uzoma Orji, David Saylor 
        and Zach Traina, joined David Blau in an attempt to improve their best performances 
        this season. All five athletes placed in each event they participated in, 
        scoring a total of 33 1/2 points for fifth place.
    
    
      
    
    The first event of the day was the hammer throw. Orji and Saylor 
        were seeded second and fourth. Saylor needed to improve his mark of 176-8 
        in order to make the field for the NCAA Championship. On his last throw of 
        the trials, Saylor threw a personal best of 177-7, which placed him fourth 
        overall. Orji waited until the first throw of the finals to get his personal 
        best, a toss of 188-8, good enough for the victory. Saylor passed one person 
        on the national list and tied another, although another competitor in the 
        field passed him.
    
    
      
    
    In the 100, Blau, seeded 11th, qualified for the finals with 
        a 11.08 time in the trials. In the finals he did not have his best race but 
        still ran 11.16, good for eighth place. Later, Blau returned to the track 
        in the 200 along with teammate Traina. Blau, seeded 13th, was in the next 
        to last section and placed third in that section and tied for eighth overall 
        with a remarkable time of 22.32 into the wind. While the performance does 
        not match his PR of 22.16 run last week, that time was done with a significant 
        tailwind. The 22.32 is his second best time ever and his most impressive. 
        Traina did not get out very well and only managed to place sixth overall with 
        a 22.19.
    
    
      
    
    Anderson, hoping to improve on his 1:52.84 run at the IC4A Championship, 
        was planning on going out in 55 for the first quarter and continue to push 
        the pace. The plan could not have gone any better for the first 600 meters. 
        Anderson went out in 55 even at the 400 having just taken the lead. The third 
        200 was perhaps a little fast, running 27 flat to come through 600 in 1:22. 
        Anderson did not have it on this particular day and faded down the homestretch. 
        He did finish in 1:54.77, and now he has to hope that his 1:52 will get him 
        into the national championship.
    
    
      
    
    Orji was the last to compete, coming back in the shot put. With 
        no serious threats, Orji had to depend on his own motivation to see if he 
        could improve on last week's 57-3 put. Orji started with a 54 foot put and 
        came back with a 55-3 1/2 on his second throw. His form was great up to the 
        power position but flat in the delivery. He is currently ranked sixth in the 
        shot put and seventh in the hammer throw.
    
    
      
    
    The Engineers will find out Monday night who gets in to the 
        NCAA Championship and who does not. Those who are in will fly to Wartburg 
        College in Waverly, Iowa on Tuesday to compete Thursday through Saturday.

    **MIT CLAIMS FIRST IN ENGINEER'S CUP**
    
    
      
    
    April 9, 2005
    
    
      
    
    With 24 different scorers, MIT made up for last year's aberration 
        of a loss to RPI in the Engineer's Cup by claiming a 184 to 150 victory while 
        WPI scored 62 points for third place. MIT demonstrated great balance by outscoring 
        both of their opponents combined in nine events, winning 11 of them despite 
        Nate Ball not competing in the pole vault and Uzoma Orji, who won the shot 
        put and hammer throw, fouling out of the discus.
    
    
      
    
    Zach Traina led the scoring with 18 3/4 points. Traina's best 
        event, the 200 meter dash, made up for a loss in the 100 to Kemar Brown of 
        RPI, who ran 10.71, although the race was decided by .004 as Traina won in 
        21.86. Traina also anchored the 400 relay to victory, making up 10 meters 
        on the final leg, leading off the second place 4x400 with a 50.2 leg and claiming 
        third in the high jump with a 5-08 effort.
    
    
      
    
    Claiming two victories each were Orji and Brian Anderson in 
        the 1500 and 800. Anderson is slowly returning to form after taking nearly 
        a year off of running to allow his hamstring injury heal. Anderson's times 
        of 4:01.69 and 1:57.19 were quite good for this time of year. He also ran 
        the second leg of the 1600 relay in 52.1. Orji's performances were 180-02 
        in the hammer for a personal best and 54-5 in the shot put.
    
    
      
    
    Ben Schmeckpeper won the steeplechase in 9:38.93 for his first 
        effort of the season. Schmeckpeper also returned in the 800 to claim fourth 
        in 2:02.16. Other victories were earned by Nestor Hernandez in the long jump 
        with a 20-9 1/4 performance, Omari Stephens in the 110HH with a personal best 
        of 16.27, Kenny Rosche in the 400 in 51.05 and Chris Wong in the 5000, running 
        down teammate Kevin Brulois with a vicious 34 second final 200.
    
    
      
    
    With their outdoor record at 18-1, MIT travels to Bates College 
        next Saturday to go against Bates, Colby College and the University of Southern 
        Maine for the final scoring regular season meet. While Bates has not defeated 
        MIT in a regular season meet since 1983 they have narrowly defeated MIT in 
        the past three indoor and outdoor New England Division III Championships.

    **MIT PREPARES FOR NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH END OF SEASON 
        PERSONAL BESTS**
    
    
      
    
    May 15, 2005
    
    
      
    
    Due to the conflict with having two prestigious championships 
        on the same weekend, MIT split their squad between the All New England Championship 
        (NEICAAA) hosted by the University of New Hampshire and the IC4A Championship 
        held at Princeton University. The Engineers left home some qualifiers who 
        could have scored so they could focus on their exams that start on Monday, 
        taking only those who were preparing for, or hoping to qualify for, the NCAA 
        Championship.
    
    
      
    
    At UNH, only David Blau and David Saylor made the trip and both 
        made the most of their opportunity. David Blau ran two personal bests in the 
        100 and 200 meter sprints. In the 100, Blau ran 11.00 to move to fifth on 
        the all time MIT list. With a short rest, Blau came back in the 200, running 
        22.16, dropping over three tenths of a second off his personal best.
    
    
      
    
    David Saylor did not throw a personal best in the hammer throw, 
        but he only missed doing so by six inches. What he did do was finish fourth 
        to score five points for MIT.
    
    
      
    
    Down at Princeton, Ben Schmeckpeper got things rolling with 
        a 5000 personal best and national qualifying time of 14:37.58. The time moved 
        Ben to number six on the all-time MIT list. Ben ran a smart race, pacing it 
        well through two miles. The first mile was 4:37 and the second mile 4:41 as 
        things began to string out in the back of the pack. At the end of the second 
        mile Schmeckpeper slowed to 72-73 for four laps before picking it up to a 
        71 on the next quarter and finishing with a 31 final 200. He obviously finished 
        with too much left but in that third mile he did not feel he could go any 
        faster. Nevertheless, the time puts him at number 12 among the NCAA Division 
        III qualifiers.
    
    
      
    
    Brian Anderson was next to test his skills against the best 
        Division I 800 runners on the east coast. Anderson, sick with a head cold, 
        went out in the middle of the pack and looked good until he got spiked on 
        the front of the leg at the end of the first 200. A lot of jostling for position 
        caused Anderson to alter his stride a few times in the first quarter, which 
        was 54.0 for the MIT graduate student. At the 600 mark Anderson second guessed 
        himself and missed an opportunity to move up in the pack. Anderson faded in 
        the homestretch but still managed an outdoor track personal best and national 
        qualifying mark of 1:52.84. The performance moved Anderson to number four 
        on the MIT 800 list and number 10 among the NCAA Division III qualifiers.
    
    
      
    
    Zach Traina took his turn on the track in the 200 meter dash. 
        Getting the inside lane, Traina got out well and ran a solid race but was 
        unable to improve on his 21.53 mark as he finished in 22.10.
    
    
      
    
    Uzoma Orji, entered in both the hammer and shot put, started 
        with the hammer throw. Orji looked good in warmups, landing a couple in the 
        185 foot area. However, in the competition he was unable to achieve the same 
        distance as he struggled with being aggressive and achieving fast turns. Orji 
        managed a good series but his farthest throw was only 178-6, not good enough 
        to make finals.
    
    
      
    
    In the shot put, Orji had his best performance of the season 
        and best series of the year. All six throws were between 55-2 1/4 and 57-3. 
        His performance earned him a fourth place finish and owner of all five points 
        for MIT.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, on Thursday and Friday, MIT heads back to Springfield 
        College for the ECAC Division III Championship. This meet is in essence a 
        last chance qualifier rather than a championship for MIT. Only those with 
        a chance at the NCAA Division III Championships will be making the trip, which 
        are being held at the same time as final exams for MIT.

    **Engineers Place 12th With 21 Points**
    
    
      
    
    May 26-28, 2005
    
    
      
    
    Nate Ball entered the NCAA Championships having pulled both 
        his hamstrings since his personal best and school record vault of 16-8 3/4. 
        Since his second pull four weeks ago, Ball has not vaulted, trusting that 
        the rehabilitative process without vaulting would put him in the best position 
        to vault when it counted. With the warmup going well, Ball decided to come 
        in at the second height, 15-3 1/2, which he cleared easily on his first attempt. 
        Two vaulters went out at this height and two at the previous height, dropping 
        the original field of 17 down to 13. At the next height, Ball cleared comfortably 
        on his second attempt and three more vaulters were eliminated. The height 
        now went up 10 cm. instead of the earlier 15cm. to bring the bar to 16-3 1/4. 
        Ball had no problem with this height, clearing on his first attempt. Many 
        others aslo had difficulty at the height as five more fouled out, bringing 
        the field down to five competitors. At this point Ball was tied for the lead. 
        At 16-7 1/4 Ball had difficulty, but responded well to the crowd's clapping 
        and cleared on his third attempt. The indoor champion fouled out but the other 
        three cleared, two of them on the first or second attempt to put them ahead 
        of ball. The first attempt at 16-11 caused Ball's hamstring to seize up. His 
        final two attempts were not his best efforts due to his cramping hamstring. 
        Two vaulters cleared 16-11, one of them being the vaulter Ball was ahead of, 
        who won the event by clearing on his first attempt. Ball's effort was a tremendous 
        display of athleticism and human spirit and a very proud moment for MIT track 
        and field.
    
    
      
    
    Zach Traina was in the 200, running in lane 8 in the first heat. 
        It was Traina's first time at the NCAA Championship, and possibly had him 
        a little intimidated. While he had a pretty good start, he was not running 
        fast until the field moved past him at the end of the curve. Too little, too 
        late, put Traina at the finish line in 22.34, placing him 14th out of 17 entrants.
    
    
      
    
    The shot put led off competition on day two. Uzoma Orji, seeded 
        sixth, was out to improve on that seed. He warmed up with standing throws 
        around the 52' mark, a good sign. Orji's was the first thrower in the competition 
        and started with a 54-8 3/4 safety throw, one good enough to lead the first 
        round in the first flight. His second throw was a season best of 57-4 1/4, 
        the best of the first flight. In the second flight, the number two seed, Nate 
        Meckes from Calvin College, threw one within 10 cm. behind Orji. The number 
        one seed, and defending national champion, Cody Brotherton from McMurry University, 
        threw one 59-9 1/2. Orji was in second but not by much. In the finals, on 
        his fourth throw, the third seed, Brandon Houle of the University of Wisconsin 
        Oshkosh, popped one 58-2 1/2 to move into second. Orji did not produce a big 
        throw on his fourth effort, but blasted a 58-3 effort on his fifth to move 
        back into second by 1 cm. Meckes also improved to 57-9 to tighten things up. 
        Brotherton put on 60-4 1/4 to take a big lead. No one improved in the final 
        round although Orji certainly gave it his inspired best. Orji's second place 
        gave MIT a total of 13 points after two days of competition.
    
    
      
    
    The men's hammer throw began the competition on the final day 
        of the championship and Orji appeared ready to go. His warmups looked solid, 
        so even though he was seeded seventh at 188-8, he was confident he would place 
        well. Throwing last in the first flight, Orji threw a solid 184-8 to stand 
        in second in his flight. He was pulling the hammer slightly and did not tighten 
        his final turn, so there was something to look forward to. In the second round, 
        Jacob Gabrilska from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosk improved his lead, 
        but Orji came back with a 186-3 to take the lead. In the third round, Orji 
        improved to 187-8 while two throwers whose best was over 190 did not throw 
        well enough to make the finals and another 190+ thrower only threw 184-1.
    
    
      
    
    Only the number one seed, Kevin Becker of the University of 
        Wisconsin Lacrosse, passed Orji in the second flight, throwing 202-8. Another 
        190' thrower did not make the finals and the number two seed, Brandon Houle 
        of the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, only threw 180-9. In the finals, Orji 
        came out firing and launched a 189-2 personal best to expand his hold on second 
        place. Only one place changed hands in the finals as no one gave serious threat 
        to catching Orji. Trying to go for a big throw on his final effort, he straightened 
        up too early, did not counter and the hammer hit the circle, cutting his distance 
        severely. Moving from seventh seed to finish in second with five throws over 
        184' was by far his best day ever in the hammer.
    
    
      
    
    The final event for MIT was the 5000 meter race. Ben Schmeckpeper, 
        seeded 17th, was hoping to add to his cross country All America honors by 
        placing in the top eight in the elite field. The pace was pedestrian as the 
        first 400 was 75 seconds. Mike Vidumsky, the 19th and final seed, took the 
        lead, opening up an 80 meter lead by the mile mark as the pack continued the 
        slow pace of 4:57. The pace then picked up with a series of sub 70 second 
        laps. Schmeckpeper, who was running flat and back on his heels during the 
        slow first mile, was not able to accelerate with the pack during the second 
        mile and began to fall back. Even though his second mile was a 4:41, a normal 
        pace for this event, he fell back to near the back of the pack. As the pack 
        swallowed up Vidumsky, Schmeckpeper slowed to a 4:58 third mile. The race 
        became a two man sprint in the final 400 between 10K champion, Josh Moen of 
        Wartburg College and 10K runner-up, Macharia Yuot, from Widener College. Moen 
        held Yuot off to win his third NCAA Championship of the year (cross country, 
        outdoor 10K and 5K). Schmeckpeper finished in 15th in 15:09.84.
    
    
      
    
    MIT placed 12th with 21 points, their highest point total in 
        over a decade.

    **TECH OUTPERFORMS SEEDS TO EARN SECOND PLACE IN NEW 
        ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    May 7, 2005
    
    
      
    
    Uzoma Orji led the MIT Engineers to second place in the New 
        England Division III Championship this weekend by winning the hammer throw 
        and shot put and finishing sixth in the discus. MIT scored 99.5 points to 
        167.5 for Williams and 72.5 for Bates College among the 26 scoring teams.
    
    
      
    
    Tech had two other winners on this rainy and windy day. Eric 
        Khatchadourian kicked things off with an outstanding victory in the 10K with 
        a time of 32:44.10. With three miles to go Khatchadourian pulled away by going 
        from a casual 5:21 pace per mile for a 16:25 first three miles, to 5:08 pace 
        to pull away and win by nine seconds. The other victory was just as impressive. 
        Brian Anderson, continuing his comeback, ran just the 800. The challenge to 
        Anderson was that he was seeded 16th and forced to run from the slower section, 
        which ran before the fast section. Despite the strong winds and rain, Anderson 
        went out in 53.2 for the first 400. This was a little faster than the race 
        plan but he did not want anyone drafting off of him. Anderson held on to run 
        1:54.29. Then it was a waiting game to see what the fast section would do. 
        Foolishly, the leaders came through the first quarter in 58, virtually guaranteeing 
        the victory for Anderson. The best they could do was finish in 1:57, giving 
        Anderson the win.
    
    
      
    
    At the same time Khatchadourian was winning the 10K, Orji and 
        David Saylor were busy scoring points in the hammer. Saylor opened with a 
        personal best throw of 177-2 to take the lead. On his third throw, Orji passed 
        Saylor with a personal best of his own at 182-6. No one was able to pass them 
        with the wet circle, giving MIT 18 more points.
    
    
      
    
    It was at this point that things slowed down for MIT. In the 
        pole vault, favored, Nate Ball injured his healthy hamstring during the warmup. 
        Neither Omari Stephens nor Nestor Hernandez were able to match their bests 
        for the season, in part due to the erratic, but strong cross-winds, but they 
        did manage a tie for sixth and a third respectively. Favored to score 16 points 
        in the event, MIT was fortunate to come out with eight and a half.
    
    
      
    
    In the long jump and triple jump, Hernandez and Makinde Adeagbo, 
        not seeded to score, were not able to improve on their seeds and score some 
        much needed points and MIT had no entries in the high jump or javelin. This 
        meant only the discus and shot put remained among the field events with MIT 
        having only scored 26.5 points.
    
    
      
    
    MIT's woes continued as Orji, seeded fourth in the discus, could 
        not produce a big throw. Orji settled for sixth place with a throw of 142-11. 
        On the track, the 400 relay, seeded third, had to be thankful for a fourth 
        place in 42.86. David Blau had a great start and was in the lead at the first 
        exchange to Kenny Rosche. At the second handoff, Jonathan Hsieh came to a 
        near stop as they approached the end of the zone. At the final exchange Traina 
        was at championship speed and totally left Hsieh, having to slow down and 
        turn around to get the baton to guarantee a legal handoff. Traina blistered 
        the final leg to get the team fourth. Continuing with the unfortunate downward 
        spiral, Ben Schmeckpeper was not able to show the strong form he had last 
        week, and gave up time at every barrier as he stuttered and dropped his hips 
        while hurdling. Schmeckpeper was able to hang onto fifth in 9:22.92, but he 
        was seeded second and planning on winning the race.
    
    
      
    
    It was at this point where things turned back in MIT's favor. 
        In the 1500, John Brewer, seeded 20th, ran a personal best to win the slow 
        section in 4:00.53, despite the wind and rain, to place seventh overall. Traina 
        and Blau, qualifying for the finals of the 100 earlier in the day, finished 
        2-4 in 10.92 (10.87 in the trials) and 11.04 (personal best) respectively.
    
    
      
    
    After Anderson stepped up to win the 800, Orji stepped into 
        the shot put ring and easily won his specialty in 53-3 3/4. Chris Desrochers, 
        seeded 16th in the 400IH, won the first of three sections in a personal best 
        of 57.51 to secure eighth place as others were totally thrown off by the wind.
    
    
      
    
    This set up the return of Traina and Blau, this time in the 
        200. Drawing lanes three and one respectively, both were at a severe disadvantage 
        to those in the outside lanes, particularly with the wind hitting them in 
        the face at the start. Nevertheless, both ran personal bests, with Traina 
        placing second in a nationally qualifying, and MIT record of 21.53 and Blau 
        running 22.47 for sixth.
    
    
      
    
    MIT's final event was the 1600 relay. MIT was hoping to run 
        a season best but the wind picked up and the rain started coming down hard 
        to end those dreams. Traina led things off with a 51.4 leg, slowed in part 
        due to the fact he was in lane seven for the start of the three turn stagger 
        and did not have much of an idea of how to pace. Rosche took the handoff and 
        ran 50.6 to give MIT the lead. Jesse Collins ran the third leg in 52.1, putting 
        MIT in third as the baton came to Anderson. He was not able to hold off the 
        closing teams, finishing with a 52.1 anchor, which dropped MIT to fifth in 
        3:26.40
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT will split their squad between two meets. The 
        IC4A meet hosted by Princeton, which is also the Division I Regional Qualifying 
        meet, has moved their date forward a week and now conflicts with the All New 
        Englands.

    **TRAINA AND ORJI LEAD WAY TO FIFTH STRAIGHT NEWMAC 
        CHAMPIONSHIP WITH DOUBLE VICTORIES**
    
    
      
    
    April 30, 2005
    
    
      
    
    Despite a strong effort by Springfield College, MIT came out 
        strong with 90 points in the first five events, kept the effort strong with 
        double victories by Uzoma Orji and Zach Traina and closed out the victory 
        with 60 points in the final four events to win their fifth consecutive NEWMAC 
        Championship and sixth out of the seven championships since the conference 
        began in 1999. Following MIT's 246 points were Springfield College with 199, 
        Coast Guard with 167 1/2, host WPI with 78, Wheaton College with 54 and Babson 
        bringing up the rear with 15 1/2 points.
    
    
      
    
    The meet opened with the 10K and MIT set the tone for the afternoon 
        by claiming 2-4-5-6, by Ian Driver, Joe Roy-Mayhew, Spencer Dudley and Brian 
        Jacokes respectively. All but Dudley ran personal bests, but Driver perhaps 
        had the performance of the meet. Running a solid race by negatively splitting 
        with miles of 5:26, 5:21, 5:21, 5:21, 5:16 and 5:19 before finishing with 
        a 68 final quarter, Driver nearly caught the winner, who had lapped the field 
        and then faded to within eight seconds of losing the race. Driver's final 
        time of 33:12.38 was a personal best by over a minute. Roy-Mayhew, a freshman 
        who was injured since the summer, missing both cross country and indoor track 
        and just started racing four weeks ago, has continued to amaze his teammates 
        by consistently racing well beyond all expectations, this time running 33:44.07 
        to qualify for the New England Division III Championship.
    
    
      
    
    During the rain soaked pole vault, Patrick Barragan and Omari 
        Stephens went out early but not before clearing 12-5 1/2 to place sixth and 
        seventh. Nester Hernandez cleared 13-5 1/4 with no misses in the competition 
        to claim second. Nate Ball entered the competition after everyone else was 
        finished, cleared 14-6 and then 15-7 to set the meet record before retiring 
        for the day with the victory.
    
    
      
    
    In the hammer throw, number one seed Uzoma Orji lost for the 
        first time this season, but did so to teammate David Saylor. Saylor threw 
        a personal best, national qualifying mark of 175-0. The 1-2 finish provided 
        MIT with 18 more points. Throwing a personal best in the rain showed how good 
        Saylor really threw.
    
    
      
    
    Back on the track, Ben Schmeckpeper took the steeple lead at 
        the gun and won by 34 seconds as he ran a personal best and meet record of 
        9:20.0 while also qualifying provisionally for the NCAA Championships. Supporting 
        another 1-2 finish, Chris Bruce ran a personal best of 9:54.1. Kevin DiGenova 
        rounded out the scoring with an excellent finish to take over eighth place 
        in a season best of 10:32.1.
    
    
      
    
    The 400 relay was next on the track and the number one seeded 
        Engineers did not disappoint their teammates. David Blau got a good start 
        and had Tech in the lead at the first exchange to Kenny Rosche. Despite a 
        foot injury, Kenny ran one of his best legs of the season. Jonathan Hsieh 
        stumbled as he took off to get into position to receive the handoff from Roshce, 
        causing him to be no where near full speed when he received the baton. Nevertheless, 
        Hsieh ran his strongest leg of the season, giving him a significant lead as 
        he approached anchor leg Traina, who did not hesitate to put the race away, 
        finishing in a season best of 42.70. These first five events put MIT in a 
        commanding lead with 90 points and they never looked back.
    
    
      
    
    The drought of points in the high jump and javelin did not keep 
        MIT down. In the 1500, Brian Anderson, Fivos Constantinou and John Brewer 
        placed 2-3-4 with Anderson running a season best of 3:57.73 as he continues 
        his comeback. Carlos Renjifo gave support with an eighth place performance. 
        In the field, Nestor Hernandez came through with his second second place in 
        as many events when he jumped 21-1 1/2 in the long jump. Tom Hoover placed 
        fifth and Makinde Adeagbo held onto eighth to build MIT's lead.
    
    
      
    
    In the 110HH, Stephens did not place first as he was seeded, 
        but he did get third and Anthony Teixeira, who was not expected to place at 
        all, came in fourth with a personal best of 16.50. In the discus, Orji found 
        his winning touch despite the rain with a throw of 140-03.
    
    
      
    
    When MIT dropped below expectations in one event, they would 
        step up big in another event to more than make up for the points lost. A good 
        example was the 400 and 100 dashes. In the 400, Kenny Rosche, seeded 5th, 
        placed 6th with a very respectable 50.62. In the 100, Traina and Blau put 
        their considerable talents together and placed 1-2 in a season best for Traina 
        of 11.01 and a personal best for Blau in 11.10. Hsieh added two points with 
        his 7th place finish.
    
    
      
    
    The triple jump did not go as expected as Adeagbo was not able 
        to come though and settled for fourth place. Teixeira, having a great meet, 
        jumped his season best to place 6th. On the track, Chris Desrochers ran a 
        huge personal best by nearly a second, running 57.99 in the 400 IH to place 
        5th.
    
    
      
    
    Anderson returned to the track in the 800 and looked great as 
        he took the lead and kept it through 700 meters. However, he was passed by 
        two runners in the final straight to finish third in 1:56.43. Constantinou 
        ran 1:59.88 to finish 8th. 
    
    
      
    
    The 200 put the meet away as Traina, Blau and Rosche finished 
        1-3-5 for a nice 20 point score. Not to be outdone, the distance runners scored 
        22 points in the 5000 by placing 2-3-4-6. All MIT runners broke 16:00 with 
        Kevin Brulois in 15:35.24, Eric Khatchadourian in 15:39.28, Chris Wong in 
        15:42.02 and Erik Stafl with a 15:46.60.
    
    
      
    
    With the rain really coming down, Orji took to the shot put 
        circle. Aided by teammates Brian Malley and John Brewer keeping the circle 
        dry with towels each time before he threw, Orji threw a season best of 55-11 
        to win easily.
    
    
      
    
    The final event on the track, the 1600 relay was led off by 
        Traina with a 50.1 leg, his best ever. Brian Anderson was only able to put 
        together a 51.9 leg, as was third leg, Jesse Collins. Rosche anchored with 
        a 50.3 but it was not enough to claim first. The team had to settle for second 
        with a time of 3:24.22. For his efforts and superb performances, Zach Traina 
        was named Outstanding Male Athlete in the NEWMAC Conference for the season.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT heads west to Springfield College for the New 
        England Division III Championships. MIT is seeded to place second behind Williams 
        College but Bates and Tufts are seeded just a couple of points behind.

    **ORJI AND ANDERSON LEAD THE WAY AGAINST MAINE SCHOOLS 
        AND 21-1 FINAL RECORD**
    
    
      
    
    April 16, 2005
    
    
      
    
    Brian Anderson is back for his final season of eligibility after 
        nearly a year away from running caused by an injury to his hamstring and glute, 
        and Uzoma Orji picked up right where he left off - winning. On a perfect spring 
        day that saw temperatures near 70, sunny skies and a slight wind that picked 
        up as the meet progressed, MIT took advantage, scoring 283 1/2 points to 203 
        for Bates, 131 for Colby and 59 1/2 for Southern Maine.
    
    
      
    
    Bates College proved to be the perfect hosts as they allowed 
        a tardy MIT team to join the hammer throw, an event already in progress and 
        delayed the pole vault, long jump and high jump by half an hour to allow the 
        Engineers an opportunity to properly warmup. In addition, their best athlete 
        was in a non-scoring decathlon and others were not in their best events as 
        they tried to maneuver people around to prepare for their upcoming championships.
    
    
      
    
    Not wanting to waste the opportunity given them, Orji and David 
        Saylor responded with a winning throw of 179-11 and a personal best of 168-6 
        for third place respectively. Orji nearly threw a personal best in winning 
        the discus with a throw of 153-0 and just fouled on a 56 foot throw in the 
        shot put, which he easily won with a 54-2 1/2 effort.
    
    
      
    
    Leading the way on the track with two of the team's 11 total 
        victories, Anderson finished hard over the final 300 meters into the wind 
        to run 3:58.08, a sign he is nearly back to his All America form from the 
        past. Anderson put an exclamation point on this a little over 30 minutes later 
        with a come from behind 1:56.74 800 victory. Lending support in both of these 
        events, Fivos Constantinou ran 4:00.94 in the 1500 for third place and added 
        a fourth in the 800 with a 2:00.69 time. Also of note, in the 1500, John Brewer 
        showed he was almost back from his stress fracture as he qualified for the 
        New England Division III Championship with a 4:04.50 fourth place performance. 
        Carlos Renjifo added a fifth place in 4:05.50.
    
    
      
    
    Omari Stephens continued his winning trend in the high hurdles, 
        this time running 16.56 into the wind. Stephens also claimed a personal best 
        with a 13-0 pole vault to qualify him for the NE Div. III Championship in 
        three weeks.
    
    
      
    
    Zach Traina had a terrible start in the 100 but made up for 
        it with a victory in the 200 over Xavier Garcia, one of the top 400 runners 
        in the country. The time of 22.57 was an indication how much the headwind 
        had picked up by the end of the meet. David Blau lended support in both sprints 
        with a season best of 11.18 in the 100 for second place and a 22.95 in the 
        200 for fourth place.
    
    
      
    
    Other victories in the field events were supplied by; Makinde 
        Adeagbo, who jumped to an outdoor best in the triple jump of 43-2 1/4 for 
        the victory, Nate Ball, who returned from a slight hamstring pull with a 15-0 
        pole vault victory and Nestor Hernandez, who leapt to a 21-4 3/4 victory in 
        the long jump.
    
    
      
    
    On the track, Ben Schmeckpeper added a steeplechase victory 
        in 9:36.14. Support was given by Chris Bruce in his steeplechase debut, returning 
        after a long sabbatical from a calf injury to run 10:11.81 for third place 
        to narrowly qualify for the NE Div III Championship. Also running well, Kevin 
        DiGenova nearly ran a personal best with his 10:38.69, which was good for 
        sixth place.
    
    
      
    
    Two other events of note, the 5000 and 1600 relay produced outstanding 
        performances for this time in the season. Kevin Brulois and Chris Wong ran 
        season bests of 15:38.45 and 15:38.78 respectively to place third and fourth 
        in the quality field. Traina, Anderson, Jesse Collins and Kenny Rosche combined 
        to run 3:23.96 in the relay, a time no where near what they should do later, 
        but a great time given the short rest in the meet and how early it is in the 
        season.
    
    
      
    
    Placing second among 18 teams at UCSD, winning the Engineer's 
        Cup and this meet gives MIT an outstanding record of 21-1 for the season. 
        The team is anxiously waiting for the championships as they begin to peak 
        in their respective events.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, the Engineers are at home in a non-scoring invitational 
        where they hope to sharpen their performances and rest up for the NEWMAC Conference 
        Championship the week after.

    **BALL SETS MIT POLE VAULT RECORD AT UCSD COLLEGIATE 
        INVITATIONAL**
    
    
      
    
    March 26, 2005
    
    
      
    
    Not missing a step from the indoor season, Nate Ball won the 
        pole vault at the UCSD Collegiate Invitational with a school record and national 
        qualifying vault of 16-8 3/4. Ball's finale helped lead MIT to a second place 
        finish among the 18 teams participating in the meet with 90.5 points. Ball 
        entered the event at 15', giving everyone on the Tech team a scare when it 
        took him two attempts to clear the height. Ball cleared 15-6 on his first 
        attempt and then needed three attempts to clear 16-0, having to move up in 
        poles on his last attempt. This third attempt seemed to psych out the USC 
        vaulter who thought he had the event won. Ball, sensing the opportunity to 
        put the event away, easily cleared 16-6 on his first attempt to which the 
        Southern Cal vaulter had no response. On his third attempt, Ball cleared 16-8 
        3/4 with a solid clearance. Moving the bar to 17-00 3/4 Ball had three good 
        attempts but each time knocked the bar off on his way down.
    
    
      
    
    Uzoma Orji supported the Tech effort by scoring 24 points to 
        lead all MIT scorers. Orji won the hammer on day one with a very average throw 
        of 172-7, fouling on three of his four throws. On day two, Orji won the shot 
        put as expected with a solid series of 54 foot throws, the best being 54-5 
        1/2. Unable to get in good throwing position, Orji only managed a fifth place 
        in the discus with a toss of 145-10. Assisting Orji in the hammer, David Saylor 
        added a third place when he threw 159-2.
    
    
      
    
    Garnering the only other victory for MIT, Zach Traina pulled 
        away in the final 50 meters to win the 200 dash in 22.03, a fine time for 
        the first meet of the season. Earlier in the day, Traina had placed seventh 
        in the 100 with a 11.11 time and anchored a fourth place 4x100 team to an 
        excellent 42.87 performance. The 4x100 team was composed of David Blau, Kenny 
        Rosche and Jonathan Hsieh. In addition to his impressive leadoff in the 4x100, 
        Blau placed eighth in the 100 with a time of 11.19
    
    
      
    
    In the middle distance and distance events MIT scored 23 points. 
        Ben Schmeckpeper led the way with an impressive double, running his first 
        ever 10K on the first day and earning a second place in 31:51.11. On the second 
        day, Schmeckpeper came back with a fifth place in the 5k, running 15:22.25. 
        Eric Khatchadourian ran well in his first meet of the season by placing sixth 
        in the 10K with a 33:15.07. Although he did not place, Khatchadourian's time 
        of 15:55.67 was an impressive performance after having run the 10K the day 
        before. Also in the 10K, Chris Wong missed placing by one position but qualified 
        for the New England Division III Championship with a 33:45.84 performance. 
        Fivos Constantinou and Brian Anderson got the job done in the 1500, placing 
        third and seventh respectively. Anderson, racing for the first time in a year, 
        was unable to hold his early pace of 2:05 at the 800 and faded to 4:03.65. 
        Constantinou, running a more even pace, ran a 4:00.92 for a great start to 
        his season.
    
    
      
    
    In the jumps, Nestor Hernandez and Makinde Adeagbo added much 
        needed points to the Engineer's effort. Hernandez jumped 21-3 1/2 on his first 
        attempt in the long jump to place fourth overall. On his final attempt he 
        launched a jump well over 22 feet but fouled by about an inch. Also doing 
        well in the pole vault, Hernandez added a tie for eighth when he cleared 13-5 
        3/4. Adeagbo also achieved his best effort on his first attempt when he jumped 
        42-6 3/4 in the triple jump, an effort good for fifth place.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT will have some of their squad compete at the 
        Tufts University Snowflake Classic. On April 9, the team opens at home with 
        their first complete squad meet when they go against traditional rivals RPI 
        and WPI.
