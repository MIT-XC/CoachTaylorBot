  <p><strong><font size="+3">ENGINEEERS PLACE 5TH WITH FIVE ATHLETS AT ECAC DIVISION 
    III CHAMPIONSHIP</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 20, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">MIT made the trip to the ECAC Division III Championship being 
    hosted by Springfield College with only five of the athletes who had qualified. 
    The ECAC Division III Championship for most teams is simply a last chance 
    qualifier. Due to the fact that it is during exam week, and it being an easier 
    meet than the IC4A or All New Englands being held the previous weekend, it 
    makes little sense to bring back athletes who are not trying to meet the NCAA 
    championship qualifying standard. Even though MIT has six athletes who are 
    at least provisionally qualified for nationals, only four of them made the 
    trip to Springfield, while Nate Ball and Ben Schmeckpeper stayed home. The 
    four NCAA qualifiers who competed, Brian Anderson, Uzoma Orji, David Saylor 
    and Zach Traina, joined David Blau in an attempt to improve their best performances 
    this season. All five athletes placed in each event they participated in, 
    scoring a total of 33 1/2 points for fifth place.</p>
  <p align="left">The first event of the day was the hammer throw. Orji and Saylor 
    were seeded second and fourth. Saylor needed to improve his mark of 176-8 
    in order to make the field for the NCAA Championship. On his last throw of 
    the trials, Saylor threw a personal best of 177-7, which placed him fourth 
    overall. Orji waited until the first throw of the finals to get his personal 
    best, a toss of 188-8, good enough for the victory. Saylor passed one person 
    on the national list and tied another, although another competitor in the 
    field passed him.</p>
  <p align="left">In the 100, Blau, seeded 11th, qualified for the finals with 
    a 11.08 time in the trials. In the finals he did not have his best race but 
    still ran 11.16, good for eighth place. Later, Blau returned to the track 
    in the 200 along with teammate Traina. Blau, seeded 13th, was in the next 
    to last section and placed third in that section and tied for eighth overall 
    with a remarkable time of 22.32 into the wind. While the performance does 
    not match his PR of 22.16 run last week, that time was done with a significant 
    tailwind. The 22.32 is his second best time ever and his most impressive. 
    Traina did not get out very well and only managed to place sixth overall with 
    a 22.19.</p>
  <p align="left">Anderson, hoping to improve on his 1:52.84 run at the IC4A Championship, 
    was planning on going out in 55 for the first quarter and continue to push 
    the pace. The plan could not have gone any better for the first 600 meters. 
    Anderson went out in 55 even at the 400 having just taken the lead. The third 
    200 was perhaps a little fast, running 27 flat to come through 600 in 1:22. 
    Anderson did not have it on this particular day and faded down the homestretch. 
    He did finish in 1:54.77, and now he has to hope that his 1:52 will get him 
    into the national championship.</p>
  <p align="left">Orji was the last to compete, coming back in the shot put. With 
    no serious threats, Orji had to depend on his own motivation to see if he 
    could improve on last week's 57-3 put. Orji started with a 54 foot put and 
    came back with a 55-3 1/2 on his second throw. His form was great up to the 
    power position but flat in the delivery. He is currently ranked sixth in the 
    shot put and seventh in the hammer throw.</p>
  <p align="left">The Engineers will find out Monday night who gets in to the 
    NCAA Championship and who does not. Those who are in will fly to Wartburg 
    College in Waverly, Iowa on Tuesday to compete Thursday through Saturday.</p>
