    SIMMONS AND JONES DOUBLE UP ON VICTORIES AT ECAC DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
                  
    
    May 19-20, 2011
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers of MIT made the six hour bus ride to Moravian College for the ECAC Division III Championship, competing against the best Division III athletes in the East, the week prior to the NCAA Division III Championship. With MIT in finals this week, some student-athletes had to take exams early or have them proctored on the trip. Although quite a few Tech athletes qualified for this meet only those who have qualified for the NCAA Division III Championship or those with a great chance of doing so were brought to compete.
    
    
                  
    
    The first event of the meet was the women's Pole Vault. MIT faired very well in the event with Hazel Briner '11, placing sixth by clearing 11-2, Lauren Kuntz '13, tying for fourth at 12-2 and Karin Fisher '11, earning second place by clearing 12-11 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 100HH trials, Portia Jones '12, moved to the finals with a 14.63 to win her heat. In the 100 Meter Dash trials Jones also advanced to the finals, running 12.49 to win her heat into the strong headwind.
    
    
                  
    
    For the men of MIT, the only events taking place on day one were the 3000 Steeplechase and the 10K. In the Steeplechase, Stephen Serene '12, went out pretty well, but gave up half-way into the race, not capitalizing on an excellent opportunity to improve his NCAA Division III qualifying time. His final time of 9:46.02 was not competitive with his PR.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 10K, Dan Harper '12, was unable to get out with the leaders and quickly settled into the second group. The pace of the lead group was exactly what Harper wanted but he never bridged the gap to move up to that group. The first three miles were solid with a 15:05 split. However, the pace faltered a bit and Harper had a difficult time staying on pace. The second three miles slowed 15:19. Harper finished with a 71 second final lap so he had something left, but waited too long to use it. His final time was 31:35.29, good for fourth place.
    
    
                  
    
    The men's Pole Vault and Hammer Throw, both scheduled for day 1, were pushed back to day 2 due to the lightning delays.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two started with a slow, but constant rain for the early part of the meet. The first event was the Hammer while the Pole Vault was delayed for three more hours until the rain looked as though it might abate. Ken Cooper '13, threw 186-0 to place second despite the wet circle. CK Umachi '12, placed fifth at 176-02. That was the end of the throwing day for MIT. Even though Cooper, Umachi and Mitch Kelley '11, competed in the Discus Throw and Shot Put, all threw poorly, not coming close to their best in either event.
    
    
                  
    
    When the Pole Vault finally commenced, it was still raining. Nathan Peterson '12, had the pole slip out of his hands and decided not to take any more warmups. This was quite possibly an ill advised decision as he no-heighted, ending the season for the indoor All America vaulter. Cyrus Vafadari '12, performed well, earning third place by clearing 15-02. This was not a personal best, so he will have to sit on his 15-11 PR and hope that will get him into the NCAA field.
    
    
                  
    
    For the women, the first event was the 4x100 Relay. The foursome of Jackie Brew '14, Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12, and Jones, were hoping to improve on last week's 47.70 time and guarantee a trip to Nationals in that event. Whether it was the poor warmup, which did not allow enough time to test all the handoffs, or the weather, the Tech team ran poorly, badly exchanging the baton on the second and third handoffs and not  running particularly fast when they did have the baton. Their final time of 48.95 saw the top seeded team place fifth.
    
    
                  
    
    Things continued to go not so well when Jones ran the 100HH final. Getting too far behind in the first third of the race, as she was being too cautious instead of sprinting, there was too much to make up and not enough time to do it. Her 14.85 earned her a third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Fortunately, things took a big turn for the better in the next event, the 400 meters. Simmons went out fast and never slowed as she surpassed the NCAA auto standard in winning the event in a new MIT and ECAC Division III record of 55.68. Gross, running out of the slower section, won her section and placed fifth overall with a personal best of 57.74.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones kept the momentum going in the 100 Meter Dash when she won in 12.41. Her time was pretty good considering the wind and no tail wind whatsoever.
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons showed she can handle the 400 / 400IH double with less than an hour between when she came back on the track and won the long hurdle race in 60.86 despite being a little off pace for the first three hurdles.
    
    
                  
    
    Not to be outdone, Jones came back and won the 200 with a time of 24.95. Gross also raced the 200, placing fifth in 25.94.
    
    
                  
    
    The final race for Tech was the women's 5,000 Meters. Alina Gatowski '11, was ready to capitalize on her final opportunity to qualify for Nationals. Needing a sub 17:15, Gatowski moved to the front group by the end of the first 400. Her opening 1600 of 5:31 was right where she wanted to be. At the end of six laps, Gatowski made a premature move to take the lead. After one lap in the lead, she gave up for no apparent reason, slowing from 83 second pace to 87 seconds. Nevertheless, her 3200 was an excellent 11:06 and she looked fresh. However, she could not right the ship, continuing to spiral towards 90 second pace, running the third 1600 in 5:55. Her final time of 17:44.24 earned her fifth place in the race.
    
    
                  
    
    Since MIT was not in the meet to score points, and the higher priority was having everyone ready for the NCAA's next week, the Engineers decided not to race the 4x400, settling for second place as a team.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT will place their entries on Saturday and wait until Sunday to see who makes the final event fields for the NCAA Division III Championship. So far, the only ones making the automatic standard are Vlad Sobes '11 in the Javelin for the men, and for the women, Karin Fisher in the Pole Vault, Portia Jones and Amy Magnuson 'G in the 100HH, Jones in the 200, Simmons in both the 400 and 400IH, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, in the 10 and 5K and the 4x400 team of Simmons, Gross, Briner and Jones. Hoping to make the field from provisional status for the men are Cooper in the Hammer, Paul Welle '11 in the 3000 Steeplechase and Vafadari in the Pole Vault. For the women, Lauren Kuntz in the Pole Vault, Hazel Briner in the Heptathlon, Jones in the 100 and the 4x100 team of Jackie Brew, Gross, Simmons and Jones.
    
    
                  
    
    The NCAA Division III Championship is being hosted by Ohio Wesleyan University, Thursday, May 26 - Saturday, May 28.

    TECH TRACK BUILDS TWO VICTORIES IN ENGINEERS CUP
    
    
                  
    
    April 2, 2011
    
    
                  
    
    You never know what the weather will be like during early spring in New England. For the annual Engineer's Cup, this years weather was warm enough at 50 degrees, but the 30 mph winds were very difficult to compete in and the temperatures felt more like low to mid 40's. Nevertheless, not a single MIT athlete seemed too concerned about the weather, preferring to follow the MIT tradition of looking at adversity as a competitive advantage and focusing on their performances. The women ran away with a score of 217 points to 124.5 for RPI and 61.5 for WPI. The men's meet was much closer with MIT not pulling ahead for good until the 800 meters. Tech won with 180 points to 158.5 for RPI and 66.5 for WPI.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's meet was never in doubt as MIT won every running event with the exception of the 4x400, an event they could have won if they chose to. Portia Jones '12, won the 100 and 200 meter dashes, setting a new MIT record of 12.41 in the 100. Jackie Brew '14, lowered her freshman record to 12.58 while claiming second place in the 100. Other than that double win, MIT spread the wealth. 
    
    
                  
    
    In the 100HH, Amy Magnuson 'G, showed some of her old form as she won going away in 15.00. Magnuson led a one through six sweep of the event. Following behind her were Jones (15.38), Brew (15.50), Jackie Konopka '14, (16.05), Hazel Briner '11, (16.10), and Megan Bumgarner '14, (16.33). In the 7-5-4-3-2-1 scoring format, the 22 points put MIT out front to stay.
    
    
                  
    
    Jamie Simmons '12, took first place honors in the 400 in 58.19, a very fine time in the strong winds. Hazel Briner '11, jumped into uncharted territory to win the 400IH in 67.82. Alex Taylor '14, surprised many people by coming from behind to win the 800 in 2:24.98. In the 1500, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, dropped down to the shorter distances and led start to finish in 4:43.27, leading MIT to the top four places.
    
    
                  
    
    In the distance events, Maggie Lloyd '12, took the 3K Steeplechase crown with a well paced 11:43.56. Alina Gatowski '11, led the 5K from start to finish, running 18:18.27 in the difficult winds.
    
    
                  
    
    The 4x100 team of Brew, Martha Gross '12, Simmons and Jones won easily in 48.98. In the 4x400, MIT sat out its All America unit and still nearly pulled off the victory. Emily Kuo '13, led off with a 64.8 to put MIT slightly behind at the exchange. Chandler Burfield '13, ran a fine 63.4 to put MIT in the lead. Taylor lost the lead during the leg, but reclaimed it by the exchange. Stephanie Ku '14, fought off the RPI runner through most of the leg, but was edged out in the final 20 meters, 4:18.18 to 4:18.43.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, Karin Fisher '11, led a 1-2-3 sweep in the Pole Vault with her 12-2 victory. Claiming second and third were All America vaulters Briner and Lauren Kuntz '13. The only other field event victory for MIT came in the Long Jump where Brew jumped 16-3 to defeat Briner by two centimeters. While not claiming any victories, it was nice to see Christine Labaza '14, compete for the first time. Out with knee and ankle injuries in the winter, Labaza threw well, taking third place in the Discus with her 113-05.
    
    
                  
    
    The men's meet was much different. Although expecting to win, Tech had to rethink things when Kyle Hannon '13, was unable to race due to foot pain and Mitch Kelley '11, had to sit out due to illness. The loss of Babajide Akinronbi '14, and Jake Jurewicz '14, due to slight hamstring pulls the week before, Mattias Flander '11, being away for interviews, Dan Harper '12, out with illness and Logan Trimble '13, and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, not being ready to race, put MIT at a competitive level where they would have to take advantage of every opportunity to score points.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT won seven of the 11 running events, dominating the middle-distance, and distance events to provide the margin of victory. In the sprint events, MIT won the 100 with Josh Duncavage '13, running a personal best of 11.02. Nick Leonard '11, and Duncavage battled the entire lap of the 400IH to finish 1-2 respectively in excellent times of 56.36 and 56.42. MIT also easily won the 4x100 Relay with Duncavage, Leonard, Tyler Singer-Clark '14, and Nathan Peterson '12, substituting very well for Akinronbi.
    
    
                  
    
    The middle-distance events were where MIT did the damage. In the 800, Eric Safai '14, returned from a 9:58.69 fourth place in his 3000 Meter Steeplechase debut, to win out of the slow section in 2:00.93. The fast section just raced to win the section, allowing the first 400 to go out in a pedestrian 62. Nevertheless, MIT claimed the top four places in that section and 1-5 overall. In the 1500, MIT came from behind to take the top four places. Justin Bullock '14, led the way with a 4:06.03 victory.
    
    
                  
    
    The distance events provided more victories but not the same depth. Paul Welle '11, led start to finish in the 3000 Steeplechase to win in 9:41.58. Richard Prevost '11, took second in 9:44.76. The 5000 was also a 1-2 finish for MIT with Stephen Serene '12, and Ben Mattocks '12, taking the honors in 15:42.84 and 15:45.06.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x400 Relay, DJ Ronde '13, led things off, running a little behind RPI in 52.2. Logan Daum '11, ran well, keeping MIT close with his 52.1. Mac Gager '14, ran a strong 51.0 leg to give MIT the lead. Pat Marx '13, a little fatigued from the 800 and 200 Meter races did not take it out hard. When the RPI runner decided to make a move, Marx was able to fight him off until the final 20 meters, where similar to the women's race, RPI was able to inch out the victory 3:26.08 to 3:26.21.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, MIT only claimed two first places, but still did quite well, scoring 55 points. Jackson Wirekoh '13, took first place in the Triple Jump with a leap of 42-4 and Nathan Peterson continued his winning ways in the Pole Vault with a 15-1 effort. While not winning, Ken Cooper '13, earned three second places and three personal bests. In the Shot Put, Cooper threw 47-7, in the Discus 144-1 to miss first place by 4" and a provisional national qualifying throw of 178-2 in the Hammer. In the Javelin, Vlad Sobes '11, improved his national mark to 191-1, although he placed second.
    
    
                  
    
    Next Saturday, MIT travels to Lewiston, Maine to face host Bates College, Colby College and on the men's side, also Southern Maine.

    Four Athletes Travel to Princeton, Three Return With NCAA Qualifying Marks
    
    
                  
    
    April 22, 2011
    
    
                  
    
    Four MIT Track and Field athletes made the trip to Princeton University to race in the Larry Ellis Distance Night and three retured with NCAA Division III qualifying performances. The events raced were the 800-5000 meters. In order to enter the meet, an athlete had to make pretty challenging qualifying marks. MIT brought two male 3000 Meter Steeplechasers and two female 5K runners, all hoping to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championships.
    
    
                  
    
    With temperatures in the upper 40's and the threat of rain, it was close to ideal for the distance runners. Paul Welle '11, was up first for MIT, running in the second of three sections of the Steeplechase. Welle went out with the leaders, running 73 second quarters to come through the mile in 4:51. From the beginning, Welle's water jump was not the best, but as the race progressed he stopped driving his knee off of the barrier altogether, landing with both feet at the same time, virtually stopping after each jump. Nevertheless, Welle raced well and fought hard, finishing with a 35 second final 200 after two 87 second laps. His time of 9:12.93 met the NCAA Division III provisional qualifying time, missing the auto standard by less than six seconds.
    
    
                  
    
    Richard Prevost '11, was up next in the slower section of the event. Similar to his teammate, Prevost went out with the leaders. He came through the mile in 4:56 and took the lead briefly before fatiguing despite superb hurdle and water jump form. His final 600 meters in 1:57 hurt his time significantly, but the 9:23.10 still met the NCAA Division III provisional qualifying time.
    
    
                  
    
    Just before 9:00 p.m., Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, toed the line in the 5,000 Meter Race. Holt-Gosselin, the owner of a 36:02.79 10K NCAA qualifying time and a 17:19.86 MIT record, wanted to qualify with a solid sub-17:00 performance. The initial pace was a little fast, but Holt-Gosselin seemed to handle it well, splitting the first mile in 5:20. The pace of the second mile slowed as she fell off the group she had been with. Nevertheless, her 5:30 second mile and 5:31 third mile kept her in the race and even allowed her to move back up as many faded in the final mile. Her final 200 was 36 seconds, indicating there was still quite a bit more in the tank. The final time of 16:57.95, while just missing the NCAA Division III auto standard, is close to a sure thing for making the NCAA field. The 22 second demolition of the MIT record was an outstanding performance.
    
    
                  
    
    Alina Gatowski '11, in the second of three sections in the 5K, was also hoping to reach the NCAA provisional standard of 17:35. Her season best of 17:54 was certainly in danger. The 35 runners in the race, bunched up early in the race, running a pedestrian first mile of 5:39. Running much of that mile in the outside portion of lane two caused Gatowski to lose her focus and when the pace picked up she did not respond. While her second mile was a 5:34, she did not go with the leaders. Gatowski slowed to a 5:42 third mile and could only manage a 41 in the final 200. However, her 17:36.74 was a huge improvement and showed she just needs to build her confidence so she races for the win instead of just trying to hold on.
    
    
                  
    
    All four will be racing in their conference championship next Saturday, the NEWMAC Conference Championship will be hosted by the Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT.

    May 26-28, 2011
    
    
                  
    
    MIT entered the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field Championship with 12 athletes, nine women and three men. Competing for the women were Jackie Brew '14, in the 4x100 (13th) and 4x400 Relays (2nd), Hazel Briner '11, in the Heptathlon (13th), Pole Vault (19th) and 4x400 Relay (2nd), Karin Fisher '11, in the Pole Vault (3rd), Martha Gross '12, in the 4x100 (13th) and 4x400 Relays (2nd), Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, in the 10K (2nd) and 5k (4th), Portia Jones '12, in the 100 (9th), 100HH (16th), 200 (3rd), 4x100 (13th) and 4x400 Relay (2nd), Lauren Kuntz '13 in the Pole Vault (9th), Amy Magnuson 'G, in the 100HH (16th)and Jamie Simmons '12, in the 400 (2nd), 400IH (2nd), 4x100 (13th) and 4x400 Relays (2nd). Representing the men's team was Ken Cooper '13, in the Hammer Throw, Vlad Sobes '11, in the Javelin Throw and Paul Welle '11, in the 3000 Meter Steeplechase.
    
    
                  
    
    The night before the start of the meet, at the Coaches' and Athlete's banquet, Vlad Sobes was honored with the Elite 88 Award, which goes to the individual for each gender at the NCAA Championship with the highest GPA. In cases of a tie, the winner is the one with the highest number of academic units. Sobes has a perfect 4.0 GPA in Nuclear Engineering. An MIT athlete, Kyle Hannon '13, also won the award at the Indoor Championship. For the women, Lauren Kuntz was honored as one of the five with a perfect GPA, but she has less units than the winner. Portia Jones was awarded the New England Region Female Track Athlete of the Year.
    
    
                  
    
    For the women, accustomed to being on the podium the past three championships, placing third in last year's Outdoor Track and Field Championship and this year's Cross Country and Indoor Track & Field Championship, there was the extra incentive to win the Vercauteren Cup, an award given to the program with the best total of NCAA finishes for the three sports in the same academic year. MIT is leading the country going into the meet with six points with Williams College the next closest at 12 points. Last year, MIT lost the award by one point to the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh.
    
    
                  
    
    Day one began with the Heptathlon where Briner was hoping to improve on her seed to get into the top eight and score some points for the team. Beginning with a personal best in the 100HH, she then had a difficult High Jump, only clearing 4' 7". Even though she finished the first day with a solid Shot Put of 34', she was only able to manage a 27.10 in the 200, which put her back in 21st place overall in the event.
    
    
                  
    
    Ken Cooper was the victim of nature's whims, as after one throw in his flight, the meet was postponed due to lightning. When he returned to the competition his next two throws were fouls and his first throw was not enough to make finals.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, things improved significantly. In the 4x100 Relay trials, MIT was not favored to make the finals or score. However, Tech new if they extended the handoff zone another five meters, the time should drop significantly. The handoffs were very good for Brew, Gross, Simmons and Jones, but still too early in the zone to guarantee the baton would maintain the speed through each zone. The result was amazing nonetheless asMIT was the third fastest team with 46.93, a .73 improvement on their best and a new MIT record.
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons was up next in the trials of the 400IH. Despite decelerating at all but the last two hurdles she still ran the fastest time in the trials with a 60.62. If Simmons is able to find her rhythm she will be very difficult to beat in the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 200 trials, Jones got out well and had no competition in the final 100 as she walked away with a heat win in 24.61 to make the finals with the second fastest time of the day.
    
    
                  
    
    The 4x400 brought back the same foursome as the 4x100, but a different order. Simmons would leadoff with Gross running the second leg. Brew, not having run a 400 since junior high school, not even in practice, would handle the third leg and Jones would anchor. Even though MIT had run the second fastest time in the country with their 3:48.53, they new that all the teams were good and that a 3:48 may not qualify for the finals. With Brew being a wild card of sorts, the pressure was on Simmons and Gross to get the job done early. Simmons recovered enough from her 400IH trials to turn a 55.9 leadoff to give MIT the lead. Gross ran a personal best split of 56.2 to keep MIT in the lead by about 10 meters. Brew received an excellent handoff and took off fast. Thinking she was not that good and should not be too far ahead, she intentionally slowed after the 200, but still managed to keep MIT in the lead with a 57.7 leg. Jones hammered home a 55.9 to give MIT a 3:45.71 for the fastest time in the trials.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event on day one for MIT was the 10K. Holt-Gosselin has been nursing a lower leg injury for the past month. The reduced mileage and lack or hard efforts seemed to take their toll. The spirit was there as she stayed with the lead group of five through two miles, running mile splits of 5:35 and 5:34. However, at that time her legs started to give out and she was no longer able to stay with the lead group, falling off badly.
    
    
                  
    
    At the end of day one, MIT is in position to do very well in Saturday's finals. Day two brings a whole new set of challenges, including the women's Pole Vault that was moved due to the lightning delay.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two began with the aforementioned Pole Vault. The opening height was 11' 1 1/2, which both Briner and Kuntz cleared on first attempt. Kuntz cleared 11' 7, but Briner was not able to make the necessary adjustments and could not successfully clear the height. Kuntz then cleared 11' 11, which meant she was now All American in the event since only eight vaulters were remaining, including three who had not come in yet. At 12' 3, Fisher came in and cleared on her first attempt. Kuntz also cleared for a new PR, becoming one of the final five vaulters. At 12' 7 1/4 Kuntz again cleared for a new personal best. Fisher also cleared and now there were only four vaulters remaining. Kuntz did not clear 12' 11, but Fisher and the other two vaulters did. Fisher was in third on misses, but reversed things by clearing 13' 3 on her first attempt while the other two vaulters took two to three attempts to clear. Fisher was in first and for anyone to beat her they would have to set a new NCAA Division III record. They both cleared it, dropping Fisher to third when she was unable to make the height. Placing third and fourth with new personal bests and scoring 11 points for MIT far exceeded expectations and put MIT on the scoreboard early in the meet.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up for MIT was the first running event of the evening, the 100HH. Not seeded to score, Jones and Magnuson had All America experience and knew how to get the job done. Magnuson was runner-up in 2007, missed the 2008 season with a hamstring injury, placed fourth in 2009 and missed all of 2010 with another hamstring injury. Jones earned fifth place in 2010. Magnuson was in the first heat and brought back the old magic and then some, running a personal best of 14.26 to make the finals as the fifth fastest qualifier. Jones was in heat two. Despite still having fears of the event due to the fall that tore her ulnar ligament and resulting surgery earlier in the season, Jones blasted out of the blocks, going on to win the heat in a season best of 14.13, the fastest time in the trials.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 400, Simmons was the second seed, but the field was very fast and not separated by very much time. Running out of the second heat, Simmons ran a very strong 55.96, but finished third in her heat. Even though her time was faster than anyone in the third heat, she did not make the finals due to the advancement rules that took the top two of each heat and the next fastest two individuals. The top four in the first heat ran faster than Simmons, which bumped her out by :07.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones was back in the 100, where she was not seeded to score. The 100HH seemed to take a lot out of her concentration and focus because her start was abysmal in the 100. She drove straight up at the start, getting out of the race in the first 10 meters. She recovered enough to run 12.45, but not close to qualifying for the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event of day two for MIT was the Men's 3000 Meter Steeplechase. Paul Welle had not raced since May 7, due to a difficult double of the 5K and Steeplechase run that day. Not thinking he would get into the NCAA field, Welle had lost some of his training the past couple of weeks. However, his attitude and competitiveness were certainly with him in this race. Going with the large pack of leaders, Welle held on very well despite the first 1600 in 4:49. At that point he lost a little ground with a 75 second lap. He fell to 10th place in the large field, but then held on to finish in a very respectable 9:17.38.
    
    
                  
    
    On the final day, MIT has Sobes competing in the men's Javelin. The women have a chance to add to their 11 points with Jones in the final of the 100HH and the 200, Magnuson in the 100HH, Simmons in the 400IH, Holt-Gosselin in the 5K and the quartet of Brew, Gross, Jones and Simmons in both the 4x100 and 4x400 Relays. It will probably take over 40 points to be of of the top four teams on the podium and MIT has a chance to do just that.
    
    
                  
    
    Day three, the final day of competition, finally brought warm temperatures and sunshine, but also a very significant headwind on the homestretch reaching four meters per second. MIT began the day with the 4x100 Relay. Tech had a great start and excellent handoffs, but just were not fast enough to better their 46.93 in the trials. Running a 47.12 they place fifth, still much better than their 13th seed entering the meet.
    
    
                  
    
    Next were the 100HH, another event where MIT was not seeded to score, but with both Jones and Magnuson in the finals, points were coming MIT's way. Again, into the headwind, the times were not fast, but Jones had an excellent race to take second place in 14.57. Magnuson placed fourth in 14.64 to give MIT another 12 points, already totaling 17 for the day where MIT was not supposed to score.
    
    
                  
    
    Next for MIT was the Men's Javelin Throw. Vlad Sobes had been nursing a bad shoulder for the past month and had not thrown in three weeks. On his first throw he pulled down a little on the javelin at the release, had a poor throw and fouled intentionally. On his second throw he managed 192-8 for his best throw, but not enough to reach finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, Simmons was up in the 400IH. Having the fastest time in the trials, MIT was hoping for big points from Simmons. Her timing was not quite there and with the strong headwind on the homestretch was unable to make up the ground she usually does. Running an excellent 60.65, she was only.08 out of second place, but ended up fourth for five more points.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones was back up in the 200. Seeded third in the event, Jones came through with that place in 24.91, a slow time, but with the strong wind the entire field was slow. The six points gave MIT a total of 39 points and guaranteed a podium position of fourth place. However, with the 5K and 4x400 Relay remaining there was still a chance for MIT to pass Methodist for third place since they were finished competing and totaled 48 points.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 5000, Holt-Gosselin gamely returned to the track to try to finish her collegiate career with a strong race and score some points for the Engineers. Running a great race for the first half of the race, Holt-Gosselin's legs would not cooperate, leaving her exhausted and unable to compete well despite here fierce desire to stay in contention. She had a marvelous career, leaving her collegiate career with four varsity records, the indoor 3K, outdoor 5K and 10K as well as the anchor of the DMR.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event was the 4x400 Relay. In order for MIT to move up from fourth place they would have to win the event. Simmons did her part, throwing down a marvelous lead-off leg of 54.9, her fifth 400 in three days. Gross began her leg with a 10 meter lead thanks to an excellent handoff. She was unable to match her leg from the trials, perhaps due to an ankle sprain that she says did not bother her. Her 57.1 leg put her in third by a few feet. Brew, now starting her second 400 ever, went out with the two leaders, but died off in the final 200. Her 58.0 was excellent but put Jones 30 meters down from first and at least 20 from second. Jones went out strong, cutting the lead in half by the 250 mark, but was unable to finish it off. MIT finished in third with a time of 3:45.93.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's fourth place not only was the fourth NCAA Championship in succession where the team reached the podium (top four teams), but the 10 points in the Vercauteren Cup Standings gave MIT the title of the best Women's Program in the Country for the sports of Cross Country, Indoor Track and Outdoor Track.
    
    
                  
    
    The entire NCAA party for MIT is looking forward to the summer break and a rejuvenation for the 2011-12 year.

    Women Claim Title, Men Are a Close Second in New England Division III Championship
    
    
                  
    
    May 7, 2011
    
    
                  
    
    MIT hosted the New England Division III Men's and Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championship this weekend. The Engineers competed fiercely on their home track, overcoming a significant disadvantage to the higher seeded Williams College. The women came out on top in the 29 team field, edging Williams by 3.5 points, 141.5 to 138. The men came very close, closing out the meet with extraordinary determination, but fell four points short, finishing second among the 29 teams with 147 points to 151 for Williams.
    
    
                  
    
    Going into the meet, the men were 12 point underdogs to Williams while the women were over 30 point underdogs, depending on how one predicted the 10K outcome. In 2009, MIT's women swept the Cross Country, Indoor Track and Outdoor Track New England Division III titles while in 2010 they finished fourth in Cross Country (although they finished third at the NCAA's), and second in both Indoor and Outdoor Track. They started 2011 off with a very close second place finish in the Indoor Track Championship and were pretty sick of the bridesmaid position. The men won the New England Division III titles Indoors in 2010 and finished second Outdoors, losing the meet in the final event. The men closed out 2010 with the Cross Country title. They began 2011 in similar fashion, defending their Indoor Championship. Now they were hungry for an Outdoor title and there is no place like home to do so.
    
    
                  
    
    The three day men's meet began with the first day of the Decathlon. There were only eight qualifiers entered to compete. One of which was Nick Leonard '11, of MIT. Leonard had not trained for or competed in the Decathlon since his freshman year, since concentrating on the hurdle event. About four weeks ago, Leonard again began training for the Dec., qualifying for this championship one week later.
    
    
                  
    
    At the end of day one, Leonard was in third place, which was the same as his seed. On day two, Leonard moved into second briefly but the throwing events pushed him back to third. An inspired 1500, run in 4:50 was enough to keep him in third with 5507 points. Isaac Nicholson '11, of Williams leading through day one, fell over the last two hurdles in that event and no-heighted in the pole vault to eliminate any chance of winning the event. He still came back to finish in fifth, a remarkable sign of competitiveness.
    
    
                  
    
    In addition to the completion of the Decathlon, Friday's events were day one of the Heptathlon as well as the Men's and Women's Long Jump, Discus, 10K and the men's Javelin. Hazel Briner '11, finishing second in the Heptathlon last year and not making the NCAA field, and fouling out in the Long Jump in the Pentathlon at the 2011 Indoor New England Division III Championship to fail in defending her title, was hungry to regain her place at the top. Winning the 100 Hurdles with a personal best of 15.32, she never looked back, leading the pack at the end of day one. 
    
    
                  
    
    MIT did not have an entry in the Men's Long Jump and did not score in the Women's Long Jump. However, Williams College did not fail to take advantage. In the men's competition, they improved on their seeds, claiming first and second, while the women placed first and fourth, despite All America jumper, Tanasia Hoffler '13, unable to compete due to a hamstring injury.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Discus, MIT women did not score, although Christine Labaza '14, finished 10th, less than three feet out of eighth place, the last scoring position. Williams again proved up to the task, placing second and seventh for an early total of 25 points. MIT's men were favored to score nine points in the Discus, but unbelievably did not bring the necessary intensity needed to do well in a championship of this magnitude. Williams continued their success, moving up one spot on their seed position. The men from Williams now had 26 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The 10K for the women was quite possibly the best 10K in the country this year, certainly for Division III. The Williams contingent were out to not only score points, but to qualify for the NCAA Championship. MIT was just trying to score as many points as possible since Anna Holt-Gosselin '11 already had a solid NCAA qualifying time. The race began with a crisp 84 second first 400 and the only deviation to the 84-85 second 400 splits came in the final two laps. The trio of Jennifer Gossels '13, of Williams, Holt-Gosselin and Annie Dear '13 of Williams, dropped the pace to an 83 pace and then lit it up with Gossels pulling away to win in 35:18.82 with Holt-Gosselin in second at 35:20.79. These are the top two times in the country at this time. Dear finished third for Williams and the Ephs also claimed fourth for 21 points. Alina Gatowski '11, and Tania Morimoto '12, also scored for MIT, placing sixth and seventh respectively to keep MIT close in the scoring. The men's race was no less exciting, but was far from an MIT vs. Williams dual. The pace for the men was a much more reasonable 77 to 78 seconds per lap until the 8000 meter mark. Roy Wedge '14, and Dan Harper '12, were representing MIT and were with the leaders. The pace now picked up to 72 seconds, breaking up the lead pack, which became a dual between Wedge and Connecticut College's Shawn Mulcahy '11, the top seed. Wedge was relentless then threw down a 64 last 400 to put the win away in 31:47.89. Harper finished in third in 31:58.78, defeating the lone Williams scorer in fourth.
    
    
                  
    
    In the men's Javelin, Vlad Sobes '11, of MIT, seeded third, opened up with a new MIT record of 214-05, an automatic NCAA qualifying mark. The next closest mark was 188-08, giving Sobes an easy victory and a big 10 points for MIT. 
    
    
                  
    
    At the end of day two, Williams was sitting with 56 points to MIT's 23 in the women's meet, while in the men's meet, MIT had a small lead over Williams 32 to 31. While day two was warm but very windy, day three was predicted to be a high of 64 with thunder storms off and on throughout the day.
    
    
                  
    
    Day three began with amazing weather, contrary to the predictions and amazing performances. MIT athletes made it through the qualifying rounds of the 100 Meter Dash and High Hurdles with no surprises with the exception of Brian Djaja '13, in the 110HH, who dropped a half second off his time to run 15.70 and make the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Briner continued to dominate the Heptathlon, scoring 4431 points for a new MIT record and qualify provisionally for the NCAA Division III Championship.
    
    
                  
    
    The first final of the day was the 3000 Meter Steeplechase. MIT was seeded third and sixth while Williams was seeded in seventh and eighth. Williams moved up to third and seventh while Tech dropped to only a sixth. However, Martina de Geus '14, while not placing as high as she was seeded, raced marvelously, setting a new MIT freshman record and qualifying provisionally for the NCAA Division III Championships. The men dominated the event. Paul Welle '11 ran 9:17.07 to claim second place. Stephen Serene '12, ran a huge personal best to claim fourth in 9:22.77, an NCAA provisional qualifying mark. Richard Prevost '11, ran a gutsy 9:25.25 to get fifth. Williams also moved up in the event, placing first and eighth.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x100 relay, MIT's team of Jackie Brew '14, Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12, and Portia Jones '12, tied their own MIT record of 48.28 in winning the event. Williams did not score, allowing MIT to chip away at the seemingly huge point deficit. In the men's race, Josh Duncavage '13, Leonard, Tyler Singer-Clark and Nathan Peterson '12, did the unimaginable, winning in a season best of 42.80. This was with MIT's top sprinter being out with an injured hamstring.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events things started going MIT's way at least in the sense that Williams was not living up to their seeds. In the High Jump, Megan Bumgarner '14, placed in a tie for eighth while not being seeded to score while Williams did not score after being seeded fifth. For the men, Matt Falk '12, moved up from a non-scoring seed to place third with a new personal best of 6-04. Williams only managed to move up one place from their seeds, allowing MIT to close in a little more.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's throwers made up for their Discus performance by placing third and fourth in the Hammer Throw. Kenneth Cooper '13, improved to 187-07 while CK Umachi '12, moved up his PR to 179-11, both improved NCAA qualifying marks. Williams was seeded to score fourth and eighth but only managed a seventh. MIT was not expected to score in the women's Hammer, and did not, but the second seeded Williams thrower fouled out.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Pole Vault, Cyrus Vafadari '12, vaulted to a personal best of 15-11 to win the event and qualify provisionally for the NCAA Division III Championship. Nathan Peterson, was not able to clear another height after the successful 4x100 relay, leaving him in sixth place at 14-5 1/4. The Williams vaulter moved up from his eighth seed to finish third. The women did not dominate quite  as much as they were hoping, but they certainly helped MIT's cause by having a marvelous event. Karin Fisher '11, cleared 13-1 to win the event. Lauren Kuntz '13, cleared 12-1 1/2 for a new personal best and second place. Briner came back from the Hep. to claim fourth at 11-7 3/4. Becky Stavely '11, had a great day, taking eighth place at 11-1 3/4. The 24 points for MIT were the biggest single event total for MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Triple Jump, Williams was seeded to score 19 points on the women's side. Without Hoffler, they still managed 14 points. Fisher jumped a personal best of 35-08 for MIT, but finished one place out of scoring in ninth. Jackson Wirekoh '13, seeded 18th, jumped a two foot personal best of 45-09 3/4 to place an amazing fourth, easily the performance of the meet for MIT. Even with that Williams placed first and third to score 16 more points.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the oval it was time for the 1500. MIT was not seeded to score in the event although they had the defending Mile indoor champion, Kyle Hannon '13. All four of MIT's runners were in the unseeded section since  they had all run 4:00 this season, a fast time, but not fast enough for the seeded section. Justin Bullock '14, ran an excellent 3:57.19 and Hannon 3:58.75, but neither placed. On a positive note, Williams was favored to win, but only placed sixth and seventh. For the women, Williams continued to fail to take advantage of a lack of MIT runners. While no MIT runners were racing, Williams was seeded to win and  garner seventh and eighth as well, but only managed an eighth.
    
    
                  
    
    The High Hurdles was MIT's second best event on the women's side and they came through with a second place by Portia Jones in a season best 14.57. Amy Magnuson 'G, tied her season best 14.59. Brew made the finals and placed eighth in a personal best of 15.28. Williams had no one in the finals. For the men, Djaja continued to defy all odds and placed sixth with a new PR of 15.33. Williams however placed 1-3-5 to dominate the event.
    
    
                  
    
    The 400 was next and MIT's Simmons ran a personal best and national qualifying mark of 56.28, but only managed a close second. Gross ran a season best of 58.59 to place fifth. Again, Williams failed to score. However, on the men's side, MIT did not have an entry but Williams did and placed second and tied for sixth for 10.5 more points.
    
    
                  
    
    The 100 for the women saw Jones come back and earn second place in a personal best, new MIT record and national qualifying mark of 12.16. Brew placed eighth in 12.70 to give MIT nine more points. Williams did manage six points with a third place finish. In the men's race, the faulty blank in the starter's gun was loud enough for the runners to hear, but not loud enough to start the automatic timing system. The officials got the places but not the times. Duncavage placed fifth after running 10.98 in the trials.
    
    
                  
    
    It was hoped Pat Marx '13, would match his freshman year magic in the 800, but he never got it going. He ran 1:55.87, but only placed eighth. First place was only 1:54.86. Williams grabbed a key third place. In the women's race, MIT did not have an entry, but Williams did and they capitalized with a third place.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 400IH, Simmons came back and won this time, defending her title in 62.16. Williams had the fourth seed, but she failed to score. Leonard continued to have a great meet, this time running a season best despite a full Decathlon, the HH trials and the 4x100. His 55.34 was good for eighth place. Williams performed brilliantly, placing 1-3-6 to keep MIT at bay.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones did her job once again, this time winning the 200 in 24.58 with Gross supporting very well with a time of 25.42 to claim fourth while Williams managed a fifth and seventh. Duncavage and Singer-Clark teamed up again to take third and fourth, but with Singer-Clark taking third in a personal best 22.18. Duncavage ran 22.24.
    
    
                  
    
    The Shot Put was finishing around this time and brought more good news for MIT. Cooper placed fourth with a fine throw of 50-0 3/4. Mitch Kelley '11, threw a season best of 49-8 1/4 for fifth. Williams did not score. The women's Shot was a key event. Williams was seeded to take fifth and seventh in the Shot, but fell to sixth and seventh in the results. MIT failed to score. MIT was up by 21.5 points at this time and knew Williams was planning to bring back their strong distance squad in the 5K. Every point was going to count. 
    
    
                  
    
    With only the 5k, 4x400 and 4x800 to go, both meets were still on the line. Every member of MIT's team, despite the late hour due to two lightning delays of over three hours, were lining every foot of the turns and back stretch, ready to chant a loud "MIT" every time an MIT runner came by. In the men's meet, Williams held a 12 point advantage. Tech was bringing back their five best distance runners, but all had run either the 10K or 3K Steeplechase in the meet. Unfortunately the pace was just too fast to allow MIT to have it come down to the final 800 where MIT had the advantage. Welle placed fifth for MIT in a PR of 15:01.94. Although MIT ran excellent times, Harper (15:13.71), Serene (15:28.71), Wedge (15:28.71), Prevost (15:34.41) were unable to score. Williams did not get what they were seeded for, but did manage seven points to all but ice the victory. In the women's race, Holt-Gosselin sat out due to   foot pain, but Gatowski and Morimoto got on the track to see if they could assist Brooke Johnson '13, to try and hold MIT's lead. Williams group of runners took the pace out hard enough that MIT's runners could not go with them despite the cheers from their teammates. Johnson ran a huge personal best of 17:45.51 to place fifth for MIT's only score while Williams took 1-2-4-8 for a whopping 24 points.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT was still up by 2.5 going into the relays in the women's meet. The men were down by 15 so short of a DQ, there was not much of a chance for MIT to win. However, the athletes knew that stranger things have happened and did not relent. In the 4x800, Louise van den Heuvel '14, Chandler Burfield '13, Maggie Lloyd '12, and Alexandra Taylor '14, were nervous but competitive and showed it. van den Heuvel ran a PR of 2:19.4 to give MIT the lead. Burfield went up against a phenomenal Williams runner, going out in 65 to try and stay with her, but died in the final lap. She still held on to a 2:23.6 split and remained in second place. Lloyd put together her own PR of 2:19.2 to keep the team in second. Taylor took it out well, but the anchor legs were strong and two passed her in the second lap. In the homestretch she fought back to catch one, splitting a PR of 2:20.9 giving MIT third place in 9:23.54 even though Williams placed first. The men ran an excellent race. Jared Forman '14, ran an inspired leg, splitting 1:57.9 to put MIT even at the handoff. Bullock continued his very impressive freshman year, running 1:55.0 to give MIT the lead. Logan Daum '11, ran an excellent 1:58.2, but MIT was slightly behind at the handoff. Hannon ran a 1:54.5 to outsprint the Williams runner who placed third in the open 800. MIT's overall winning time was 7:45.70.
    
    
                  
    
    With only the 4x400 to go, the men were down by 11 and no way possible to win. The women were now behind by 1.5 points. The women knew they had to win the event to guarantee the victory, and having one of the best 4x400 teams in the country gave them pretty good odds of getting the job done. Simmons left no doubt as she led off with a 55.4 to give MIT a lead they would never relinquish. Briner came back with a 60.6 to allow Williams to get within 30 meters, but then Gross split 58.1 and Jones closed the lid with a 56.1 to run an NCAA qualifying time of 3:50.34. Williams fell to fourth place to give MIT a 3.5 point victory. There was no sign from the 4x400 team that the MIT men could not win. Duncavage took off and split a 50.4 to put MIT in the thick of the chase. Singer-Clark ran 49.5 to give MIT the lead. DJ Ronde '13, ran an excellent 50.4 to give Pat Marx a slight lead after an excellent handoff. Marx battled the entire 400 to finish in 48.9 and give MIT a sweep of the three relays. The winning time of 3:19.42 was easily a season best. 
    
    
                  
    
    The performances and energy displayed by MIT was nothing short of inspirational and shows what a true team attitude can bring to the performance table. For the next two weeks, MIT will forget about the team aspect, instead working on individuals trying to qualify or improve their qualifying marks for the NCAA Division III Championships in three weeks. Next weekend the Engineers will travel to Southern Connecticut State University for the NEICAAA Championship, an opportunity to compete against all the Division I, II and III teams in New England.

    MIT IMPROVES NATIONAL QUALIFIERS
    
    
                  
    
     AT NEICAAA CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
                  
    
    May 13-14, 2001
    
    
                  
    
    MIT accomplished what it wanted to do at the NEICAAA Championship, getting some more NCAA Division III provisional qualifiers and improving some provisional marks to automatic marks. This championship, hosted by Southern Connecticut State University, that combines the colleges from all three NCAA divisions throughout New England, lost some of its teams and top individuals this year due to a conflict with the IC4A/ECAC Championship. In addition, with many conferences holding their championships the weekend before, quite a few individuals, particularly distance runners were resting up if they had already qualified for nationals or planned on making another attempt the following weekend.
    
    
                  
    
    The women started things off on the final day with the 4x100 Relay. Barely having qualified provisionally the past two weeks with times of 48.28, the quartet of Jackie Brew '14, Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12 and Portia Jones '12, knew they would have to run under 48 seconds to have a good shot of making the national field. They did better than expected, stretching out the acceleration zone to make the handoffs more full speed, they had excellent exchanges, keeping the baton moving full speed through the zones to finish fourth in 47.70, a new MIT record.
    
    
                  
    
    Next for MIT was the 100HH, where Amy Magnuson 'G, had hit the auto standard of 14.57 the day before in the trials. With a great first step out of the blocks but standing up too early afterwards, Magnuson was a little behind the leaders on the first hurdle. Technically, she ran a solid race, but did not improve her time, running 14.58 to finish seventh. Brew did not make the finals, but did run a new personal best of 15.18 the day before.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Pole Vault, MIT did not quite have their usual dominant showing and no one earned a personal best, but certainly performed well enough to score some significant points. Karin Fisher '11, placed third, clearing 12-5 3/4. Lauren Kuntz '13, was fifth with a vault of 11-11 3/4 and Hazel Briner '11, tied for eighth at 11-5 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones was up again, this time in the 100 Meter Dash. She had a good start and an excellent acceleration and transition phase, clocking 12.02 to finish third and set a new personal best and MIT record. She also moved up significantly on the NCAA list, putting her in solid position to make the national field.
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons made the final of the 400IH by recording the fastest time in the trials on day one, a 61.04, the fastest time in the country for Division III. In the final, although she had a very poor final hurdle to slow her time by about a second, she sped to victory with a season best 60.73.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event for the women was the 4x400 Relay. There were some unanswered questions regarding the individuals on the team being ready for nationals and this was the race to answer those questions. Simmons, who seemed to be lighting the track up recently, got off to an uncharacteristic slow start until the inside lane made up the stagger. She then took off, closing very well to handoff in 56.4. Gross had not run a great leg all year, but this is the time of year when she usually comes around and she did not disappoint, running an excellent 56.9 to put MIT in a close second. Briner took over baton duties next, running a very respectable 59.8 while keeping MIT close to second place. Jones got out well despite a slow baton exchange. She moved into second place by the 200 mark, pulling away in a 55.2 split to give MIT second place in 3:48.53, their fastest time this year.
    
    
                  
    
    On the men's side, the Pole Vault was held on the first day. Nathan Peterson '12, looked a little more like he did indoors when he finished fifth at the NCAA Championship. He cleared a season best of 15-9 to win the event and had a decent attempt at 16-3. Cyrus Vafadari '12, also cleared 15-9 to finish third on misses.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Shot Put, Ken Cooper '13, had a huge PR, putting the shot 52-8 3/4 to place seventh in the talented field. Teammate Mitch Kelley '11, threw well but was out of the scoring with his mark of 48-10 1/4. Kelley came back in the Discus to earn three points with his sixth place throw of 156-5.
    
    
                  
    
    The women finished in 7th place with 41 1/3 points. The men earned 14th place with 21 points. Not bad for partial teams against Division I and II competition.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, the Engineers travel to Moravian College in Pennsylvania to compete on Thursday and Friday in the ECAC Division III Championship. MIT will be in exams next week and therefore only taking those who have qualified for the NCAA Championship.

    MIT SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDS NEWMAC CHAMPIONSHIP TITLES
    
    
                  
    
    April 30, 2011
    
    
                  
    
    MIT was heavily favored to win both the men's and women's titleS in their defense of the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Championship. So much so, that both teams decided to back off a bit on the entries in order to save their best effort for the New England Division III Championship the following weekend. The plan worked out, but there was a point in both meets when it seemed MIT may have made an error in judgment by not maxing their entries. In the end, the men won with 266 points to 223 for Springfield College while host Coast Guard earned third with 127, followed by WPI with 92, Wheaton with 51 and Babson with 15. The women scored 216.5 points to claim the title while Springfield again took second, scoring 154. Wheaton was third with 103.5 points, followed by Smith College and WPI, both with 77, Wellesley with 68 in their first year in the meet, Coast Guard with 47, Mt. Holyoke with 17 and Babson with 15 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The weather this spring has not been kind on the dates of competition. The strong winds continued as they have all spring, aiding the sprint events but hurting the lap events. With temperatures at 60 degrees and mostly cloudy it was still the best Saturday this spring.
    
    
                  
    
    The men have won this championship every year since 2001, only losing the title once in history and 2011 did not seem to be any different. The meet began with the throwers showing their dominance, taking 1-2-4 in the Hammer Throw, with all three throwing personal bests. Ken Cooper '13, took the title with a throw of 183-1, CK Umachi '12, placed second in 170-11 and high jumper turned thrower, Jeremy Sharpe '14, threw 156-0.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, things also started off great. Matt Weaver '12, injured all season, made his comeback at the right time. As the only entry for MIT in the 10K, while MIT saved their distance runners for the shorter 5K, Weaver felt the pressure to come through and score. No one knew what to expect other than the fact that he would not give up and would compete well. Weaver was not seeded to score since he had not run a race this season. The leaders went out with eventual winner, Brian Fuller of Springfield, which was much too fast a pace for them. Weaver also got pulled a bit too fast at 77 for the first quarter but quickly corrected to running the planned 83 second pace. Spending most of the time back in 11th place, Weaver began catching the fading runners after the second mile. By the final mile Weaver had moved into fourth place. In the final lap he was caught by one runner to end up in fifth, scoring four points for MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    Things then took a turn for the worse. In the Long Jump, Mattias Flander '11, made his return to competing with a 20-11 3/4 effort, good for fourth place. Jordan Mizerak '14, added a point for eighth place, but Travis Hery '11, expected to score well, fouled out. At the same time, the 4x100 Relay, while placing third in 43.28 with a makeshift team, lost star sprinter, Josh Duncavage '12, for the rest of the meet after he tweaked his hamstring. Duncavage was seeded first in both the 100 and 200 and was running a leg on the 4x400. This would not only take major points away from MIT, but would move Springfield up in the scoring.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 3000 Steeplechase, MIT was seeded 1-2-5-6. Sixth seed, Eric Safai '14, had been sick and was not totally recovered, so was not expected to race his best. While Paul Welle '11, and Richard Prevost '11, did their jobs, beating all opponents, Stephen Serene '12, the fifth seed, ran a great race, placing second with a big PR of 9:29.67 to give MIT a 1-2-3 sweep.
    
    
                  
    
    Back in the jumps, Matt Falk '12, seeded in a tie for first, was unable to place better than fourth. In the 100 trials, without Duncavage, MIT had no one make the finals. The 110HH, where MIT was seeded 3-5-6-7 with times much slower than they were all capable of, went even worse with only Nick Leonard '11, and Andrew Musacchio '11, making the finals where they eventually placed third and sixth respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    The bad news got worse in the 1500. MIT was seeded 1-2-4-6 in what is usually MIT's signature event. Kyle Hannon '13, seeded first, but having competitive problems lately, gave up after the first 400, eventually fading to seventh in 4:07.62. Dawit Zewdie '13, saved the day, by winning the race despite being seeded fourth. His vicious kick caught the leaders to win in 4:02.24. Justin Bullock '14, ran an aggressive race, but did too much work in front against the strong wind, finishing in third in 4:03.24.
    
    
                  
    
    The throwing events could not come often enough for MIT. In the Shot Put, Cooper won his second event, claiming first place with a throw of 50-3 1/2. Mitch Kelley '11, came through as well, placing second in 48'. Sharpe came through again, putting the shot 42-7 to earn sixth while Umachi placed eighth. The 22 points were much needed as Springfield was taking too many points on the track. In the Javelin, Vlad Sobes '11, threw a season best to move up from second seed to take the win with a throw of 198-10. Matt Barron '13, also moved up, placing seventh after being seeded eighth. Continuing in the field events, Flander continued to help his teammates, jumping 43-7 3/4 in the Triple Jump to take third place. Jackson Wirekoh '13, jumped a personal best for the second week in succession, taking fifth with a jump of 43-5 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Back to the track, hoping for some good results. In the 400, Tech was seeded third and fifth and teammates were looking to Tyler Singer-Clark '14, and DJ Ronde '13, to stop the bleeding in the running events. While Singer-Clark earned fourth and Ronde seventh, Mac Gager '14, snuck in for a sixth place to keep the expected points the same as what was scored.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT was seeded 1-2-3-8 in the 800, but again was not able to come through with the expected points. Despite the strong wind, Pat Marx '13, took care of business on his end by winning the event going away in 1:56.18. Hannon made a nice return to racing, focusing well for all by 150 meters, to earn third place. Bullock closed well to place fourth.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 400IH, the Engineers took what was expected, a third and sixth. Leonard, looking as though he is ready for the championship season, ran a beautiful first eight hurdles before faltering a little on the final two to fall back to third in a season best of 55.52. Welle returned from the Steeplechase to take sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    Seeded 1-2 in the 200, but minus the top seed in Duncavage, Singer-Clark had to get the job done. While he placed third, he raced well, much better than in the 400. His time of 22.25 was only .02 off his best. The problem was that Springfield was now in the lead after taking the top two places. Of course, MIT still had the Discus Throw and Pole Vault to go as well as the 5000 on the track, all three very big events for Tech. So while not overly concerned, MIT was certainly paying attention and letting their athletes know what had to happen.
    
    
                  
    
    The Discus Throw had MIT seeded to place 1-2-3-5. While it was the only throwing event where MIT lost some expected points, the 1-2-4-6 finish provided 26 points that put MIT far in the lead. Kelley won the event at 155-5 with Umachi taking second in 143-11, Cooper claiming fourth in 136-9 and Sharpe throwing 126-10 for sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    The Pole Vault was taking quite a while to finish and the outcome was keeping the coaching staff wondering about just how close Springfield might be. Seeded 1-2-3-6 after having an excellent week of competition and practice, the vaulters came close to their seeds but not quite. Nathan Peterson '12, jumped a season best of 15-7 to win. Cyrus Vafadari '12, took second at 15-1. Yida Gao '13, seeded third, took sixth at 13-7 1/4 while Hery, seeded sixth, no-heighted. Nevertheless, the 21 points sealed the victory for MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 5000, Dan Harper '12, and Roy Wedge '14, were intending on placing first and second, but were primarily interested in helping to pull Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11 and Ben Mattocks '12, to a New England Division III qualifying time of 15:30. It was not to be however, as both Amarasiriwardena and Mattocks fell off the pace at the 3200 meter mark. Harper and Wedge then ran a 4:45 final mile to pull away from everyone to place 1-2 in 15:10.37 and 15:11.70 respectively. Amarasiriwardena earned sixth and Mattocks eighth to help the team effort.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event, the 4x400 relay was one where MIT knew they needed to improve on their 3:26 season best in order to get into the fast section in next week's championship. With Leonard replacing Duncavage, the team was pumped up to run at least 3:23. Ronde opened up with a 51.8, about what the team expected. Singer-Clark ran well, splitting 50.5. Leonard came through with a 51.5 leg and Marx ran an excellent leg in 49.6 to give MIT second place in 3:23.56.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's meet, with three additional teams had a greater distribution of points, making the prediction of expected points a little more difficult. The women's strengths were much more in the running events with the exception of the Pole Vault.
    
    
                  
    
    Choosing to only put one distance runner in the 10K, MIT was counting on Sarah Sprague '13, to run a smart race and win the event without wearing herself out for next week. Springfield runners set the initial pace, so Sprague was content to sit and let them do the work. As the pace deteriorated to 1:40  400's by the two mile mark, only one Springfield runner continued to lead while the other fell back. Sprague was patient until the end of four miles where she took the lead, eventually winning by 38 seconds in 41:19.78.
    
    
                  
    
    The 4x100 did not start off well, as Martha Gross '12, pulled away from Jackie Brew '14, at the first handoff. However, the team got it back under control although Jamie Simmons '12, handed off to Portia Jones '12, behind, forcing Jones to run her absolute best to pull out the victory in a season best and MIT record of 48.28.
    
    
                  
    
    One of the moves that MIT pulled with the confidence they would pull out the victory was taking Jones out of the 100 and into the 400, an event she had not run outdoors due to the surgery on her hand, thus seeding her into the slow section with no time. In the 100 trials, Brew made the finals but did not run well, due in part to lower leg pain, but also severe allergies. In the 100HH trial, MIT qualified all four participants but they did not look as great as they had in practice.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, the High Jump was just finishing. Megan Bumgarner '14, placed fifth, which was her seed, clearing 5-01. Kristine Bunker '14, nearly cleared 5-01, but had to settle for 4-11, good for seventh place, one place higher than fellow MIT freshman, Jackie Konopka '14, also clearing 4-11.
    
    
                  
    
    Brooke Hamilton '14, favored to win the Shot Put, did not handle that position well, failing to place and throwing six feet less than her best. Hazel Briner '11, was being held out of all of her strong events so that she is fresh next weekend, but did compete in the Shot. Her 35-00 1/2 put earned her a seventh place.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Triple Jump, Karin Fisher '11, only jumped in the trials due to her participation in the Pole Vault, but jumped a personal best of 35-7 1/4 to place second. Brew took fourth place, also on a limited number of jumps.
    
    
                  
    
    The running events continued to go well for Tech. In the 3000 Steeplechase, Martina de Geus '14, ran an excellent race to place second in an MIT freshman record of 11:17.23. Maggie Lloyd '12, went out at a much too aggressive early pace and paid as she came in third in 11:30.83. Right after that, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, Louise van den Heuvel '14, and Alina Gatowski '11, placed 1-3-4 after being seeded 2-3-4-6. The number one seed did not race and Brooke Johnson '13, was ill and unable to make the trip for MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 100HH, Amy Magnuson 'G, returned to national level form, posting a 14.59 for second place. Jones appears to be getting her confidence back in the hurdles after her surgery, placing third in 15.08. Brew claimed third in 15.79 and Bumgarner took fifth.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 400, as thought, Jones was unable to recover completely after the hurdles and had no competition in her section to push her. Her 61.77 was her slowest 400 ever at MIT and only earned her sixth place. Simmons raced well to win in a great time of 57.65, particularly impressive with the strong wind. Gross earned third, but only ran 59.79.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 800, MIT was seeded 4-6-7-8, but without Johnson, they were only expected to get 4-6-7. In the first event on the track that did not go their way, the 800 runners took fifth and sixth but ran well even though they never raced with the leaders. Louise van den Heuvel took fifth in 2:22.64 and Chandler Burfield '13, ran a season best of 2:22.80.
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons was up again, this time in her favorite event, the 400IH. Simmons first five hurdles were excellent despite running into the wind. She faltered a little on the curve and found herself in second coming down the homestretch. In the final 20 meters she pulled ahead to run a season best of 63.22 for the victory. Kirsten Aarsvold '11, ran a season best of 69.32 for eighth and Lloyd came back after the Steeplechase to place eighth in her first ever 400IH, running 69.66.
    
    
                  
    
    Back in the field events, the final two jumping events, the Long Jump and the Pole Vault were finished. Fisher took the Pole Vault at a height of 12-0 3/4. Lauren Kuntz '13, took second in 11-5 3/4 and Kate Wymbs '14 and Becky Stavely '11, both cleared 10-6 to place fourth and fifth. Brew placed fourth in the Long Jump in 16-10 1/2 while Jackie Konopka '14, jumped a personal best of 15-11 1/2 to place eighth.
    
    
                  
    
    Hamilton redeemed herself by placing sixth in the Hammer Throw, a 14 foot personal best at 128-3. In the Discus, Christine Labaza '14, took third place with her 102-7. Only scoring 11 points in the throwing events is an area the Engineers hope to improve on in the next year.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 200, Jones only ran as fast as she needed to in order to win. Her 25.27 got the job done. Although she seems unable to get out well in the 400, often coming through the first 200 in 28+, Gross earned second place with a personal best of 25.40.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 5000, MIT pulled Holt-Gosselin, Gatowski and Sprague, only racing Tania Morimoto '12. The pace was aggressive after a slow first lap, leaving Morimoto and Camille Basurto of Wellesley to decide the outcome. With five laps to go, Morimoto grew tired of the previous two laps of 1:29 each, and took the lead. She came through in a 1:26 to open up a lead, but then started tightening up allowing Basurto to get back in it and then take the lead for good with a lap and a half to go. Morimoto ended up in second, running 18:21.41.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event, the Engineers pulled their A relay and substituted the B relay team of Aarsvold, Bumgarner, Stephanie Ku and Emily Kuo. Aarsvold ran an excellent lead off, splitting 62.0. Bumgarner paced herself well, splitting 61.7 and keeping MIT in second. Ku took the baton and held off the trailing teams for the first 200, but eventually faded to 64.5. Kuo ran 63.9 to put MIT in fourth in 4:12.33.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT hosts the Men's and Women's New England Division III Championship. The Decathlon starts on Thursday, concluding on Friday. The Heptathlon as well as the Discus, Long Jump and 10K are competed on Friday. The conclusion of the Heptathlon and remainder of the meet will be held on Saturday. MIT is the defending runner-up for both men and women. With over 40 teams in the conference it will be difficult, but the Engineers hope to win on their home turf.

    DESPITE POOR WEATHER, ENGINEERS RESPOND WITH OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCES
    
    
                  
    
    April 16, 2011
    
    
                  
    
    MIT hosted their annual Spring Invitational, but the Spring part never really happened. Destined to work with 45 degree temperatures with  extremely strong winds coming off the ocean, the MIT athletes competed at their best, ignoring the conditions the way they always do. The non-scoring meet allowed the Engineers to rest many of their top athletes or put them in other events to qualify them for the upcoming championships.
    
    
                  
    
    Given the strong winds, the biggest PR's came in the sprints as expected. Martha Gross '12, ran the 100 Meters in 12.64 to finish second and Theresa Santiano-McHatton '14, ran 13.43. Josh Duncavage '13, ran 10.94 to break the 11 second barrier for the first time and win the event. Duncavage also ran a PR in the 200 with his 22.22 to claim second.
    
    
                  
    
    In the high hurdles, Megan Bumgarner '14, had her best race of the year, running 15.82 to claim second place to teammate Amy Magnuson 'G, who ran 15:14 despite her poor start. Nick Leonard '11, ran a hand time of 15.2, but the FinishLynx system timed him in 16:00. Nevertheless he won the race and is looking good for the upcoming championships.
    
    
                  
    
    The 400IH, as with all of the lap races, presented a formidable homestretch with a constant strong headwind, sometimes exceeding 30 mph. Jamie Simmons '12, is coming closer to rediscovering her rhythm that got her second place at the NCAA Division III Championship last spring, only having two poor hurdles technically. She ran a season best of 64.20, just barely qualifying provisionally for nationals with her 64.20. Paul Welle '11, the team's premier steeplechaser, debuted in the 400IH and ran quite well, placing fourth in 59.31.
    
    
                  
    
    The 800 was a bright spot for MIT despite the relatively slow times due to the strong winds. The men placed 1-3 as Pat Marx '13, ran a strong race to win in 1:58.48. Justin Bullock '14, normally running the 1500 first, picked the wrong time to try and get a big 800 performance, but raced well to get third in 1:58.87. Louise van den Heuvel '14, ran a great time for the conditions, but was unable to hold on for the win, claiming second instead in 2:22.40. Chandler Burfield '13, continued her comeback as she placed third in 2:25.85.
    
    
                  
    
    Dawit Zewdie '13, ran an excellent 4:02.85 to qualify for the New England Division III Championship. With the high winds, no one was willing to take the pace out hard. Zewdie knew this could be his final opportunity to qualify so he did it by himself. One week after qualifying in the 5K, Zewdie did all the work up front, ultimately setting himself up to be out kicked and settling for third place. On the women's side, Brooke Johnson '13, coming back from her injury, also took matters into her own hands, running 4:55.03 for second as she was out kicked in the end. Maggie Lloyd '12, ran a great race, PR'ing in 4:56.19.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 3000 Meter Steeplechase there was very little incentive to push the pace. Richard Prevost '11, took the race with two laps to go, running 9:46.21 to win easily. Christian Reed '14, made his debut with a 10:23.99 effort for seventh.
    
    
                  
    
    Alina Gatowski '11, wanted to run a fast 5K time, and did, but not as fast as she wanted, running 17:54.32 to claim second place. Tania Morimoto '12, raced well, although there was really no one to race at the pace she needed. Nevertheless, she ran 18:18.93 to show she is back and running well. In the men's race, Stephen Serene '12, Ben Mattocks '12, and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, had it as their goal to qualify for the New England Division III Championship, which require a 15:30 or better. The wind was not relenting so the runners took the pace out, but had difficulty maintaingin the pace. The first mile was 4:53 but the second mile 5:04. With 800 to go, they were in need of a sub 2:20 final two laps in order to qualify. Serene was the only one to pull it off, running 64 for the final 400 to claim first in 15:27.14.
    
    
                  
    
    The mixed gender 10K only had two MIT entries, Dan Harper '12, and Roy Wedge '14. In the New England Division III Championship, the women can qualify for the 10K with a 5K qualifying time, whereas the men have to meet the 10K qualifying standard with a 10K time, which required 33:40 or better. The two distance aces were not concerned about hitting the time, even in the windy conditions. Knocking out 79 second quarters, the pair hit the first 5K in 16:30 and closed slightly faster. Harper ran 32:41.30 to win and Wedge took it easy, running 32:47.85 for second.
    
    
                  
    
    Both teams fielded 4x800 squads, but again only for the sake of securing a time to guarantee getting into the fast section of the New England Division III Championship. The women, running van den Heuvel (2:24), Martina de Geus '14, (2:30), Lloyd (2:26) and Johnson (2:27), won by 40 seconds in 9:48.67, running alone the entire race. The men were also alone the entire race, winning in 8:12.61 with splits of 2:01 for Prevost, 2:02 from Bullock, 2:05 from Zewdie and a 2:03 from Kyle Hannon '13.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, MIT could not take full advantage of the wind, and the athletes had to endure the cold much longer due to multiple events and the breaks between efforts. In the Pole Vault, the Tufts University vaulters put it to the MIT vaulters as the Jumbos went 1-2 with Nakanishi clearing 15-7 3/4. Cyrus Vafadari '12, jumped well for MIT, claiming third at 14-7 1/4, but teammate Nathan Peterson '12 was not able to clear a height. Karin Fisher '11, won easily, nearly clearing 12-7 1/2, but settling for 12-3 1/2. Lauren Kuntz '13, was second at 11-5 3/4 and Hazel Briner fourth at 10-11 3/4. Kate Wymbs '14, Becky Stavely '11, and Lynn Jepsen '11, all cleared 10-6 for Tech.
    
    
                  
    
    In the throws, Brooke Hamilton '14, had a good day, throwing a PR 37-9 1/2 in the Shot Put, and a personal best of 86-3 in the Javelin. For the men, Jeremy Sharpe '14, saw the only improvements on the day, throwing nice personal bests in the Shot at 41-8 and the Hammer with a throw of 137-0.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, the Heptathlon and Decathlon athletes will compete in their respective events at the Holy Cross meet on Wednesday and Thursday. A couple of the distance runners will go to Princeton to compete in the Sam Ellis Distance Festival on Friday night. Most of the team will travel to Springfield College for an invitational on Saturday while some MIT athletes will rest for the NEWMAC Conference Championship the following weekend, a meet the men have not lost since 2000, while the women will be going for their third consecutive championship.

    MIT Experiences Mixed Results at Point Loma Spring Break Meet
    
    
                  
    
    March 26-27, 2011
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Track & Field team traveled to California for their spring break trip from March 20-27, staying in Claremont while training at Pomona Pitzer Colleges for the first half of the week and competing at the Point Loma Nazarene Spring Invitational on the weekend. However, prior to leaving for California, a few MIT distance runners competed in the Northeastern College Invitational to get some qualifying times out of the way.
    
    
                  
    
    At Northeastern University, Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, fresh off of her 5K All America performance indoors, competed in, won and qualified for the NCAA Championships in the 10K, running a new MIT record of 36:02.79. On the men's side, Paul Welle '11, and Richard Prevost '11, both qualified for the New England Division III 5000 in placing 1-2 with respective times of 15:17.18 and 15:23.45. Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, competed in the 10K, also qualifying for the New England Division III Championship with his 32:43.48.
    
    
                  
    
    In California, the team arrived to a virtual flood in LA, as many inches of rain fell that day. While it continued to rain each day of the week except Tuesday, it did not affect the practices or meet with the exception of part of Monday's practice. The temperatures in the low 60's all week were unseasonable but a welcome change from what New England was experiencing.
    
    
                  
    
    Due to economic constraints, MIT only competed with 13 men and 14 women in the 12 team meet, while the other teams had a full compliment of athletes. Those who traveled were those who needed the outdoor track and warm environment to benefit in the skill events. Outside of the relays, hurdles and Steeplechase events, MIT only brought one middle-distance runner. The meet scored 19 places (20 down to 1, skipping 19) with no team allowed more than two point scorers per event. MIT was at such a disadvantage they just focused on strong performances, not scoring points.
    
    
                  
    
    The meet began on Friday with the Hammer Throw. The MIT men wasted no time in showing dominance as Ken Cooper '13, and CK Umachi '12 went 1-2 with throws of 166-6 and 165-8 respectively. On the women's side, Brooke Hamilton '14, debuted in the Hammer with a throw of 114-4.
    
    
                  
    
    On Saturday, MIT continued to do well in the throwing events on the men's side. Vlad Sobes '11, placed second in the Javelin with his 190-10 NCAA provisional qualifying mark. In the Shot Put, Cooper won his second event, throwing 46-9. Mitch Kelley '11, could not get his right foot under him and opened up too soon every throw, not coming close to his personal best of 49', settling for a third place with his 44-00 3/4. Kelley did much better in his favorite event, the Discus, where he won with an NCAA provisional qualifying mark of 162-6. Umachi supported with a second place 149-0 personal best and even though he could not count in the scoring as MIT's third performer, Cooper threw an excellent 143-9, finishing fourth among the throwers. Hamilton was also the lone MIT thrower for the women in the Shot Put and Discus. In the Shot, Hamilton finished fourth in 37-06 3/4. She also placed eighth in the Discus Throw with a 103-8 performance. In the Javelin, heptathletes, Hazel Briner '11 and Jackie Konopka '14 joined Hamilton. Konopka came out on top for MIT with a throw of 89-7.
    
    
                  
    
    In the jumps, MIT continued to show their dominance in the Pole Vault. Nathan Peterson '12, cleared 15-6 to win the event while Cyrus Vafadari '12, cleared 14-0 to place seventh. For the women, Karin Fisher '11 and Hazel Briner '11, claimed the top two spots with vaults of 12-0 and 11-7 1/4 respectively. Lauren Kuntz '13, would have placed third with her 11-6 vault but was not allowed to score as the third MIT vaulter. In the High Jump, Matt Falk '12, cleared 6-3 1/4 to place sixth overall and Umachi showed his versatility by jumping 5-11 1/4. Megan Bumgarner '14, tied a freshman record with her sixth place 5-1 jump. Briner and Konopka supported with jumps of 4-9. MIT did not bring any male horizontal jumpers, so gave up significant points in those two events. Jackie Brew '14, started her dominant meet with a long jump victory at 17-3 1/2 and backed that up by winning the Triple Jump with a jump of 34-9 1/2. Fisher showed she can do much more than vault by claiming fourth at 33-4 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    In the sprints, MIT held their own. Josh Duncavage '13, won the 100 in 11.09. Babajide Akinronbi '14, would have placed well but pulled up at the 70 meter mark with a hamstring strain. Duncavage teamed with Tyler Singer-Clark '14, who came back after placing third in his 400 debut with a 49.96, to place fifth and fourth respectively in 22.63 and 22.66. In addition, the 4x100 relay of Duncavage, Nick Leonard '11, Singer-Clark and Akinronbi placed second with a fine early season time of 42.97. For the women, Brew won her third event when she set a new MIT freshman record in the 100 with an excellent 12.60. In the 200, Portia Jones '11, surpassed the NCAA auto standard with her second place 24.44 despite a sprained ligament in her thumb (affecting her start) and abrasion on her cheek from a nasty fall in the 100HH earlier. Martha Gross '12, came back from a 59.56 fourth place in the 400 to support Jones in the 200 with a 26.46, just ahead of Brew in 26.54. The quartet of Brew, Gross, Jamie Simmons '12, and Jones ran a very nice NCAA provisional qualifying time of 48.49 to place third in the 4x100 relay. Gross left a step and a half early to cause a slow-down when she ran away from Brew, but overall the handoffs were very solid.
    
    
                  
    
    In the hurdle events, things did not go quite as well as planned. Duncavage ran a personal best of 16.01, but still no where near his potential. Leonard was not driving his hips through the hurdles and ran a 16.30, far off his best. Leonard had a rough outing in the 400IH as well, running 58.23. MIT's strongest hurdle event for the men, the 3000 Steeplechase, was cancelled due to the carpet in the water pit coming unglued and creating a safety hazard. The women did not fair much better. With All America hurdlers Jones and Amy Magnuson 'G, MIT expected to dominate the 100HH. However, Jones did not sprint well between the early hurdles and when she tried to catch up to the leader her lead leg went just under the top of the hurdle causing a very nasty fall. Magnuson, just behind had to stop to keep from stepping on Jones, losing too much to place. Brew came through with a third place 15.77 and Briner placed sixth in 16.07. In the 400IH, Simmons, hoping to qualify for Nationals, could not get her rhythm as she went out too slow and had troubles with the majority of the hurdles. She settled for a third place 65.63. Bumgarner added a 71.10 as she was just too apprehensive in attacking the event in the early going. In the Steeplechase, Martina de Geus '14, was never in the race as her legs felt fatigued from the gun. Her 11:57.55 earned her fifth place as she was passed at the finish line by two runners.
    
    
                  
    
    Not able to run the Steeplechase, Paul Welle '11, instead competed in the 1500 and 800. Welle set personal bests in both events, running 4:00.70 and 1:56.70 respectively. Welle has now qualified for the New England Division III Championship in the 800, 1500 and 5K, only lacking his main event, the Steeplechase. Louise van den Heuvel '14, also competed in the 1500 and 800. In the 1500, she was unable to mount a kick, but the fast early pace was likely part of the reason. Her 4:47.56 earned her fifth place overall and was close to an MIT freshman record. In the 800, van den Heuvel only managed 10th place, but did earn the freshman record with her 2:21.83. De Geus supported with a 2:27.47 effort.
    
    
                  
    
    At the end of an eight and a half hour day, the women's 4x400 got on the track, looking to at least qualify provisionally for the NCAA Championship. Simmons started things off pretty well although she did not get out quite as fast as she should have. Simmons handed off to Briner in third place in 58.0. Briner got out very well, but did not seem to have much in the final 200 as she finished in 60.3, at least two seconds slower than expected. Gross left early on the fatigued Briner, eventually slowing down to a crawl before stretching Briner out to make the pass. Running with her back to the finish line in order to receive the baton, by the time Gross received the baton and turned around she ran into the back of the previous incoming runner, causing a further delay. What was a 10 meter gap to second place was now 30 meters. This fact seemed to further affect Gross, who only managed a 61.6. Jones was too far down to do much, but her 57.6 was respectable given the circumstances. 
    
    
                  
    
    Overall, the women finished third out of 12 teams with 390 points. The men finished fourth out of 12 with 346 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT is at home in the Engineer's Cup versus RPI and WPI on Saturday, April 2 with the meet starting at 12:00.
