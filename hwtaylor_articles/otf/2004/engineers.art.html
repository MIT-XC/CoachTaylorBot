  <p><strong><font size="+3">DISTANCE RUNNERS SHINE IN LOSING EFFORT</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 3, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">The times have changed in the track and field scene at MIT but 
    it is nice to know that at least some things stay the same. Already suffering 
    their second loss of the season after going two years without a loss, MIT 
    is trying to come to grips with having so few bodies in the field events. 
    However, the distance runners, silent most of the year, made themselves heard 
    loud and clear in Troy, NY on Saturday.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT lost by the largest amount in recent history to a strong 
    and well balanced RPI team by a score of 225.5 to 122.5, even though they 
    did beat WPI with a score of 55 points. The potential scoring per event was 
    22 points with a point distribution of 7-5-4-3-2-1 for places 1-6. The eight 
    field events only accumulated 27.5 points for MIT and Uzoma Orji garnered 
    17 of them. Orji saved his best effort for last with a new MIT outdoor record 
    of 56-1. The only other win in the field events for MIT came from Nate Ball 
    who cleared 14-11 to claim the pole vault.</p>
  <p align="left">By contrast, in the four events that comprise the 800-5000 meters, 
    MIT took 58 points from the other engineering schools. Without Brian Anderson, 
    who is still recovering from his glute/hamstring injury from the indoor season, 
    MIT won the 1500, 3000SC and 5000 meter runs. In the 1500, John Brewer led 
    a 1-2-3 sweep with a well run 4:07.85 effort. Fivos Constantinou followed 
    closely with a 4:09.82 and Carlos Renjifo closed strongly to finish in 4:10.75. 
    In the steeplechase, Ben Schmeckpeper took the lead at the gun and never looked 
    back. Schmeckpeper ran 9:37.89 despite stuttering before most of the barriers, 
    causing him to lose a lot of time. Rookies Chris Fidkowski, Robby Bryant and 
    Kevin DiGenova placed third, fifth and sixth with times of 10:15.49, 10:29.66 
    and 10:57.44 respectively. The 5000 offered another MIT sweep as Eric Khatchadourian 
    put together the race he has sought all year, running a huge personal best 
    of 15:45.69. Running with Khatchadourian for the two miles, Kevin Brulois 
    also ran a personal best of 15:52.26 for second place. Ian Driver also put 
    together his best race of the year with a third place 16:07.91.</p>
  <p align="left">The 800 did not provide an MIT victory, but the 1500 runners 
    and Schmeckpeper returned to claim 2-3-5-6. Renjifo led the way with a PR 
    of 2:00.20 and was followed by Brewer with another PR of 2:01.03. Schmeckpeper 
    kicked by Constantinou in 2:03.07 for his year's best 800.</p>
  <p align="left">The only other victory for MIT came in the 200 when Zach Traina 
    won his specialty in 22.73. The sprinters held their own by claiming second 
    in the 400 relay with a time of 43.78 and by claiming third, fifth and sixth 
    in the 100.</p>
  <p align="left">If Tom Hoover, Nestor Hernandez and Anderson return some of 
    the holes for MIT should be filled in nicely. MIT is at home next Saturday 
    with an 11:00 start against Bowdoin, UMass Lowell and Tufts.</p>
