  <p><strong><font size="+3">ORJI SETS VARSITY RECORD WITH ALL AMERICA PERFORMANCE 
    IN SHOT PUT</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 29, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">By Todd Chamoy (assistant coach)</p>
  <p align="left">MIT sent a small contigent of athletes to compete at the NCAA 
    Division III Outdoor Championships last weekend. Uzoma Orji had qualified 
    for the hammer throw and shot put, while Nate Ball had qualified for the pole 
    vault.</p>
  <p align="left">Seeded 15th of 15 athletes in the strongest field ever in the 
    hammer, Uzoma had nowhere to go but up. For the first time ever, the flights 
    were seeded with the bottom half of the athletes in the first flight and the 
    top half in the second flight. This would mean Uzoma would be throwing right 
    away, then waiting to see how the second flight turned out to determine his 
    place.</p>
  <p align="left">He opened with a safe throw around 165', which we knew would 
    not be good enough to make the finals. On his second attempt, he started off 
    in good position, but did not counter sufficiently as he picked up speed, 
    so the hammer pulled him over and he hit the circle with the ball and fouled 
    the throw. On his third attempt, he put together a solid, but painfully slow 
    three turns to throw 171'9&quot;, leaving him in fourth place in his flight.</p>
  <p align="left">Considering there were eight athletes yet to throw who all had 
    qualifying marks over 180', with only nine athletes making the final, we were 
    not optimistic. We watched the second flight in anguish, almost hoping the 
    other throwers would just put us out of our misery, but in an improbable turn 
    of events, two of the athletes in the second flight tied Uzoma's mark of 171'9&quot;, 
    and part way through the third round, the three throwers remained tied for 
    9th place. Unfortunately, the struggling thrower from Willamette came through 
    on his third throw to knock Uzoma, et al, down to 10th place and out of the 
    finals.</p>
  <p align="left">Earlier in the day, Nate Ball began vaulting in his second national 
    championships, a meet which has not gone well for him in the past. His freshman 
    year, he qualified as the 16th of 16 in the field, then proceeded to no-height 
    for a disappointing end to an incredible season. His sophomore year, he qualified 
    again, but came down with mono late in the season and was forced to withdraw 
    from the meet. A series of injuries had kept him from qualifying for the indoor 
    national championships, so he entered this meet hoping to reverse an incredible 
    spell of bad luck.</p>
  <p align="left">Nate's day started as well as possible, clearing 14'7&quot; 
    and 15'1&quot; on first attempts. After knocking the bar off on his first 
    jump at 15'7&quot;, he gathered himself for a great jump to clear the height 
    on his second attempt. Six athletes had cleared the height on their first 
    attempt, and Hans Schmidt, the national record holder, had yet to start jumping, 
    leaving Nate unofficially in eighth place. The coaching staff was supremely 
    confident that Nate would end up at worst in eighth, but we had discounted 
    a freshman from Wilmington who had miraculously scraped over 15'7 1/4&quot; 
    on his third attempt. After most of the field, including Nate, missed at 16'1&quot;, 
    the freshman from Wilmington again miraculously scrapes over the bar, moving 
    him from 9th place to 3rd, and moving Nate from 8th place to 9th, assuming 
    the defending national champion does not no-height.<br>
    Hope was held out a little longer than it should have been, as Hans missed 
    his first attempt at 16'7&quot;. He barely cleared on his second attempt, 
    but a clear is a clear, and Nate was now officially ninth. Sadly, the single 
    miss at 15'7 1/4&quot; cost Nate a tie for 4th, but after all the drama he 
    experienced in the last three years, we were all very happy with his performance.</p>
  <p align="left">We returned to the track on Saturday for Uzoma's best event, 
    the shot put. After having won the meet by three feet indoors, we had high 
    hopes. We were not as confident this time around, as he was only seeded 4th, 
    and the previous weekend had nearly fouled out. Also, the top seed,Cody Brotherton 
    from McMurry, happened to be the defending outdoor champion. After sitting 
    through a weak first flight (the entire first flight would not have qualified 
    for last year's championships), Uzoma started his warm-up and showed that 
    today would be a big day. His stand throw hit around 53', farther than anyone 
    in the first flight had thrown, and his second full warm-up throw hit the 
    60' line, eliciting &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;aahs&quot; from the crowd.</p>
  <p align="left">On his first throw, Uzoma throws a casual 56'5&quot; to take 
    a big lead, but Brotherton responds with a 57'4&quot; on his first throw. 
    The second time through, Uzoma hits 58'10 1/4&quot; to take an even bigger 
    lead, and Brotherton begins his traditional long string of fouls. As a spinner, 
    Brotherton is fairly inconsistent, but when he does hit one, it goes a long 
    way. Uzoma does not improve on his mark in the third round, but still throws 
    the second farthest throw of the competition so far with a 58'7&quot;. Meanwhile, 
    John Schuna, the third former national champion in the competition, had thrown 
    58'6&quot; to move into second place.</p>
  <p align="left">In the finals, Uzoma and Schuna continued to throw far but not 
    improve on their marks from the preliminaries, while Brotherton continues 
    to foul. Finally, at the end of the sixth and last round, when we can finally 
    start to taste the victory, Brotherton throws 59'1&quot; to take the lead. 
    Schuna and Uzoma are unable to respond, and the day ends with Uzoma in second 
    place.</p>
  <p align="left">Obviously we had hoped for victory, but considering he threw 
    a two foot season best, and he did not even qualify for last year's outdoor 
    nationals, we had to be satisfied with his performance. Uzoma will have his 
    work cut out for him in both the hammer and shot next year, as five of this 
    year's hammer All-Americans are returning, as well as Cody Brotherton on the 
    shot put.</p>
