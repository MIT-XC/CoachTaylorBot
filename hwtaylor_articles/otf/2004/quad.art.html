  <p><strong><font size="+3">TRAINA SPRINTS BACK TO TOP FORM</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT Continues to Struggle With Lack of Depth</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">April 10, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">For the first time in since the 1970s, MIT outdoor track has 
    a losing season. Entering the meet against Bowdoin College, Tufts University 
    and Division II powerhouse UMass Lowell, host MIT needed to defeat two of 
    the teams to finish with a winning record. Even though the 2004 team lacks 
    depth, the familiar tradition of never giving up and doing anything possible 
    for the team is obvious. However, try as they might, there just weren't enough 
    entries on the MIT side of the ledger to get the wins. Ending up on the low 
    end of the score with 125 points to UMass Lowell's 196, Tufts' 172 and Bowdoin's 
    165 did nothing to slow up Zach Traina who won both the 100 and 200 meter 
    sprint events.</p>
  <p align="left">Traina started his day by leading off the 4x100 relay to a season 
    best of 43.32. In the 100, Traina had an average start but soon pulled away, 
    taking advantage of the wind conditions to run 10.92. Later in the meet, despite 
    tightening up a bit in the final twenty meters, Traina nevertheless held off 
    his competitors to win by over two tenths in 21.81.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji also scored big points to help the MIT cause when 
    he claimed first in the hammer throw with a toss of 166-8 and then came back 
    in the discus to place second with a throw of 146-6. In his specialty, the 
    shot put, Orji proved the point that you always take a safety throw on your 
    first effort to guarantee not fouling out when he fouled in the circle on 
    his first and second efforts and then fouled outside the sector on a standing 
    throw to foul out for the first time in his MIT career. Even a standing throw 
    for Orji would have won by over five feet.</p>
  <p align="left">The only other event winner for MIT was Nate Ball in the pole 
    vault. Ball easily won with a successful vault at 14-6. Ball came close to 
    15-0 but the strong winds made vaulting a little difficult and unpredictable. 
    The vault was MIT's best event as they scored 22 out of a possible 37 points 
    using the 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 scoring system. Josh Chartier placed second with 
    a vault of 13-6 and Nestor Hernandez, vaulting for the first time since early 
    February when he injured his hamstring, cleared 12-6. Thad Wozniak, working 
    on his decathlon events, placed eighth with a clearance of 8-6.</p>
  <p align="left">The sprints were dominant events for Tech as well. Supporting 
    Traina's efforts, were David Blau, second in the 100 with 11.24 and seventh 
    in the 200 with 22.85, and Jonathan Hsieh and Marcus Carson in the 100 with 
    times of 11.52 and 11.60 respectively. In addition, the foursome claimed second 
    in the 400 relay.</p>
  <p align="left">The distance runners held their own in the 1500 and 3000 steeplechase 
    despite the lack of Brian Anderson. John Brewer led the way in the 1500 with 
    a third place effort of 4:05.95. Fivos Constantinou put his back pain out 
    of his mind to place sixth with 4:09.29. Running in the slow section, Eric 
    Khatchadourian led from start to finish, running into the strong wind for 
    a personal best of 4:10.48 and seventh place overall.</p>
  <p align="left">Carlos Renjifo ran the steeplechase for the first time this 
    year, placing fourth in 10:01.08 despite a fall in the middle of the race 
    while on pace to run in the 9:30s. Running personal bests were Chris Fidkowski, 
    who placed fifth with 10:05.17 and Robby Bryant, who placed seventh with 10:14.26.</p>
  <p align="left">Even though he did not place, the personal best of 15:35.41 
    in the 5000 by Kevin Brulois was a big breakthrough for the freshmen.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT travels to Northeastern University's Dedham campus 
    to compete in an invitational starting at 10:00 AM.</p>
