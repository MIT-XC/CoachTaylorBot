  <p><strong><font size="+3">ORJI'S POINTS AND DISTANCE RUNNER'S PR's LEAD THE 
    WAY </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 7-8, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">The MIT men's track and field team continued their championship 
    ways at the New England Intercollegiate Amateur Athletics Association (NEICAAA) 
    annual outdoor track and field championship held at Northeastern University's 
    Dedham facility. Led by Uzoma Orji in the throwing events and the distance 
    runners in the 3000 steeplechase and 10K, MIT scored 19 points in a meet where 
    they were only trying to get some people qualified for nationals.</p>
  <p align="left">Coach Halston Taylor made the decision early in the week not 
    to try to push those who did not have a chance to qualify for the NCAA Championship 
    later in the month, and let them focus on their academics. After two successive 
    brilliant team and individual efforts it was time to just focus on the few 
    who have a chance to move on in the championships or who really wanted to 
    finish with a better performance. This meant not entering Thad Wozniak in 
    the decathlon where he would have been seeded second and not having Orji throw 
    the discus where he was seeded fifth. The discus has not been going extremely 
    well for Orji and it has been taking away from his shot and hammer, so pursuing 
    the event just for points in this meet did not make good sense.</p>
  <p align="left">Orji started things off in the shot put. After a 58+ warmup 
    he launched a safety throw of 56-10. This got everyone excited for things 
    to come. However, he was unable to stay off his right heel in the power position 
    and lost transition speed on every throw. Nevertheless, Orji finished third 
    for six points. Immediately afterward, Orji went to the hammer where he found 
    his rhythm that was missing last week. However, he was still losing speed 
    as he failed to flex his left knee when entering the turns. His throw of 176-8 
    was his second best of the season and was good for fifth place and four points.</p>
  <p align="left">On the track, Eric Khatchadourian was running the 10K, hoping 
    to redeem himself from last weekend and score some points while he was at 
    it. The pace began slow at 80 seconds per lap for the first two miles. The 
    pace picked up in the third mile and Khatchadourian went with it although 
    he was slowly falling back in the pack. His pace was good and he knew to be 
    patient. Sure enough, the lead pack began to break up just before four miles 
    and Khatchadourian took advantage as he ran his fourth mile in 5:09 to begin 
    to close on seventh place. His 5:06 fifth mile brought him to fifth place 
    and he was closing in on the second through fourth. As those he was trying 
    to catch began to battle amongst themselves they began to pull away again. 
    Khatchadourian ran a 5:08 last mile and finished with a 73 last quarter to 
    run a PR of 32:18.90, good for fifth place.</p>
  <p align="left">Also on the track, Brian Anderson continued his comeback effort 
    in the 800. He ran the first 400 in 55 and was in perfect position for a run 
    at the heat victory. However, he lost focus between 500 and 600 meters and 
    found himself out of the race by the time he woke up and decided to run. His 
    finish in 1:56.33 was a compelling argument to continue the comeback effort 
    but with only two weeks to go it might be a case of too little, too late.</p>
  <p align="left">On day two, the steeplechasing trio of Ben Schmeckpeper, Chris 
    Fidkowski and Carlos Renjifo were hoping to run PR's and try to score out 
    of the slow section. Schmeckpeper in particular was trying to run a national 
    qualifying time but was not too confident he could do it by himself out of 
    the slower section. Schmeckpeper took the lead in the first lap and ran 75 
    second quarters for the first mile. Fidkowski and Renjifo were running ambitiously 
    but seemed comfortable with 5:06 at the mile mark. Schmeckpeper continued 
    to pull away through six laps but then ran 79 for the seventh lap before getting 
    it together for a last 200 of 36 and a five second victory over Fidkowski 
    and sixth place overall. Fidkowski slowed to 79 for laps five and six but 
    then really came on with a final lap and a half in 1:49 for a huge PR of 9:33.88. 
    Renjifo ran the biggest personal best of all, improving 16 seconds to 9:39.14 
    for fourth place in the section and 12th place overall.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina, who had qualified for the 200 finals the day before 
    in 22.09, did not get a good start and fell behind right away. Despite a strong 
    closing 100 Traina was not able to place higher than seventh..</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT will take the weekend off with the exception 
    of Nate Ball. Ball will travel to Williamstown to compete in the pole vault 
    in the ECAC meet. The remainder of MIT's contingent will wait until the May 
    22 Last Chance Qualifier at home.</p>
