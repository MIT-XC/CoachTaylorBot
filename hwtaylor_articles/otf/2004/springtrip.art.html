<p align="center"><strong><font size="+3">ORJI AND BALL QUALIFY FOR NATIONALS 
  DURING SPRING BREAK MEETS</font></strong></p>
<p>March 24-27, 2004</p>
<p>The MIT men's track and field team took advantage of the exceptional Florida 
  weather and had a solid week of training in preparation for the upcoming spring 
  season back in New England. In the midst of the training, the team found time 
  to compete in two invitational meets held at the National Triathlon Center in 
  Clermont. Both meets were scoring meets but MIT did not compete their middle 
  distance and distance runners in the first meet and chose to work on specific 
  goals rather than score points when half the team was back at MIT.</p>
<p>The first meet was held on Wednesday. A very strong wind encouraged the meet 
  management to run the 100, 110HH and 200 in the opposite direction to take advantage 
  of the situation. Although Zach Traina was hand timed in 10.4 to win the 100, 
  an accurate time was not available since the automatic timing system did not 
  catch the start. It is assumed by those in attendance that this time was not 
  accurate despite the strong tailwind. In fact, all four MIT sprinters, Traina, 
  David Blau, Marcus Carson and Jonathan Hsieh were all timed under 11.00.</p>
<p>Carson also ran the 110HH and despite hitting nearly every hurdle, still managed 
  to run 16.69 for his first effort ever at the 110HH at the 42&quot; height. 
  Thad Wozniak, putting together a decathlon score by competing in five events 
  in this meet as well as the other five in Saturday's meet, ran a PR of 17.05. 
  Wozniak also had outstanding performances in his other events, long jumping 
  19-4, putting the shot 33-6, throwing the javelin 130-5 and running the 400 
  in 53.08.</p>
<p>Nate Ball and Josh Chartier claimed first and second in the pole vault by clearing 
  14-0 and 12-6 respectively. Chartier allegedly cleared 13-0 but the results 
  only had him listed at the 12-6 height. </p>
<p>Uzoma Orji, getting back to basics after winning the national shot put title 
  a week and a half ago, only managed 54-2 1/2 in the shot. Of course, while this 
  seems like a trivial distance for Orji, it was an outdoor PR as well as a new 
  MIT record. Uzoma also had a PR in the hammer when he got in a throw of 170-4 
  before the called the event due to darkness.</p>
<p>On the track, Traina also claimed victory in the 200 with a modest time of 
  22.57. The surprise of the 200 was Jesse Collins, who after winning the 400 
  in 52.65, came back and placed third in 23.39. The 400 relay team won, but due 
  to poor handoffs and the ferocious wind, only managed 45.42.</p>
<p>The Saturday meet was different in just about every respect. The temperatures 
  were in the 80s and there was only a slight wind. The competition was much better 
  as well. The 400 relay team lessened their mistakes and ran 43.57, which is 
  a much more representative time at this point in the season. </p>
<p>Uzoma Orji led the way with three victories, claiming first place in the shot 
  put, discus and hammer events. His first event, the discus, Orji threw 154-5 
  for a personal best. There are many things to correct in this event for the 
  sophomore so keep your eyes open for big improvements by next season, if not 
  late this season. In his main event, the shot put, he did not have a very good 
  day. His winning toss of 53-5 3/4 was less than a couple of fouls in the 55-56 
  foot area, but it would have to do on this day. Eight hours after the discus 
  began, Orji began his hammer warmup. There was a further delay when a Cornell 
  College athlete, who was spectating and in a dangerous area, got hit in the 
  back of the shoulder by a hammer. The athlete was determined to be okay by medical 
  personnel about 1/2 hour later and the warmup continued. Only getting four throws 
  due to the onset of darkness, Orji made the most of his efforts, throwing 177-4 
  on his third throw. Orji provisionally qualified for naitonals in both the shot 
  and hammer and narrowly missed qualifying in the discus.</p>
<p>MIT went 1-2 in the pole vault, led by Nate Ball's national qualifying performance 
  of 15-9 1/4. This almost did not happen as events seemed to conspire against 
  him. Earlier, another vaulter broke the cross bar and a very long delay was 
  necessary to come up with another cross bar. Once the event started up again, 
  it seemed to just get going when Ball broke his pole on an attempt at 14-6 due 
  to a fast approach, not jumping up and being a little inside his normal takeoff 
  position. Despite the stinger he received and a couple of blooday knuckles, 
  Ball jumped on his next biggest pole and easily cleared the height. Josh Chartier 
  cleared 13-6 for second place.</p>
<p>Thad Wozniak continued his decathlon qualifying effort with day two of decathlon 
  events. Both the discus and pole were at the same time so be rushed to get a 
  height in in the pole vault then hurried to compete in the discus. He cleared 
  8' in the pole vault and threw 93' in the discus. After a short break he had 
  to begin the high jump and managed a height of 4' before he had to run the 1500. 
  Given the heat and the quick first quarter pace, Wozniak did well to run 5:06.47. 
  He then proceeded to cool down just enough to be able to go over and clear 5' 
  in the high jump. Finally, in the 100, he ran 11.78 on his fourth attempt. The 
  camera was not functioning well and they had to recall the race three times, 
  once after the runners had actually completed the race. One would think this 
  would be enough for any athlete in a single day, but Wozniak asked to compete 
  in the javelin as well, throwing a PR of 144'. His cumulative score of 5028 
  easily qualifies him for the New England Division III Championship in five weeks.</p>
<p>Other top marks for the day were provided by John Brewer's 4:09.8 in the 1500 
  and his 2:02.18 in the 800, Zach Traina's 22.61 in the 200 after his debut 400 
  of 51.84, Jesse Collins 51.61 in the 400, David Blau's 11.37 in the 100, despite 
  the fact that it was his 4th 100, Kevin DiGenova's debut 3000 Steeplechase of 
  11:04 and Kevin Brulois's 16:06.0 5000.</p>
<p>Next Saturday MIT travels to RPI for the Engineer's Cup against RPI and WPI.</p>
