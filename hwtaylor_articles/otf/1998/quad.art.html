<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In an impressive rebound from last week's loss to RPI, the
Engineers scorched the State o' Maine on Saturday at Steinbrenner
Stadium.  Senior Captain Ravi Sastry put up some big numbers,
collecting three wins, in the Long Jump (22'2.5"), 100 Meter Dash
(:11.0), and 110 Meter Hurdles (:14.9) -- all in personal record (PR)
times -- to go with thirds in the 200 (:23.1, another PR) and High
Jump (5'10"), for a total of 18.5 points.</P>

<P>Junior Leif Seed posted a double victory as well, first exploding
away from the 1500 Meter field with a sub-60 final lap, and then
storming to a big win in the 400 Meter Hurdles in PR time (:56.4). In
all, MIT captured 11 first places, to Colby's 5, Bowdoin's 2, and
Bates' 1.</P>

<P>MIT started slowly, and actually trailed Colby after 3 events
(9-11).  Mike Parkins '99 got the team rolling with his powerful
late-race surge to win the 3000 Meter Steeplechase in a NE3-leading
9:28.5. </P>

<P>Seed then led a 1-2-4 charge in the 1500, with Chris McGuire '00
2nd (4:08.50), and Sohail Husain '98 a close 4th in a PR 4:10.10.</P>

<P>Sastry, fresh from his long jump win, romped in his specialty 110H
race, with Junius Ho '01 racing well for a solid 4th (:16.1 PR), and
MIT's momentum was hitting stride. </P>

<P>Sean Montgomery '01 (:51.2) and Neal Karchem '99 (:51.7) chopped
chunks off last week's times with strong races.  Their 3rd and 4th
place finishes gave the team the points needed to prevent any big
moves by their northern opponents.</P>

<P>Captain Rav then put paid to any ambitions the Maine men might
have had by ambushing the flat sprinters with a big win in the
century, and the Beavers never looked back.</P>

<P>Kalpak Kothari '01 produced the biggest stun of the meet, PR'ing
by more than a foot (42'6.25"), and defeating Bates' NE3 Indoor
Champion.  Sam Thibault '00 got his second best TJ of his career
(40'8.75") and took 4th.</P>

<P>When Joel Ford '98 (1:58.4) and John Biesiadecki (1:59.6) routed
the 800 field,  and Seed had blasted away the 400 Meter Hurdles race,
the Beavers had opened a  22-point margin over Colby, with Bates and
Bowdoin well behind.</P>

<P>As in the 400, the 200 tandem of Sastry (:23.1) and Todd
Rosenfield '01 (:23.3) kept the wolves from the door, as both posted
PR' s for 3rd and 4th.</P>

<P>There were three times in the meet (the High Jump being the third)
when MIT took 3-4 and the opponents split 1-2, holding their gain to
a minimum 2 points.</P>

<P>Sam Thibault '00 launched himself to a new PR in winning the Pole
Vault with a 14'1" clearance that gave him the top spot in NE3, and
essentially clinched the triple-win for MIT.</P>

<P>The 5000 squad took care of business, running with confidence and
aggressiveness, and came away with a sturdy 1-3-4 result.  McGuire,
the defending NE3 champion in this event, dispatched his challengers
and clocked a 4:47 last mile in a statement-making 15:16.7.  CC
co-captain Rich Rosalez '98, running in his final home meet, ran a PR
15:43.7 to take 3rd place, with freshmen Liyan Guo (4th, 15:57.2) and
Ed Keehr (5th, 16:00.8) stomping their old marks and their
opposition.</P>

<P>Freshman Nikos Michalakas '01 kept his collegiate record perfect
(2-0), by tossing the spear 176'3" for his second straight win.</P>

<P>The 4x400 Meter Relay team presaged some very good things with a
tough and competitive race.  Monty opened with a :51.6, shared a
clumsy handoff with Leif, whose :51.0 then surged MIT into the lead. 
Joel's :51.5 gave Neal a 12-meter lead.  Neal's :50.8 anchor was
ferocious, but Colby's NE3 Indoor 400 Champ had just enough to edge
him out by 0.2 seconds.  MIT's 3:24.8 clocking was their fastest in
recent memory, and all team members look forward to running much
faster later on. </P>

<P>The team's record is now 4-1 on the season.  Next Saturday, MIT
takes on some serious Division I competition at Northeastern
University in Dedham.  URI (2nd place in Indoor All-NE's).
UMass-Amherst, Dartmouth, Northeastern, and Bentley (Div. II) will
all be there, so high caliber competition will be the order of the
day.</P>
