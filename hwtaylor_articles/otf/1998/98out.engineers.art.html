<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For the first time ever, MIT lost the coveted Engineers' Cup in
Men's Track &amp; Field.  A strong RPI team came to town and ran
roughshod on the Beavers, taking a 96.5-77.5 win, with WPI a
"thanks-for-playing" third at 29.</P>

<P>MIT led through 10 events, and was still close (8 points) through
13, but when RPI went 1-2-3 in the 200 to open up a 17-point lead,
the "fat lady" began to sing.</P>

<P>The day was not without bright spots however.  Team co-captain
Ravi Sastry '98 was a double winner, scoring firsts in his
specialties, the Long Jump (21'7.5") and 110 Meter Hurdles (:15.70). 
He also contributed 3rd's in the 100 and High Jump, and led off the
second-place 4x100 Relay team.</P>

<P>Leif Seed '99 picked up two victories also, racing to a convincing
win in the 1500 (4:08.09), and coming back to win a tough battle in
the 400 Meter Hurdles (:58.05).</P>

<P>Distance stars Mike Parkins '99 and Chris McGuire '00 both won
their premier events, the 3000 Meter Steeplechase (9:41.1), and the
5000 Meters (15:34), respectively.  Both were New England Division
III champions in those events last May.  McGuire also placed second
in the 1500.</P>

<P>The other MIT wins came on clutch performances by freshmen.  John
Biesiadecki led the 800 Meters from wire to wire and scored his first
collegiate win (2:01.44).  Nick Michalakas, from Greece, threw the
Javelin 163'8" to pull out his first victory by one inch.</P>

<P>Of the non-winning performances, George Torres '99 probably had
the best day, qualifying for the New England Div. III Championships
in both the Hammer (150'1") and the Discus (137'6").</P>

<P>Next week, MIT is home for the last time this season against
Bates, Bowdoin, and Colby at 1:30.</P>
