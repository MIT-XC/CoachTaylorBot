    MIT Finishes Regular Season Undefeated
    
    
                  
    
    Horizontal Jumpers Have Career Day
    
    
                  
    
    April 11, 2015
    
    
                  
    
    Both Men's and Women's Outdoor Track & Field Teams braved the 40 degree, windy and cloudy day to dominate their competition in the Colby College Invitational, finishing the regular season undefeated. The women scored 287 points, more than doubling the score of their opponents; Bates College, Colby College, and Husson University. The men scored 218 points in defeating Bates, Colby, Husson and the University of Southern Maine.
    
    
                  
    
    The conditions were far from ideal, particularly the vicious wind gusts in the already cold temperatures, but the MIT athletes competed as if the conditions did not exist. For the jumpers, the conditions truly did not exist, as the conditions, which also included ice and snow in the horizontal jumping pits forced the jumpers inside. Arinze Okeke '17, further motivated at the opportunity to compete head to head against NCAA Champion, Jamie Ruginski, finished second to him in the Long Jump at 22-11 3/4, but then reversed the decision in the Triple Jump, taking the victory on his final jump, a 48-6 1/4 effort for the second best jump in MIT history. His long jump was the sixth best in MIT history.
    
    
                  
    
    Okeke was not the only record setter on this day. In the women's Long Jump, Veronica Szklarzewski '15 matched her indoor Long Jump record by taking first place honors while setting the MIT record at 18-2 3/4. Michelle Johnson '15, who easily had her best long jump ever with a second place 17-9 performance, took the Triple Jump victory, breaking her own MIT record with a leap of 37-10 1/2. Szklarzewski and Jocelyn Lorrey '18 added superb support with third and fourth place efforts of 36-2 3/4 and 35-8 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    The horizontal jumpers were not the only ones to find success for the Engineers. The women in fact won every field event. The pole vaulters, led by Cimmy Virdi '16 claimed the top four places. Maeve Devlin '18 placed second with 11-11 3/4, a mark that may make the NCAA field at the end of the season. Abby Klein '15 also cleared that height for third place. Jen Tylock '17 took fourth place at 11-5 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 led the group of vertical jumpers with her first place 5-5 performance, tying her outdoor varsity record. Natalie Alper '17 tied for third at 5-2 1/4 and Katherine Prutz '18 had a PR for sixth place, clearing 5-1 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    In the throwing events there was equal domination as the ladies spread the wealth. Tilly Taylor '15 was not challenged in the Javelin, winning with a throw of 127-6. Isabella Stuopis '16 took her favorite event, the Shot Put with a put of 41-4 1/4. Ashley Wheeler '15 set a personal best in the Hammer Throw with a mark of 165-5, leading her teammates to a 1-2-3-6 finish. Jackie Vahey '17 claimed the Discus at 125-1 while Ariela Slutsky and Stuopis took second and third.
    
    
                  
    
    The men did not dominate the field events as the women did, but they held their own and competed well. The only  victory other than Okeke's, was earned by Harry Rein '15, taking first place in the Javelin at 174-0. Ken Cooper '15 had exceptional competition but still took two seconds and one third, giving MIT 22 points in the 10-8-6-4-2-1 scoring format.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track the men took five victories. The most impressive was Allen Leung's 5K win. David Chelimo of Colby, a national level competitor, took the lead, trying numerous times to shake the competition, but Leung '15 and Cooper Sloan '18 would not let him go. Given the 25+mph winds the pace was impressive, hitting 1600, 3200 and 4800 marks of 4:56, 9:54 and 14:44. After a penultimate lap of 69, Chelimo still could not shake Leung, but he did break Sloan. With 200 to go, Leung dropped a 30 on his opponent, who could not respond to the challenge. Leung won in 15:14.34. Sloan did not fall too far behind, finishing in third in 15:19.64.
    
    
                  
    
    Tre Albritten '18 won the 200 in 21.98, leading teammates States Lee '16, Danny Newman '17 and Derek Barnes '16 to a 1-2-4-5 finish. Ben Freed '18 continued his winning ways in the 3000 Meter Steeplechase, winning a tactical, windy race in 9:58.53. Rick Paez '15 ran a come from behind victory over teammate Sam Parker '15 who had gone out in 54 seconds for the first quarter despite the high winds. Paez closed over 20 meters in the final 200 to win in 1:59.05 to Parker's 1:59.25.
    
    
                  
    
    The women won six of the 10 events they entered. Claiming four of those victories were Hannah Chen '18 and Maryann Gong '17. Chen took her specialties, the 100HH and 400IH, winning the 100HH in a personal collegiate best of 15.03 and the 400IH in 63.97. Gong led her teammates to a 1-2-3-4 sweep in the 1500 with her 4:57.55 victory. She returned later to even split a 2:20.56 800 win.
    
    
                  
    
    Szklarzewski had a hand in the other two first place efforts. She won the 100 in a personal best of 12.44 and led off the 4x100 Relay, made up of Annie Dai '18, Kendra Knittel '17 and Chen to a 51.52 victory. Knittel also ran a 26.11 second place personal best in the 200.
    
    
                  
    
    The day was a very successful one for Tech. With two weeks before the NEWMAC Conference Championship, the Engineers will split their squad into three meets in the upcoming week. Luke Gray '18 will attempt the Decathlon at the Holy Cross multi-meet on Wednesday and Thursday, a few distance runners will compete at Princeton Friday evening while many others will compete at MIT on Saturday in the Sean Collier Invitational.

    MIT Women Assault Top 10 List
    
    
                  
    
    Teams Prepare for Championships
    
    
                  
    
    April 18, 2015
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Women's team assaulted their Top 10 List at the Sean Collier Invitational with nine new or improved top 10 performances, one of them a new MIT record. The weather helped as the temperature was much improved from the two previous weekends, reaching a balmy 60 degrees. While the wind was also improved with a fairly constant  15 mph headwind blasting the runners on the homestretch in the oval events. The short sprints and jumps were able to change direction and go with the wind.
    
    
                  
    
    The Hammer Throw was the premier event and the final event of the day. With most of the MIT team there cheering, Ashley Wheeler '15 threw 169-1 3/4, to move within 16" of the MIT record. The performance also moves Wheeler to number 10 on the NCAA Division III Performance List. Ellen Wheeler '15, improved to 165-3 3/4, third on the MIT list and 19th on the NCAA list. Jackie Vahey '17 improved her best to 158-2, but did not move up from fifth on the MIT list. The trio placed 1-2-3 in the event.
    
    
                  
    
    Veronica Szklarzewski '15 continued her remarkable season. She added a quarter inch to her MIT record in the Long Jump, improving to 18-2 1/2. Earlier she had placed second in the 100 in 12.53 and led off the victorious 4x100 relay (49.12). She finished her day by running a new personal best of 26.33 in the 200 to move to number eight on the MIT list. Kendra Knittel '17 improved her 200 to 25.96 to slide up to fifth on the MIT list. Earlier she had not only run on the 4x100 Relay, but had earned the sixth best 100 time on the MIT list with a 12.61 performance.
    
    
                  
    
    While the Hammer Throw was the best for improved performances, the Pole Vault was the most dominant, claiming the top five places. Cimmy Virdi '16 took first with a new season best of 13-1 1/2, number two in NCAA Division III, but Abby Klein 'G jumped a new PR of 12-1 1/2 to take second place, move up to number five on the MIT list and number 12 on the NCAA performance list. 
    
    
                  
    
    The other Top 10 performance was turned in by Ariela Slutsky '18 in the Shot Put. From a power position the freshman threw 37-8 to move up to number 10 on the MIT list. Isabella Stuopis '16 threw a season best of 43-3 to win the event.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor threw a season best 138-7 1/4 to win the Javelin and move to 13th on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    A big breakthrough on the track came in the 800 Meter Race as the Engineers took 1-2-3-5 with four freshmen. Niki Waghani '18 ran a season best in winning the 800 in 2:21.70. Liz Cox '18 took second in 2:23.33, Lauren Paul '18 was third in 2:23.89 and Clementine Mitchell '18 placed fifth in 2:25.17.
    
    
                  
    
    The surprise performance of the meet was turned in by Jason Villanueva '18 in the Triple Jump. He had a monstrous PR of 46-3 1/2 to lead the jumpers to a 2-3-4 finish. A close second with regard to improved performances was that of Sam Ravnaas '18 who placed third in the Pole Vault with a huge personal best of 14-7 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Michael Kaba '16 had a big day on the track, running a season best 14.94 to win the high hurdles. Kaba also anchored the winning 4x100 Relay team of Tre Albritten '18, Luca Cacopardo '18 and States Lee '16 to a 42.58 season best. At the end of the day he ran the 200 for the first time this season, winning the 200 from his three relay mates with a 22.14.
    
    
                  
    
    With a gaping hole in the 1500 provided when Nick O'Connell '18 came down with mono and Colin Godwin '17 had to end his season with a stress reaction, the 800 group and distance runners stepped up to provide some support for the upcoming championships. Rick Paez '15 ran 4:03.48 for a new personal best and Allen Leung '15 won his section in 4:06.10. Both Paez and Leung finished strong with their final 300 in 48 seconds. 
    
    
                  
    
    The 800 runners also came through with an impressive 4x400 Relay victory. Henry Tareque '17 led off with a 51.6, Michael Picchini '18, finishing a 1500, 800, 4x400 triple, split 53.0, Paez doing the same triple ran 51.4 and Dan Kilcoyne '16 closed the deal with a 51.4 for a 3:27.49 cumulative time.
    
    
                  
    
    Despite the strong headwind at the finish of the 400, Derek Barnes '16 ran 49.89 to win that event. The other winner for Tech was Ben Freed '18 in the Steeplechase as the freshman waited until three laps to go to pull ahead and win easily in 9:51.89.
    
    
                  
    
    Next Saturday MIT plays host to the NEWMAC Conference Championship. With so many individuals on the men's side ending their season due to illness or injury the Engineers lack depth in many areas and will depend on quality to win their 15th consecutive conference title as a strong WPI team tries to use their depth across the board to wrestle the title away. The women, also lacking depth in the running events, will depend on their dominance in the field events to take their seventh straight NEWMAC title.

    Women Win ECAC DIII Championship
    
    
                  
    
    Motley Soars to Triple Jump Best
    
    
                  
    
    May 14-15, 2015
    
    
                  
    
    Even though MIT left all middle-distance and distance runners home to rest for the NCAA Division III Championship next week, they still managed to win the ECAC Division III Championship held at Springfield College on Thursday and Friday. On the strength of their field event athletes the Engineers scored 64 points, 4.5 points more than runner-up Ithaca College. The men, also leaving top distance runners behind, as well as Arinze Okeke out of the horizontal jumps, finished fourth with 41 points, well behind first place Brockport State's 72 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The top performance for Tech came when Carrington Motley '16 blasted a personal best 48-7 1/4 in the Triple Jump to place third and move up to 7th on the NCAA Division III ranking list.
    
    
                  
    
    The only winning performance for the men was earned by States Lee '16, the eighth seed in the 400. Lee ran a remarkable final 200 in lane one, walking down the entire field to cross the line in 48.21, a season best.
    
    
                  
    
    Ken Cooper '15, unable to throw the Hammer on Thursday due to an academic conflict, made his Discus count, placing second with a season best 163-1. That mark moves Cooper to 20th on the NCAA list, with the top 20 making the field at midnight tonight.
    
    
                  
    
    Ben Freed '18 went for a better NCAA mark in the 3000 Steeplechase, but fell short, placing third in 9:25.82. Freed could still make the NCAA field if eight individuals decide to not run due to injury or in favor of other events.
    
    
                  
    
    Both relays for the men, the 4x100 and 4x400 placed fifth. On Thursday, States Lee, Danny Newman '17, Derek Barnes '16 and Michael Kaba '16 tried to improve on their 3:15.37 run last week. Lee opened up with a 48.4 and a slight lead. Newman held the lead with a 49.4 leg, handing off to Barnes still with a slight lead. Barnes ran a great leg, handing the baton to Kaba slightly behind in 48.9. Kaba tried to move into the lead on the backstraight but was held off. He forced his way ahead, cutting off the Brockport State runner, causing both of them to stumble a step. By the time Kaba got to the homestretch he was out of gas, partly from his first 200 effort and part from being bedridden the week before. His 50.8 gave the team a 3:17.72, missing the NCAA Championship for the first time in six consecutive seasons. The 4x100 quartet of Tre Albritten '18, Luca Cacopardo '18, Lee and Kaba, with a best of 42.04, was hoping to get to the mid-41's by stretching the exchange zones. The handoffs were near perfect and fairly deep in the zones, but for some reason the unit only ran 42.26.
    
    
                  
    
    The final points earned by MIT were brought in by Sam Parker '15 in the 800. Parker was in the second fastest section so he knew he would need to run fast if he was going to make the NCAA field. He hit the first quarter in 54.9 and began to move to towards the front. At the 600 mark he came up on the shoulder of the leader, but stalled there. In the final 100 he tried to move for the win but was not able to. He finished in 1:53.31, a season best and sixth place overall.
    
    
                  
    
    The women had two victories supporting their team win. Cimmy Virdi '16, who was voted the outstanding female athlete of the meet, won the Pole Vault at 13-7 1/4. She entered at 13-2 3/4 after everyone else in the field was already out of the competition. Her attempts at 14-1 were really strong but not quite successful. Joanna Chen '15 added an eighth place and PR at 11-8 1/2. Three other MIT vaulters cleared 11-8 1/2 although they did not score; Abby Klein 'G, Maeve Devlin '18 and Jen Tylock '17.
    
    
                  
    
    The other victory was owned by Ashley Wheeler '15 in the Hammer Throw. Wheeler was consistent in the 170's, winning with a throw of 172-6. Ellen Liverpool '15 also scored in the Hammer, placing seventh with a throw of 159-5.
    
    
                  
    
    The one second place was supplied by Hannah Chen '18 who once again broke her own freshman record in the 400IH as she ran 61.03, remaining at number three on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Third place finishes were earned in the throws by Tilly Taylor '15 in the Javelin at 146-1 and Jackie Vahey '17 in the Discus at 138-1, both efforts were the second best performances this season respectively. Taylor is ranked sixth on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers placed fourth in three events. Kendra Knittel '17 ran an outstanding 200 in a personal best 25.17, placing fourth overall. Knittel was also a key leg in the 4x100 Relay that placed fourth. Veronica Szklarzewski '15 led off with an outstanding leg, handing off to Nneoma Okonkwo '18. Okonkwo seemed cautious as she did not gain any ground, but her handoff to Knittel was excellent. Knittel put 10 meters on the field, handing off to Chen in first. Chen added another five meters on the field to claim first in their section, but fourth overall in a season best 48.06. Szklarzewski also earned an individual fourth place, taking the honors in the Long Jump by going 18-0 1/2. She remains number 10 on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 placed fifth in the High Jump at 5' 5", but was over 5' 7" on her final attempt, just knocking it off with her heel.
    
    
                  
    
    Isabella Stuopis '16 brought in the final points by placing sixth in the Shot Put. She is sitting at 23rd on the National Shot Put list, hoping someone does not enter since the top 22 women per event make the NCAA championship field.
    
    
                  
    
    Those who qualify will leave on Tuesday for St. Lawrence University in Canton, NY. The NCAA Championships begin on Thursday and continue through Saturday.

    Tech Remains Undefeated - Compete Well Despite Cold and 30-50 mph Winds
    
    
                  
    
    April 4, 2015
    
    
                  
    
    The winter continues in Cambridge as the Engineers hosted the annual Engineers' Cup, minus WPI, braving temperatures in the upper 40's and a wind that was around 30 mph at the start of the meet and built throughout the meet to gusts of 50 mph. 
    
    
                  
    
    Throughout the meet, MIT Track & Field athletes focused on competing rather than worrying about times, distances or heights, so even though many of MIT's best athletes were held out or moved to the non-scoring 10K, Tech remained undefeated by taking down Rensselaer 107 to 86 and the women winning 141.5 to 53.5.
    
    
                  
    
    The women won every event except for the 5K and 3000 Steeplechase, an event in which they did not enter anyone. With only four scoring places per event, the top places were even more important. In nine of the events MIT took three of the top four places, with complete sweeps in both the Hammer Throw and the 800. 
    
    
                  
    
    Veronica Szklarzewski '15 led the team in scoring, winning the Long Jump at 16-11 1/4 and the 100 in 13.33. She also took second in the 200 and ran the leadoff leg in the victorious 4x100 Relay. 
    
    
                  
    
    Maryann Gong '17, Hannah Chen '18 and Kendra Knittel '17 also won two events. Gong took the 1500 in 4:49.69 (running the third 400 in 72 and the final 300 in 56 despite the extremely windy conditions) and the 800 in 2:27.68. She also added the winning anchor leg to the 4x400 Relay. Chen won the 100HH in 15.75 and the 400IH in 66.10, as well as anchoring the 4x100 to victory. Knittel took the 400 and 200 in 61.94 and 26.31 respectively. The 200 moves her to a tie for sixth all-time at MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    Other winners were Cimmy Virdi '16 in the Pole Vault (12-5 1/2), Ellen Liverpool '15 in the Hammer Throw (157-7 1/2), Michelle Johnson '15 in the Triple Jump (35-10), Isabella Stuopis '16 in the Shot Put (42-4), Ariela Slutsky '18 with a new PR in the Discus (128-1 1/4), Natalie Alper '17 with the second best jump in MIT history in the High Jump (5-4 1/2) and Tilly Taylor '15 in the Javelin (132-4 3/4).
    
    
                  
    
    Of particular note even though she did not win the event, Jackie Vahey '17 threw the hammer 157-03 3/4 for a big personal best.
    
    
                  
    
    Although the 10K was not a scoring event, Elaine McVay '15 cruised to a 37:48.96 victory despite the incredibly windy conditions.
    
    
                  
    
    The men held out Tre Albritten '18, Chris Sweeney '18, Colin Godwin '17, Rory Beyer '17, Karl Baranov '17 and Angel Echevarria '16, and ran all the top distance runners in the non-scoring 10K. Despite these losses and leaving the 5K void of entries, Tech won seven of the eight field events and every running event entered except the 1500 and 4x100 Relay.
    
    
                  
    
    The most dominant team performances were in the Long Jump and the 100 where MIT took the top three places. Ken Cooper '15 was the top scorer for the Engineer's from Cambridge, winning the Shot Put (46-5 1/2) and Hammer Throw (173-1 1/2) as well as earning second in the Discus (151-10 1/4). Also taking two victories was States Lee '16, who won the 100 (10.89 - tied for sixth all-time at MIT) and 200 (22.19).
    
    
                  
    
    Other winners for MIT were Arinze Okeke '17 in the Long Jump (22-3), Carrington Motley '16 in the Triple Jump (43-7 1/4), Sam Ravnaas '18 in the Pole Vault (13-7 1/2), John Thomas '15 in the High Jump (6-0), Harry Rein '15 in the Javelin (181-3 3/4), Derek Barnes '16 in the 400 (51.39), Michael Kaba '16 in the 110HH (15.99), Luca Cacopardo '18 in the 400IH (56.72), Rick Paez '15 in the 800 (2:00.93), Ben Freed '18 in the 3000 Steeplechase (9:54.17) and the 4x400 Relay (Cacopardo, Sam Parker '15, Henry Tareque '17 and Barnes).
    
    
                  
    
    The non-scoring 10K had MIT taking all five places; Matt Deyo '16 (32:22.73), Allen Leung '15 (32:33.19), Cooper Sloan '18 (33:00.94), Alex Knoedler '18 (33:04.99) and Nicholas Waltman '18 (33:58.05).
    
    
                  
    
    Next week MIT travels north to Waterville, Maine for a quadrangular meet with Bates, Colby and the University of Southern Maine.

    Gong and Zeinstra Run National 5K Performances
    
    
                  
    
    April 17, 2015
    
    
                  
    
    MIT took four individuals down to Princeton University to race in the Friday night distance festival at the Larry Ellis Invitational.
    
    
                  
    
    The only male runner, Sam Parker '15 ran the 800. His section was very competitive and with a 55 second first 400 he was in the middle of the pack. He missed an opportunity to move with 300 to go, but still ran his best race of the season as he finished in 1:53.52.
    
    
                  
    
    The 5K women did not toe the line until 9:15, but by this time the sky had cleared nicely and the temperature was an excellent 60 degrees. With numerous sub 16 minute runners in the field, the pace started out fast. Maryann Gong '17 and Nicole Zeinstra '16 resisted the urge to go out too fast, but still hit 77 and 79 second quarters respectively to open the race. Gong, running her first 5K since last year's outdoor NCAA Division III Championship, was cautious, slowing after an initial first 1600 of 5:17. Her subsequent 1600 splits were 5:26 and 5:34 before finishing with a 38 final 200 for a 16:55.27 performance. Zeinstra, just getting her legs back after being sick for a couple of weeks, ran a solid race, splitting 1600's in 5:20, 5:31 and 5:38 and then also finishing with a 38 for a 17:07.98 in what appeared to be an easy effort.
    
    
                  
    
    The final competitor for MIT, Elaine McVay '15, was in the final race, the 10K. With only six runners and none of them very fast it was difficult for McVay to get into a rhythm. On top of that, her back continued to give her problems, seizing up after 2000 meters. She stuck it out, but was only able to manage a 36:52.94 performance.
    
    
                  
    
    Next Saturday MIT plays host to the NEWMAC Conference Championship. With so many individuals on the men's side ending their season due to illness or injury the Engineers lack depth in many areas and will depend on quality to win their 15th consecutive conference title as a strong WPI team tries to use their depth across the board to wrestle the title away. The women, also lacking depth in the running events, will depend on their dominance in the field events to take their seventh straight NEWMAC title.

    Virdi and Gong Lead MIT Women to 5th Place
    
    
                  
    
    MIT Takes USTFCCCA Deb Vercauteren Program of the Year Award

    The MIT Women needed to finish among the top eight teams at the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field Championship to clinch the Deb Vercauteren Program of the Year Award. The Award honors the program with the highest total finishes at Cross Country, Indoor Track & Field and Outdoor Track & Field NCAA Championships. The program is awarded the same number of points as the team finish. After finishing second at Cross Country nationals and a tie for fourth at the Indoor Track & Field Championship, a total of 14 or fewer points would put MIT ahead of UW Lacrosse if they won Outdoor Nationals since they were 13th at Cross Country Championships and won Indoor. MIT's fifth place finish gave them a total of 11 points and the Program of the Year. The last time they won the award was 2010.
    
    
                  
    
    At the Awards Banquet the night before the start of the meet, MIT came away with six awards. Carrington Motley '16 earned the Elite 89 Award for men, an award given to the student-athlete at the championship with the highest GPA on a 4.0 scale. If there is a tie it goes to the one with the most units. Last year Motley lost the tie, but this year his perfect GPA won out. Cimmy Virdi '16 was voted the New England Region Female Field Athlete of the Year. Maryann Gong '17 was vote the New England Region Female Track Athlete of the Year. Coach Nick Davis was voted the New England Region Men's Assistant Coach of the Year. Coach Todd Linder was voted the New England Region Women's Assistant Coach of the Year and Coach Taylor was voted the New England Men's Head Coach of the Year.
    
    
                  
    
    Virdi, the top seed in the Pole Vault, did exactly what she was expected to do. Passing the first seven heights and coming in at 12-11 1/2 with only one other vaulter still in the competition. She cleared on the first attempt while Marissa Kalsey from Westminster College cleared on the third attempt. At 13-3 1/2, Virdi again cleared on the first attempt, and again Kalsey cleared on the third attempt with an assist from the official who was very generous with all wind aided bar displacements due to poles knocking the bar off. At 13-7 1/2, Kalsey missed all three attempts and Virdi, who had already won on misses, cleared to put an exclamation point on her victory. She then attempted to break her own NCAA Division III record of 4.27 meters by going for 4.32 meters, or 14-2. She moved up poles after crushing her pole on the first attempt, but the flex was too stiff, making the change of poles too much to adapt to.  Abby Klein 'G, clearing 11-3, 11-9 3/4 and 12-1 1/2 on third attempts, was over 12-3 1/2 on her third attempt, but after leaving the pit, the shaking bar was displaced, disallowing the make.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500 and 400IH trials, Maryann Gong '17 and Hannah Chen '18 advanced to Saturday's finals. Gong, despite having a rather severe cold, managed to escape the very strategic trials, winning her heat in 4:36.87, closing the final 300 in 50 seconds despite being tripped coming out of the final turn and almost doing a face-plant. Chen battled a strong wind on the back-stretch and lane two to advance with a 61.54 second place finish, the fifth fastest time in the trials.
    
    
                  
    
    Veronica Szklarzewski '15, seeded 10th in her first NCAA Division III Championship as an individual competitor (All America in 4x100 in 2014), was flat on her takeoffs, managing a 17-6 effort, not enough to make the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Elaine McVay '15, seeded 12th entering the 10K, ran a superb race. The initial pace was pedestrian at best as the first 400 was 1:30, but picked up nicely from there. McVay, who started near the back of the pack, continued to slide up in the pack and ready for the break-away as she hit 1600 splits of 5:45, 5:43, 5:48 and 5:50, before she took the lead with a 85 second quarter. She soon felt this was a mistake and she backed off to an 89, dropping far back in the pack. McVay's spurt started the break-away of four runners and she was not with them. She was in sixth, moved around after one lap and set off after the fourth place runner, who was falling back. Her fifth 1600 was 5:49 as she went after fourth. She passed her and went for third as her last 1600 was a 5:43. She was not able to make up the final distance, but still closed in a 82 to claim fourth in 36:00.69. Nicole Zeinstra '16 got gapped early in the race, tried to make up the gap, but lost focus and fell back. She finished 16th in 37:17.96 after entering as the 17th seed.
    
    
                  
    
    The men, represented by only four athletes, were hoping to gain All America honors for each competitor. While Ken Cooper '15 missed finals in the Discus by mere inches on a 51 meter sector foul, the event in which he is seeded to score is the Hammer Throw.
    
    
                  
    
    Matt Deyo '16 did his job. Seeded 18th in the 10k field, the junior (sophomore eligibility) finished fourth in an absolutely superb race. The initial pace was mind numbing as it became clear no one wanted to put the target on their back under the windy conditions. After 3200 meters of 5:20 and 5:13 pace, things finally started to roll. A 4:53 was followed by a 4:51 and then things really started to roll. Deyo at times appeared to just be holding on as a breakaway of three was followed by six more with Deyo looking pretty uncomfortable as his group ran a 4:46. Deyo moved into fourth, but was unable to maintain the pace and was passed back. This was the best thing that could have happened because the rest of the group that had been dropped, was coming back. The back and forth of Deyo and Morrison of North Central kept them at 72-73 pace. In the final 400 Deyo again moved into fourth, but everyone was kicking, making it obvious Deyo could end up anywhere from fourth to seventh. Hammering out a 66 final lap kept the others at bay, one was less than .4 behind. His final time was 30:59.58.
    
    
                  
    
    Ken Cooper '15 started things off on Friday, which for the most part was a day off for the MIT team. The Hammer Throw for men and then women was all the Engineers were entered in. Seeded seventh, Cooper had high hopes of getting All America honors. In the trials, Cooper was near the back after the first two rounds. On his final throw in the trials he threw 58.83 meters to finish third in his flight. After the final flight he was in fifth entering the finals. In the finals Cooper threw 59.43 (195') for a personal best to move into fourth place. This was temporary as he was passed by one person, bringing his All America dream to fruition, finishing in fifth place.
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's Hammer Throw was represented by two throwers, Ashley Wheeler '15 came in ranked ninth and Jackie Vahey '17 was seeded 22nd. For both women it was their first time at Nationals. Vahey was in the first flight and threw 158-2. Wheeler started with a 169-0 throw, but could not improve on that throw, missing finals by one person.
    
    
                  
    
    Saturday began with Arinze Okeke '17 and Motley in the Triple Jump. Both competed well. Okeke jumped 47-8 in the first flight and Motley 47-3. Going into the final round of the final flight, they were still ranked fifth and seventh respectively. However, after the final round they were ranked eighth and 11th. Okeke did not improve in the finals and got passed by the ninth jumper to finish in ninth, one place out of All America honors.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up was Gong in the 1500 final. Still a little sick, but feeling better than she did on Thursday, the sophomore was very nervous about her condition. The initial pace was pretty slow at 73 for the 400 and 2:27 for the 800. Tricia Serres '16 of Luther College took off and only Gong went with her. The third quarter was a 68 and with 300 meters to go, Gong began to fall off. Her sickness had taken away some of her strength, but she kept fighting. Her final 300 was in 52 seconds, but she was passed by two more to finish in fourth overall in 4:28.58, just shy of her personal record. MIT now had 20 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Chen was next for MIT in the 400IH finals. The freshman was in lane eight on the nine lane track. She started well and although her steps were a little off, she maintained pretty good momentum throughout the race. In the final straight she was able to finish strong to run 61.15 and finish fourth to give MIT five more points.
    
    
                  
    
    Michelle Johnson '15, seeded 19th in the Triple Jump, did her best, jumping 38-4 3/4 to miss finals by 12 centimeters and her PR by five centimeters. Johnson's jump was good for 14th place overall.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's Javelin was up and Tilly Taylor '15 was hoping to add to her team's score. Seeded sixth, going into the final throw it was not looking as though she would make finals. Taylor gathered strength from her cheering teammates and threw 143-5 to move into eighth place and make the finals. She was not able to move up, but did not get passed. Her eighth place was good for one point.
    
    
                  
    
    Gong and Zeinstra started the 5K just as the Javelin finals were getting underway. With most of the participants having already raced either the 10K or 1500, no one wanted to push the pace. The first 1600 was 5:54, but it gradually picked up as the second 1600 was 5:25. Things then got interesting as the leaders pushed the pace and the pack split up. The final 1600 for Gong was 5:16 as she fought to stay with the leaders. In the final 400 she was dropped but managed to hold onto third in 17:11.90. Zeinstra fell off in the final 1600, but held on for 13th place in 17:39.70, well ahead of her 16th seed going into the race.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's final tally was 32 points for fifth place while the men totaled nine points for 27th place.

    MIT Sweeps New England Division III Championships
    
    
                  
    
    Women Claim Nine Individual Victories - Virdi Sets National Record
    
    
                  
    
    April 30 - May 2, 2015
    
    
                  
    
    It appeared the MIT Men's and Women's Track & Field teams had won the New England Division III (NED3) Championships, being hosted by the Engineers in Cambridge, MA, before the meet had ever begun. With the women having won three of the past four years, the men two of the last three, and both being defending champions, last week's powerful victory over their NEWMAC rivals convinced their NED3 opponents that they did not have a chance to upset MIT, particularly at home. MIT owned the meet, the outcome and the atmosphere as it was obvious no other team had the same enthusiasm in support of their teammates. When the dust settled and the implements and spikes were put away, the men had defended their title with 172.5 points, 97.5 points more than the next closest team, Bates. The women claimed their third consecutive title, scoring 180 points, 91 more than second place Williams.
    
    
                  
    
    The women dominated their opponents by not only claiming nine individual victories, but also claiming at least two of the eight places in seven events, and four in the 10K. Not having anyone entered in the Heptathlon or the Steeplechase, the Engineers scored in all but two of the remaining events, demonstrating team balance and overwhelming strength.
    
    
                  
    
    Maryann Gong '17 was the only Engineer with two victories, taking individual titles in both the 1500 and the 5K. Having the first good weather day this spring, Gong took advantage of the 60 degree, sunny day with little wind and took the lead right at the gun. Going out a little too fast at the 200 (34), she backed off a bit to hit quarter splits in 70, 2:21 and 3:33. The first 200 had it's effect as she slowed a little to a 55 second final 300 for a 4:28.43 wire to wire victory. She is now second on the NCAA 1500 list. She also raced in the 5K, more to get some quality work in and to work on a relaxed kick. With the pace pretty slow through 1600 splits of 5:46 and 5:53, Gong dropped the hammer with 800 to go to win going away in 17:36.40.
    
    
                  
    
    The performance of the meet was far and away owned by Cimmy Virdi '16. The two-time indoor national champion put an exclamation mark on the record books, not only setting the MIT, facility and meet records, but also taking the NCAA Division III record with her vault of 14'. The junior, who came in at 3.77 meters, missed once at 3.97, 4.17 and 4.27. On her final attempt at 4.32 meters, despite the miss, she had what it took to make the vault, indicating she has not finished her assault on her competition or the records books.
    
    
                  
    
    The women set three more varsity records, all in the field events, and all improvements on their own records. Tilly Taylor '15 won the Javelin in convincing fashion, throwing 151-9 1/4 on her first throw in the finals to move to number five on the NCAA list. Ashley Wheeler '15 took the Hammer Throw with a throw of 175-9 1/4, having four throws over 50 meters. Wheeler is now eighth on the NCAA ranking. Michelle Johnson '15 added to her record with a second place in the Triple Jump at 38-6 3/4, one centimeter out of first place. The mark put her 13th on the NCAA list. Johnson also placed eighth in the Long Jump.
    
    
                  
    
    Isabella Stuopis '16 added to the field event victories with a PR in the Shot Put of 43-9 3/4. The junior claimed the victory and personal best on her final throw, showing the competitor she is. Completing the sweep of victories in the throwing events, Jackie Vahey '17 took the Discus Throw by one centimeter, throwing 136-7 3/4 on her second throw in finals. Vahey also placed sixth in the Hammer.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers earned two more victories on the track. Hannah Chen '18 ran a nearly perfect race in the 400IH, only stuttering the final hurdle as she accelerated coming off the ninth hurdle, breaking her rhythm, but maintaining the victory with a personal best 61.45 for third on the NCAA list and a new MIT freshman record. Chen also placed fifth in the 100HH and anchored both the 4x100 (Szklarzewski '15, Okonkwo '18, Knittel '17) and 4x400 (Dai '18, Knittel '17, Harris '15) relays to second and third place finishes respectively. On the first night, perfect temperatures set the stage for Elaine McVay '15 to not only win the 10K, but run an amazing 36:01.36 to move to 11th on the NCAA list. McVay, despite still suffering from back spasms, persevered, lapping most of the field as she won by 59 seconds.
    
    
                  
    
    Kendra Knittel  had a fantastic day, running the 100, 200 and both the 4x100 and 4x400 relays. Knittel had the fastest time in the 100 trials, running 12.40 after not being seeded to make the final. In the final she ran a 12.36 to place third. In the 200 she ran a best of 25.36 for fourth place.
    
    
                  
    
    Veronica Szklarzewski, perhaps a little fatigued from her amazing NEWMAC Championship one week ago, still managed a sixth in the 100 in 12.49, a seventh in the Long Jump at 17-4 1/4 as well as running an excellent leadoff leg in the 4x100.
    
    
                  
    
    Mary Eccles '18 completed an excellent freshman year by scoring in the 10K and 5K on successive days, setting personal bests in both. In the 10K, the freshman was patient with the slow early pace of her group, hitting 1600 splits of 6:03, 6:06, 6:07 and 6:03, before taking the initiative and running 88-89 second pace the remainder of the way to finish fourth in 37:32.10. The next day in the 5K, Eccles handled the faster pace to PR in 17:59.99 and place fifth.
    
    
                  
    
    The men earned four individual victories, as well as seven second place finishes and numerous other high finishes to pull away from the competition early on the second day of competition. Missing a possible four individual champions due to injury, all of who will return for another season or more, Tech was uncertain going into the season if everyone could step up enough to make up for the loss of so much top talent. They needn't have worried.
    
    
                  
    
    The distance runners came through in a big way, claiming 41 points in just the 5K and 10K. In the 10K on the first night, Matt Deyo '16 and Allen Leung '15 took off at the beginning, hoping to take advantage of the excellent weather conditions. For the first three miles or so, as they went through 1600 splits of 5:01, 5:00, and 5:00, the pair swapped off taking the lead. Towards the end of the fourth mile, they decided to start pushing the pace. The fourth 1600 was 4:56 and the fifth 4:52. Deyo pushed the pace even more in the final 800, hitting the sixth mile in 4:47 before closing in 66 seconds to win in 30:42.78. Leung held on very nicely, finishing second in 30:49.98. Freshmen Nicholas Waltman and Alex Knoedler had their own battle with three other runners, who were all vying for the final two scoring positions. Waltman and Knoedler tried to break the pack, but could only drop two of them. Waltman ended up eighth in 31:48.42 and Knoedler ninth in 31:58.37, a very impressive showing for the freshmen. The next day, Deyo and Leung, having the option to not race, decided to run and work on their kick while supporting teammate Cooper Sloan '18. Sloan took the pace out, but the chase pack led by Deyo and Leung caught him in the ninth lap. Leung opened up a 60 flat final 400 to win in 14:58.68. Deyo was second in 15:00.81 and Sloan third in 15:10.11. This was the only 1-2-3 sweep in the meet. Deyo and Leung are ranked 15th and 19th respectively on the NCAA 10K list.
    
    
                  
    
    States Lee '16 won the 400 in 48.30. He was a little disappointed in the time, but he knew he had gone out too hard in the opening 200. Earlier he had run an excellent third leg in the runner-up 4x100 team, comprised of Tre Albritten '18, Luca Cacopardo '18 and Michael Kaba '16, that ran 42.04. Later in the day, Lee ran a season best 21.95 in the 200 to place third, just .03 out of first. In the final event, Lee anchored the 4x400 relay of Kaba, Derek Barnes '16 and Danny Newman '17 with a 48.2 to place second in 3:16.78.
    
    
                  
    
    Kaba also was quite busy in this championship. On day one he had the fastest qualifying time in the 110HH with a 15.34. In the 100 trials, he had a very poor start and did not qualify for Saturday's final. After his excellent anchor leg in the 4x100, Kaba claimed the 110HH victory in 14.98. In the 400IH, he had unfortunately drawn lane one. The inside lane combined with his inability to get the proper rhythm in the 400IH caused him the stutter step early in race. Finishing hard, he came from behind to finish fourth in 54.52. His opening leg in the 4x400 was not up to his usual standards but was still a solid 49.8.
    
    
                  
    
    Ken Cooper '15 did not have a victory, but he scored 22 points for his team, the most of any MIT athlete, while going up against the top throwers in the country. Cooper earned  second place in both the Shot Put and Discus Throw with performances of 51-8 1/2 and 158-11 3/4. In the Hammer, Cooper placed third with a throw of 193-8, just short of his best, which at 193-9 is sixth on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Arinze Okeke '17 also placed in multiple events. On day one Okeke finished fifth at 22-0 1/4. The next day in the Triple Jump, Okeke led his teammates to a 3-4-5-6 finish for a big 18 points. Okeke jumped 47-4 1/4, Carrington Motley '16 47-0 1/4, Billy Ruschel '18 45-10 3/4 and Angel Ecchevarria 45-9 3/4. Okeke is 11th on the NCAA Triple Jump list.
    
    
                  
    
    Marshall Wentworth '16 showed his victory last week was no fluke as he finished second in the Pole Vault at 14-9. The junior had a nice attempt at 15-3 in a three way jump off, but did not quite clear. Sam Ravnaas completed his freshman year with a fifth place, also clearing 14-9.
    
    
                  
    
    Other personal bests were had by Ben Freed '18 in the Steeplechase, who placed third in 9:31.54, Luke Gray '18 who scored 5532 points to place seventh in the Decathlon, and the 4x800 team of Rick Paez '15, Henry Tareque '17, Michael Picchini '18 and Sam Parker '15 placed fourth in 7:50.92.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week MIT hosts their third championship in a row, the NEICAAA Championship, better known as the All Division New Englands. Giving many of their athletes the weekend off from competing, the Engineers will now focus on the NCAA Division III Championship in three weeks.

    Women Take Second - Defeat All DI Teams
    
    
                  
    
    Szklarzewski Sets LJ Record, Freed Sets Rookie Steeple Mark
    
    
                  
    
    May 7-9, 2015
    
    
                  
    
    Even though there was no intent to go for the team title, with the total focus on rest and preparing for the upcoming NCAA Division III Championship in two weeks, MIT's women's team came in second in the NEICAAA Championship with 68 points, four points out of first. This championship is one in which NCAA Division I, II, and III colleges throughout New England compete against each other. Only Division II Southern Connecticut State University was able to take down the Engineers, doing so in the final event. In the process, the women defeated at least 12 Division I teams and quite a few Division II Colleges. The men tied for eighth with 35 points resting even more individuals than the women.
    
    
                  
    
    For the women, once again the field events led the way, scoring 46 of their 68 points. Veronica Szklarzewski '15 got things started by going from the first flight of the Long Jump (not seeded to score), to placing second with an 18-10 bomb to move to eighth on the NCAA list. 
    
    
                  
    
    Cimmy Virdi '16 did what she does best in this sport, win the Pole Vault, doing so with a 13-1 1/2 vault. Abby Klein 'G supported the team with five points by placing fourth at 12-1 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    Ashley Wheeler '15 and Tilly Taylor '15 earned third place finishes on the first day of competition. Wheeler threw 173-10 in the Hammer and Taylor threw 135-6 in the Javelin. Ellen Liverpool '15 added an eighth place in the Hammer with a 163-0 performance.
    
    
                  
    
    On day two the points kept coming. Isabella Stuopis '16 threw 43-8 in the Shot Put to place third. Natalie Alper '17 tied the MIT record in the High Jump at 5-5, earning a three way tie for fifth place. Jackie Vahey '17 had a less than stellar meet, but threw far enough in the Discus to place eighth with a throw of 127-6. Michelle Johnson '15 took one jump in the Triple Jump, felt her leg tighten up a bit and decided to call it quits for the day. That one jump was 37-6 1/2, one place out of the scoring.
    
    
                  
    
    There were not a lot of entries in the running events for MIT, but what there was brought a strong return. Hannah Chen '18 broke her own freshman record in the trials of the 400IH, running 61.43. The next day she ran 61.49 to place second overall. Chen is on the verge of a breakthrough performance and has two weeks to make it happen.
    
    
                  
    
    Maryann Gong '17 decided to go with the top runner in the 1500, a runner who has a best that is 10 seconds faster than Gong's. To her credit, Gong did not know what she was capable of and wanted to take advantage of the perfect weather. With the team not concerned about scoring and already qualified for the NCAA Division III Championship there was nothing to lose. The pace was quick at 68 for the first quarter, but Gong looked comfortable. At 2:19 she looked fine, but seemed to doubt herself a bit. After 900 meters she backed off, perhaps prematurely, but continued to run another 73 for 3:32 at 1200 meters. At this point she died, but held on for a 4:28.56 second place finish. Realizing that dying in a race does not hurt as much as giving up may serve her well in the future. Later she came back in the 800 to run 2:15.45 but did not place.
    
    
                  
    
    Nicole Zeinstra '16 delivered the biggest improvement for the women. Running the 10K on the evening of the first day, Zeinstra was wanting to run over a minute than she did the previous week when she did not feel well. She knew she needed at least a low 36 minute performance to have a shot at Nationals and was concerned the pace would not be fast enough. Fortunately there was a pack of eight that went out in 87 pace, locking that in for 1600 splits of 5:48, 5:48, 5:50 and 5:50 through 6400 meters. At this point the pace picked up with only Zeinstra and Serrano of the University of New Hampshire making the break. The fifth metric mile was a 4:44, but then Zeinstra fell off the pace, again running 87's. A runner from Middlebury College caught up to her, and although Zeinstra ran an 81 final 400 she was not able to move into second. Her third place 36:06.76 is 16th on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    The men's point leader all year, and in this meet, was Ken Cooper '15. The senior began the competition with a personal best in the Hammer Throw, a mark of 194-10 for fifth place. This puts Cooper sixth on the NCAA ranking. On day two, Cooper did not perform his best, but threw well enough to again place fifth in the Discus at 149-10 and sixth in the Shot Put at 49-11.  All together Cooper scored 11 points for the Engineers.
    
    
                  
    
    States Lee '16 ran a season best 48.25 to place second in the 400 after running 48.76 in the trials the day before. He later led off the 4x400 relay with a 48.3 that ended up placing fourth. With Michael Kaba '16 out with an illness, Sam Parker '15 would be substituting in after his 800 race. Danny Newman '17 was already a rookie among the quartet that had two members different from their All America fourth place team in 2014. The other veteran on the team was Derek Barnes '16. After Lee's leadoff, Newman ran a very inspired 49.0 split to barely hold onto the lead. Barnes was next, and although he was passed immediately after the handoff, Barnes retook the lead on the backstretch and held onto it with a 48.9 split. Parker, who had run 1:53.44 earlier in the day, ran as well as he could, splitting 49.0 to finish fourth in a season best 3:15.37.
    
    
                  
    
    Luca Cacopardo '18 had run a season best 53.78 in the 400IH trials on day one of the competition. On day two, he was a little slower to the first hurdle and the backstretch. The slower pace served him well on the homestretch as he passed people. He did not switch legs when he should have, forcing him to reach on the final three hurdles, just as he had done in the trials. His 54.37 earned him a hard fought third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Ben Freed '18 had wanted to prove he could be more competitive than he had been the previous two weeks, so he was given the opportunity since this was a home meet and he had made the qualifying standard. His 9:31 Steeplchase performance was enough to get into the fast section. The pace was solid at 4:56 for the 1600 and there were a lot of runners in contention. The place slowed for one lap and then Freed went with the leaders as they resumed 74 pace. He finished strong, covering the final 200, which includes a barrier and the water jump, in 34 seconds. His final time of 9:16.04 earned him a sixth place and has him at 19th on the NCAA Division III list and the new owner of the MIT freshman record.
    
    
                  
    
    Arinze Okeke '17, who had not scored, or jumped well in the Long Jump (21-9), came back well in the Triple Jump to place seventh at 47-3 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week MIT will travel for the first time as a team since April 11. The ECAC Division III Meet will be hosted By Springfield College on Thursday and Friday, the final days to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship.

    MIT Dominates NEWMAC Championship
    
    
                  
    
    Men Win 15th Consecutive, Women Win 7th
    
    
                  
    
    April 25, 2015
    
    
                  
    
    Despite the unusually high frequency of injuries and illnesses to strike the Men's and Women's Track & Field teams this Spring, the remaining corp of healthy individuals did what many MIT Track & Field championship teams in the past have done--step up and get the job done. The men did so in convincing fashion despite being down by ~80 points due to injury, winning the NEWMAC Track & Field Championship at their home track, with a meet record 309 points to 212.5 for second place WPI. The women nearly doubled the score of the second place team, winning with 249 point to 125 for WPI.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's men's team, typically look past this meet to the upcoming championships, particularly the New England Division III Championship the following weekend. However, with their depleted team and the knowledge that WPI would be coming after them with the passion a team can bring when they are hungry to win a championship and can sense the weakness of their opponent, MIT knew they could not look past this meet.
    
    
                  
    
    With temperatures in the upper 50's, and winds generally about 15 mph, the Engineers focused on competing, not on performance. The results were the proof of their success. The men won 13 of 20 events and took another 12 second places in a meet where all teams were limited to only four entries per event.
    
    
                  
    
    Winning two of those events and setting a personal best in getting second in another, Ken Cooper '15 earned the NEWMAC Male Field Athlete of the Year. Losing by only 14", Cooper's hammer throw of 193-9 3/4 was a big personal best, putting him at sixth on the NCAA list. Cooper's victories were in the Shot Put and Discus.
    
    
                  
    
    Equally impressive on the track, Michael Kaba '16 competed in four events, winning or helping to win three of them while finishing second in another, also performing a big personal best. Kaba began his day anchoring the winning 4x100 Relay team, comprised of Tre Albritten '18, Luca Cacopardo '18 and States Lee '16, to a season best 42.35 victory. After successful trial heats in the 110HH and 100, the junior stepped up to a personal best 14.85 victory in the 110HH. Two events later he ran a wind-aided 10.82 second place in the 100, another personal best. Again, two events later, Kaba led a 1-2-3 sweep in the 400IH with a 54.49 first place time. For his efforts, Kaba was awarded the NEWMAC Male Track Athlete of the Year.
    
    
                  
    
    Sweeping the top three places occurred in three more events for Tech. The horizontal jumpers dominated the day, taking two of those three sweeps, doing so in the Long and Triple Jumps. In the Long Jump, Carrington Motley '16 got it done on his final jump, claiming victory with his 21-10 3/4 effort. Just behind him, Arinze Okeke '17 jumped 21-8 1/4 for second place. Billy Ruschel '18 took third at 21-2 3/4. The same individuals provided the same end results in the Triple Jump, but the order was not the same. Nearly fouling out, Ruschel came back to win the event with a personal best 46-11. Motley took second with 46-6 1/4 and Okeke third at 46-0 3/4. For his impressive performances, Ruschel was honored with the NEWMAC Male Rookie of the Year award.
    
    
                  
    
    The other 1-2-3 sweep was in the 5K. Already having won the 1500 in a PR of 3:57.79, but needing a 5K qualifying time for next week's championship, Matt Deyo '16 allowed teammates Allen Leung '15 and Cooper Sloan '18 to help pace him through 3600 before taking the pace himself to win in 15:06.44. Leung, having placed fifth in the 1500 earlier in 4:01.70, was second in 15:20.21 as he backed off once his job was done. Sloan also backed off, just making sure he maintained third place in 15:29.59.
    
    
                  
    
    The most impressive performance came in the Pole Vault. Marshall Wentworth '15 provided the ultimate "stepping up" moment when he went from his default mid-13' vault status, to first setting a personal best of 14-7 1/4 and then capping that off with a 14-11 clear for the victory. Sam Ravnaas '18 showed last week's improvement was no fluke as he took second place honors with 14-7 1/4. Joining in the mix, Jorge Gonzalez '18 jumped a collegiate best 14-1 1/4 to take fifth and Decathlete Luke Gray '18 cleared 13-1 1/2 for eighth.
    
    
                  
    
    Other victories were claimed by States Lee '16 in the 200 and Nicholas Waltman '18 in the 10K. Lee had a busy day, first as a member of the winning 4x100 Relay team, then trials and finals in the 100 Meter Dash where he finished third, tying his personal best of 10.88. Lee took the time to secure first place in the 200 with a time of 22.12 before leading off the victorious 4x400 Relay team with a 48.9 split. The other members of that winning 4x400 Relay team were Danny Newman '18 running second, Cacopardo running third and Derek Barnes '15 bringing home the victory with a 49.2 anchor for a 3:19.47 overall time. Waltman and Alex Knoedler '18 were the only entries for MIT in the 10K and knew with that being the first event of the meet they needed to do better than their first and sixth seeds. Fortunately the pace was solid as nearly the entire field went through the first four miles with splits of 5:13, 5:16, 5:17 and 5:21. At that point Waltman took over, throwing down a 73 quarter before settling in at 77 second pace, finishing in a solid 32:32.76 PR victory. Knoedler, unable to follow his teammate, had a nice battle with a Coast Guard runner for two miles of 78 second pace before losing in the final half lap, but holding on for a solid third in a PR of 32:45.76. 
    
    
                  
    
    All NEWMAC selections went to the top two finishers in each event. Other MIT athletes receiving that award were John Thomas '15 for his very well timed season best of 6-4 in the High Jump, earning second place, Cody Bratten '18 taking second place in the Discus with a throw of 134-4, Chris Sweeney '18 running a personal best of 15.33 to claim second in the 110HH, Luca Cacopardo '18, taking second place in the 400IH with a 54.66 performance, Sam Parker '15 running 1:55.55 to take second in the 800 and Ben Freed '18 running 9:35.17 in the 3000 Steeplechase for second place.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's meet was never in doubt, which led to a slightly lower level of expectation by the MIT women, particularly in the middle-distance events. Certainly the field event performers were extremely well focused going into the meet, and it only seemed more intense as the meet went on. Leading the charge was Jackie Vahey '17. Vahey won the Discus with a season best 138-3, took third in the Shot Put with a season best 37-9 1/2 and took second in the Hammer with a super personal best of 167-5 1/4, number 16 on the NCAA list. Vahey was awarded the NEWMAC Female Field Athlete of the Year for her performances.
    
    
                  
    
    Ashley Wheeler '15 and Michelle Johnson '15 both set MIT records in claiming victories in their respective events. Wheeler threw 174-3 1/4 in the Hammer Throw to move up to number seven on the NCAA list as she added five feet to her previous best. Similarly, Johnson added over a half foot to her previous Triple Jump best. On her final jump she produced a 38-5 1/2 record setting effort for the victory.
    
    
                  
    
    The only 1-2-3 sweeps earned by the Engineers were in the Hammer Throw and the Pole Vault. Joining Wheeler and Vahey, Ellen Liverpool '15 took third with a solid throw of 161-8. Additionally, Isabella Stuopis '16, who also won the Shot Put with a throw of 40-9 and placed sixth in the Javelin with a throw of 98-11 1/4, threw 134-6 for sixth place. Cimmy Virdi '16 remained undefeated this season, winning the vault at 13-1 1/2 and was followed by sophomore Jen Tylock's second place personal best vault of 11-9 3/4 and freshman Maeve Devlin's third place vault of 11-5 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor '15 threw her season best and second best throw ever in the Javelin Throw, winning the event with 141-8 3/4 to give MIT six wins in the eight field events.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Mary Eccles '18 got things going with the first event, the 10K. Seeded with no time since she had never before competed in a 10K, Eccles nevertheless was determined to win the event. Knowing she had a heavy competitive schedule the next weekend, Eccles did not want to go out and lead the race, but neither was she comfortable with the resulting pedestrian pace set by the leaders. After an initial lap at 1:42, the pace picked up marginally to 1:36 per lap. After 4800 meters of this Eccles took off with an 87 lap and no one went with her. She continued with 89-90 second place the rest of the way to win in 38:46.29.
    
    
                  
    
    Maryann Gong '17 won the 1500 in 4:34.06, easily her season best. She spent the first 900 meters in the pack because the pace was fast enough with splits of 72 and 2:26. Gong moved hard, running 3:38 and closing with a 56 final 300. 
    
    
                  
    
    Elaine McVay '15 trying to come back from a back injury, needed to qualify in the 5K for next week's championship. Nicole Zeinstra '16 and Anna Frederich '18 were in there to help with the pace and get in a solid effort. After a slow initial quarter, the trio dropped the pace to 84 and were rather erratic, the pace ranging from 83 to 86 until McVay closed it out with 80 second pace for the final 600 meters, winning in 17:38.18. Zeinstra backed off with 1000 meters to go, taking second in 17:41.11. Frederich, who had earlier taken seventh in the 1500 with a 4:50.42, finished in fourth with 18:30.30.
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen '18 started her day by leading Veronica Szklarzewski '15, Nneoma Okonkwo '18 and Kendra Knittel '17 to victory in the 4x100 Relay with a superb anchor leg and 48.87 performance. The trials and finals in the 100HH did not go as hoped, but still netted Chen a 15.60 fifth place finish. She came back to dominate her primary event, the 400IH, in 62.05 despite stuttering on hurdles six, seven and eight. Chen finished her day in anchoring the 4x400 Relay with a 58.6 for a season best 4:00.96 third place finish.
    
    
                  
    
    Other All Conference honors were won by Szklarzewski in the 100, running a PR of 12.35 for second place and Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 taking second place in the High Jump, clearing 5-4 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Next weekend MIT will host the New England Division III Championships. Both teams will be attempting to defend their titles from last year. The men's meet begins on Thursday with the decathlon, concluding on Saturday while the women begin competition on Friday.

    MIT Track & Field Teams Begin Season With Victories at Point Loma Nazarene University Invitational
    
    
                  
    
    March 28, 2015
    
    
                  
    
    MIT Track & Field made their annual trip West to enjoy the warmer climate afforded them by California, ending the week of intense training with the Point Loma Nazarene University Invitational in San Diego to open their season. Despite only bringing 16 men and 16 women on the trip, all technical athletes (field events, hurdlers, steeplechasers and 4x100 runners), the Engineers still managed to win both meets. The men won handedly, scoring 320 points to defeat the 11 other teams. The women scored 272.5 points to win by 3.9 points over the second place Cerritos team in the 13 team field.
    
    
                  
    
    Leading the way for the women were the throwers in general with three victories, Cimmy Virdi '16 winning the Pole Vault and Hannah Chen '18 winning the 400IH. Isabella Stuopis '16 took first place honors in the Shot Put with a heave of 40-7 3/4. Ellen Liverpool '15 won the Hammer Throw as she started the season with a personal best of 160-2. Jackie Vahey '17 started where she left off last year, throwing 135-5 for the victory in the Discus.
    
    
                  
    
    Virdi easily cleared 12-5 1/2 as her opening height after everyone else was out of the competition, but then lost focus at 12-11 1/2, even cutting her chin on the bar. Maeve Devlin '18 cleared 11-5 3/4 for second place.
    
    
                  
    
    Chen posted the fastest time in the country for Division III in the 400IH as she was victorious in 61.71 in her third race of the day, setting a new MIT freshman record. Earlier she anchored the 4x100 Relay made up of Veronica Szklarzewski '15, Kayla Harris '15, and Kendra Knittel '17 to a third place time of 48.81. She then came back in the 100HH. She looked excellent through seven hurdles as she was with the leaders. She hit the eighth hurdle pretty hard, managed the ninth hurdle then four stepped and hopped the 10th hurdle, finishing seventh in 15.58.
    
    
                  
    
    Szklarzewski had a good opening day, placing fourth in the 100 in 12.46 for a new PR. She also placed sixth in the Long Jump at 17-2, another personal best and sixth in the Triple Jump with yet another PR of 35-10 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    Nneoma Okonkwo '18, coming back from a stress reaction in her shins, wasted no time putting up some solid marks, jumping 17-8 3/4 in the Long Jump for second place and running 12.87 in the 100, placing 11th. 
    
    
                  
    
    The most dominating event for the women was the Hammer Throw. Supporting Liverpool's victory were a third place finish by Ashley Wheeler '15 with a throw of 145-9, a fifth place showing by Vahey with a throw of 144-7, a ninth place effort by Stuopis, throwing 131-6 and Ariela Slutsky '18 throwing 107-5 for 13th place.
    
    
                  
    
    Ken Cooper '15 certainly dominated for the men, coming away with three victories, taking the Hammer Throw in 185-10, the Discus Throw in 152-10 and the Shot Put in 52-8. 
    
    
                  
    
    Arinze Okeke '17 had quite the opening day as well. He won the Long Jump in a personal best 22-5 3/4 and then took first place in the Triple Jump in 47-9. The horizontal jumpers dominated as they have all season. Supporting Okeke was Carrington Motley '16, placing second in the Triple Jump at 45-9 1/4 and fourth in the Long Jump at 21-3 1/2. Billy Ruschel '18 took fourth in the Triple Jump at 44-1 1/2 and sixth in the Long Jump at 20-6 1/2. Jason Villanueva '18 was sixth in the Triple Jump at 43-8, and 12th in the Long Jump at 18-4 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    On the Track, States Lee '16 had a strong first meet. He first anchored the 4x100 made up of Tre Albritten '18, Okeke and Ruschel to a fine 42.96 fourth place finish. He then won the 400 in 48.37. A couple hours later he placed second in the 200 in 22.06 and then anchored the victorious 4x400 made up of Michael Kaba '16 (49.6), Luca Cacopardo '18 (50.2), Chris Sweeney '18 (50.5), in 48.1 for a cumulative time of 3:18.53.
    
    
                  
    
    Ben Freed '18 ran the fastest debut steeplechase ever for an MIT runner, taking second in 9:33.98. 
    
    
                  
    
    The most dominant event in the entire meet for MIT was the 400IH for the men. Fighting a pretty strong headwind on the backstretch, Kaba ran conservatively over the first six hurdles, allowing him to finish strong in 53.94 for the victory. Cacopardo '18 went out pretty hard in the first half of the race, struggling over the final two hurdles in a second place 54.15. Sweeney finished fourth in 55.36. Kaba also placed second in the 110HH in 15.07.

    Chen and Gong Compete at USATF Junior Nationals
    
    
                  
    
    June 25-28, 2015
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen '18 and Maryann Gong '17 both qualified for the USATF Junior Championship, which was held this weekend at the Mecca of Track and Field, Eugene, Oregon. Gong had qualified in the 1500, 3000 and 5000 meter races, while Chen qualified in the 400IH. Gong elected to only race the 3K due to the schedule and the fact she was primarily doing mileage in preparation the for the Fall.
    
    
                  
    
    Both had a long year of training and racing, but both wanted to have the opportunity to race one more time. Those placing among the top two in each event would represent the United States in the Pan Am Junior Championship later this summer.
    
    
                  
    
    The weather was pretty awful, especially for Eugene. Both days of competition for MIT were 99 degrees, sunny and humid. Whether it was the long season, the practices alone without a coach to help with the mental side of training and racing, the weather, or some combination of the above, the women did not compete well.
    
    
                  
    
    Chen was technically sound throughout most of the race in that she did not stutter, but was flat throughout the race. She overstrided on the first hurdle, decelerated as she landed off balance and floated her trail leg on the first four hurdles, but overall she just did not seem that competitive. However, she did place 12th out of 17 with a 62.24.
    
    
                  
    
    Gong, suffering a bit from allergies and not having particularly strong practices since March, seemed ready to compete mentally, but in reality she was never in the race. Figuring she could handle 76 second quarters throughout the race, she was fortunate in that the field ran the first quarter in 76. Then the pace slowed to 79 and then 80. Gong was at the back of the main pace, but seemed disengaged, and indeed fell off by a meter or two as the group slowed. At her worst, she could handle a 5:00 first mile, as long as she was racing. However, she had checked out mentally and fell off badly at the 1600, hitting 5:16. From there it was survival as she finished sixth in 10:05.48. Even though the performances were not up to par, the experience should serve both well in the future.
    
    
                  
    
    Both will take some time away from racing. Gong has to now focus on mileage as she prepares for the cross country season in the fall.
