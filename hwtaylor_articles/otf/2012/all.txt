    MATTOCKS, SERENE LEAD WAY WITH EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCES AT ECAC DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
                  
    
    May 17-18, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    The last opportunity for teams to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship ended on Friday. MIT traveled to the ECAC Division III Championship, hosted by RPI in Troy, NY. The weather was excellent with 70 degree plus temperatures both Thursday and Friday and cooler temperatures on Thursday evening for the distance races.
    
    
                  
    
    Leading the way for MIT on day one was Stephen Serene '12 in the 3000 Meter Steeplechase. Entering the event with a PR of 9:17, but knowing he had not yet raced a full race without giving up at some point, Serene was determined to not let this be his last race. With the meet falling 30 minutes behind schedule, the steeplers were anxious to get going. The initial pace was crisp, hitting the first 400 in 67. From that point on Serene stayed with the leaders through lap after lap of 74 second quarters. Serene fell back briefly in the fifth lap, looking as though he might fall back to his old habits, but he instead caught back up and tried to win. In a very high quality field, his final 200 in 34 was only enough for third place, but his 9:04.32 was a huge MIT record and put him 12th on the phenomenal NCAA list where it will take a sub 9:09 to make it into the NCAA Championship field.
    
    
                  
    
    Also running an NCAA Division III qualifying time was the women's 4x400 Relay team of Jamie Simmons '12, Martha Gross '12, Jackie Brew '14 and Portia Jones '12. Going into the meet the team had not run together due to the injury to Brew, so their 3:58 only qualified them to race in the second of three sections. In order to race 3:50, which was probably what it would take to go to the NCAA Division III Championship, the quartet would have to do it without competition. Simmons led off with her typical outstanding 55.9 split to put the Engineers far into the lead. Gross took the baton, went out hard, but strained to much, trying to run fast rather than letting it happen. On the final 100 she locked up, barely making it in with a 59.1 leg. Brew, not having run a 400 since indoor Nationals, just did not run fast due to inexperience and possible doubt. Her 60.0 meant Jones would have to do something amazing. Jones did not play, running an excellent leg to finish in 55.9, giving Tech a 3:51.05. Three teams from the fast section beat their time, putting them 13th on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Nathan Peterson '12 improved his NCAA qualifying performance by winning the Pole Vault with an outstanding jump of 16-5 1/4. Peterson and three others were jumping at the height, but he was the only one to clear, and he did so on his final attempt. Also in the vault, Lauren Kuntz '13 placed third in the women's vault, clearing her usual 12-1 1/2, again having solid attempts at 12-7.
    
    
                  
    
    CK Umachi '12, placed second in the Hammer Throw with a 182-5 performance. After barely making the finals it was a nice comeback for Umachi. Also in the field events, Tilly Taylor '15 placed third in the Javelin Throw at 134'.
    
    
                  
    
    The final performance of the first day of competition for MIT was the 10K. Tania Morimoto '12 fighting an injury all spring, remained hopeful for making Nationals. The initial pace for the leaders was very fast, catching Morimoto by surprise. The two leaders opened up a thirty meter lead on the pack when Morimoto decided she needed to close the gap or risk not making a fast enough time. By the 3200 mark Morimoto had caught up to the leaders. After she caught them the pace slowed a bit, so Morimoto took the lead, knowing if they did not stay on pace they would not make the National field which would likely take a sub 36:20. Continuing to hammer out 86 second quarters, Morimoto did the work for the leaders, hitting the 5K in 17:59. This is about where things started to unravel for Morimoto. Never one to fear dying in a race, Morimoto continued to press despite the fact she was in significant pain. Even when she realized she would not run a qualifying time, she did not give up. Finishing in a fine time of 37:22.47, in fourth place, Morimoto finished her collegiate career in style.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two began with the women's 4x100 Relay. In order to improve the time of 47.48 it was necessary to expand the exchange zones, which is always a little risky. The first handoff between Brew and Gross looked to go a little too deep into the zone, possibly causing Gross to back off a little in order to make sure the handoff was safe. The second handoff to Simmons seemed right on, putting MIT in good position. The final handoff did not go well as Jones slowed down to make the handoff work. The final leg by Jones was half-spirited as she went through the motions rather than compete all out. The end result was a poor time of 48.20 for third place.
    
    
                  
    
    The next event was the 1500. Both Ben Mattocks '12 and Justin Bullock '14 were trying to gain qualifying times and both were in the fast section. The first quarter was a screaming 58 and Mattocks was right in the front. Bullock was being conservative but still came through in 60. At the half Mattocks was still up front at 2:00 while Bullock fell way off the back in 2:04 and dropped out not long afterwards. Mattocks continued to ride the train, splitting 3:04. As he made his way through the final turn, he briefly took the lead as he tried to kick it in for the victory. He battled all the way to the finish, ending up in second in 3:50.51, just .05 out of first. That is certainly a time that will make it to Nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones was up next in the 100HH final. As soon as she realized she was behind at the start she started to give up, and just like the 4x100, she just cruised in to finish seventh in a dismal 16.01.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 400, Gross ran, but was not her competitive self, finishing in 60.77. Running the 4x400 on day one may have taken its toll on many of the MIT relay members.
    
    
                  
    
    Alexandra Taylor '14 was giving it one last shot in the 800 this outdoor season. She was in the fast section, so the pace promised to be pretty quick as many were trying to improve their time for Nationals. The first 400 was an evenly paced 65 as Taylor went to the lead to start the second lap. However, on the back stretch she tightened up and was unable to hold onto the lead. She finished in 2:16.97.
    
    
                  
    
    Jamie Simmons '12 did not have a great day in the 400IH. She got out very well, looking great over the first hurdle. She stutter stepped the next few hurdles and seemed to lose steam on the sixth hurdle. Uncharacteristically, due to feeling ill, she was unable to come back, fading to seventh in 64.14.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones scratched out of the 200, but Gross ran a season best 25.50, looking very good the entire race despite the soft track. Also in the 200, Tyler Singer-Clark just did not have it, finishing in 22.09 for eighth place.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers now must wait to see who else around the country makes into the top 20 (men), 22 (women) or 16 (relays) and hope they are not bumped out. At the moment the men have Pat Marx '13 in the 800, Kyle Hannon '13 and Mattocks in the 1500, Serene in the 3000 Steeplechase, Dan Harper '12 in the 10K, Umachi in the Hammer and Peterson in the Pole Vault. The women have Jones in the 100HH, 200 and 400IH, Simmons in the 400IH, Elaine McVay '15 in the 10K, Taylor in the Javelin, Kuntz in the Pole Vault and both the 4x100 Relay and 4x400 Relay with Jones, Simmons, Gross and Brew.

    WOMEN RIDE RECORDS TO VICTORY, MEN PERFORM WELL BUT TOO SHORT-HANDED TO WIN
    
    
                  
    
    April 7, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    It seemed fate was trying to tell the MIT Track & Field team they should not compete this weekend in the Engineers Cup hosted by RPI in Troy, NY. For starters, a very unusual number of injuries were plaguing the team, few of which are the normal overuse injuries seen in track and field. Second, 40 minutes out of Boston, one of the two motor coaches broke down. After transferring those who had to compete earlier in the meet on the bus that was working the others waited for a replacement bus. Before the replacement bus could make it to them it had to stop for a flat tire. A third bus was sent and that was the charm as the Engineers finally made the meet about fifty minutes after the start, which was in time for their upcoming events.
    
    
                  
    
    The women defied the message fate was trying to send and had a very strong meet. Winning every single running event with the exception of the 4x400 Relay, in which they ran their B 4x400 team, and winning four of the eight field events, Tech easily won the meet, scoring 201 points to 110 for WPI and 81 for RPI. The men were simply too undermanned, missing 13 very key athletes for a variety of reasons, not all of which were injuries. The men's competitiveness was there, but with only six field event athletes and no one in the Discus Throw, Long Jump or Triple Jump, it just was not going to happen. Nevertheless, MIT placed second with 127 points to 177 for RPI and 102 for WPI.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor '15 had the highlight performance of the meet for MIT, launching a 140-3 javelin throw to smash the MIT record, both varsity and freshman, by 9', laying down a very strong NCAA Division III qualifying mark. Taylor's victory was not the only record producing performance for the Engineers. Jackie Brew '15, taking off nearly two feet behind the foul board, landed 18-1 3/4 beyond the foul board for a new MIT record and  a 6" PR. Cindy Huang '15 set a freshman record in the 800, running 2:21.87 with no competition as she won easily from wire to wire. Elaine McVay '15 also set a freshman record, hers in the 5K, running 17:41.24 for the victory on the windy day.
    
    
                  
    
    In addition to the records there were a plethora of victories. Marissa Engle '15 took first place honors in the Pole Vault, clearing 10-11 3/4. Christine Labaza '14 threw 108-2 to win the Discus Throw. Michelle Johnson '15 continued to set PR after PR. After jumping a personal best of 17' for second place in the Long Jump, she won the Triple Jump with a leap of 37-5 3/4, narrowly missing the MIT record.
    
    
                  
    
    In the running events, Portia Jones '12 did her usual damage to the opposition, winning the 100 and 200 and anchoring the 4x100 (Brew, Veronica Szklarzewski '15, Jamie Simmons '12) to victory. All of her events were into a strong wind, making fast times impossible, but she nevertheless ran 13.17, 25.89 and anchored the relay in 48.44. Brew also won the 100HH, just inching out Jones in 15.37 to 15.39. Jamie Simmons added a couple of victories to her sprint relay effort. In the 400, she battled a terrible head wind on the homestretch to win in 58.36 and then came back in the 400IH to win in 63.49 even though she virtually stopped coming into hurdle six. Brooke Johnson '13 shook off a nagging IT band problem to win the 1500 in 4:46.39. Claire O'Connell '14 won the 3000 Steeplechase in 11:59.13, showing much improved hurdling technique over last week.
    
    
                  
    
    For the men, Tyler Singer-Clark '14 won the 200 in 22.62, overcame a poor start to nearly win the 100, losing by .02 into the headwind and ran a superb leg on the makeshift 4x100 Relay that ran 43.61 with two replacement legs (DJ Ronde '13, Mac Gager '14). Sam Parker '15 was not seriously challenged as he easily pulled away from the field in the 800 to win in 1:57.52, leading MIT to a 1-2-3 finish. Kyle Hannon '13 also led a 1-2-3 sweep, as he and his Tech teammates severely negatively split  the 1500, running 2:02 in the second half of the race to win in 4:07.46. Benji Xie '15 ran a superb race in the 5K, fighting off a suicide pace by an RPI runner trying to steal the race, to win in 15:22.07. The only field event victory was earned by CK Umachi '12 in the Hammer Throw as he threw 164-5 despite an aggravating groin injury.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT travels to Colby College to face the host as well as Bates College. Hopefully Tech will return many of those not competing this past weekend.

    Women Manage Easy Victory While Men Succumb to Outstanding Bates Squad
    
    
                  
    
    April 14, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    MIT Track & Field traveled three plus hours to Waterville, Maine on Saturday to compete against Host Colby College, Bates College, University of Southern Maine and Husson University (women only). The site of the meet rotates annually between Bates, Colby and MIT and this was the year to go to the furthest non-championship travel destination for the MIT team.
    
    
                  
    
    It seems each year the team travels to Colby some key performer misses the early bus (8:00 a.m.) due to oversleeping. This year it was Sheldon Trotman '15, who was expected to score big points in the LJ, TJ, HJ and 100 Meter Dash. As it was, Tech was missing a very unusual amount of star athletes due to injury or illness. While there are always a handful of injuries on any team, most are of the nagging type that can be managed throughout a season, but many of these are enough to put the athletes out for a few days to a few weeks and no two are the same. Even the women were down a few key bodies, but not enough to derail the train.
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT approach entering the meet was to go after Bates College, winners of the Men's Indoor New England Division III Championship. Bates has a very strong and well balanced team. It would take a healthier and more complete MIT team than got off the bus, but since you never know what will happen once the gun goes off, the Engineers were going to try their best for the victory without putting anyone in jeopardy. For the women, as long as MIT competed well they should have no difficulty recording the win.
    
    
                  
    
    When all was said and done the women won handily with 198.5 points to 152 for Bates, 146.5 for Colby, 130 for Southern Maine and 44 for Husson University. The men managed a second place with 183 points to 254 for Bates, 113 for Colby and 98 for Southern Maine.
    
    
                  
    
    The women won eight events, with Portia Jones '12 pulling down three of the victories, preferring to save her energy at the start of the races to make for dramatic victories at the finish line in  the 100, 100HH and 200. The weather was to the benefit of the sprinters, with 65 degrees and gusts in excess of 30 mph. Jones ran times of 12.41, 14.46 and 25.25, all season bests. Jamie Simmons '12 ran her first 100 of the year to warmup for her 400IH and ran an impressive 12.52, good for number two on MIT's all-time list. She then proceeded to run a season best of 62.39, despite slightly stuttering the first seven hurdles, to win the event. Brooke Johnson '13 ran her first 5000 of the year, a 17:35.1 PR under windy conditions, good for 26th on the NCAA Division III list. The women's other victories were in the field events. Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 competed for the first time this season, winning the High Jump with a freshman record of 5-1 3/4. Joanna Chen '15 worked through her problems in the Pole Vault to win at 10-11 3/4. Tilly Taylor '15 made it two in a row with another victory in the Javelin. She again threw over 130', this time a 132-7.
    
    
                  
    
    Other performances of note for the women were another freshman record in the 800 by Cindy Huang. This week, Huang lowered the record to 2:19.53 as she claimed second place. Alexandra Taylor '14 made her debut in the 3000 Steeplechase, running a very fine 11:32.89 for fourth place and the sixth fastest time in MIT history. Kali Benavides '15 smashed her previous personal best in the 5K, running 18:34.4 for seventh place.
    
    
                  
    
    The men again had no one in the Triple Jump or Long Jump and only one thrower in the Shot Put, Discus and Hammer Throw. Nevertheless, Tech won seven events. Tyler Singer-Clark '14 was the only double winner, taking both the 200 and 400 Meter Dashes. In the 200 Singer-Clark used the little wind that remained at that time of the meet and broke 22 seconds for the first time, clocking 21.97. In the 400, he had to run into the full force of the strong winds earlier in the meet, crossing the line in 50.54. In both events Nick Diamantoni '15 finished second (22.40, 51.01). Dan Harper '12 remained undefeated in the 5K and 10K. Just planning on winning the event, Harper took over the lead once the initial fast pace had begun to slow, making it his job to pull teammate Roy Wedge '14 to a New England Division III qualifying time of sub 15:30. Hammering 73 second quarters, Harper ran 15:19.12 with ease and Wedge followed in second place with a 15:21.72. The other running event victories came in the two relays, the 4x100 and 4x400. In the 4x100, Tech ran their third different anchor leg in this the third meet of the season. This week, the honors went to Matt Falk '12 when Trotman missed the bus. Falk had never practiced the event and only got in two run-throughs in the warmup. DJ Ronde '13 did not get out well and then leaned forward too much to run his top speed. Singer-Clark took off a little late and Ronde ran up on him. Singer-Clark made up a lot of ground on the field, putting Diamantoni in good position. Diamantoni put MIT in the lead and Falk took off perfectly, but then suddenly put the brakes on and looked back. By the time he got moving again, Diamantoni had caught him and had to wait for Falk to get into the zone. Somehow they maintained the lead and Falk showed he has some speed, maintaining the lead to the finish line. In the 4x400, a makeshift group was thrown together and they all stepped up very nicely. David Way '13 led off with a 52.4, much better than his open 400. Justin Bullock returned from the 800 to run a fine 51.0. John Thomas '15, running his first 400 leg of the year, turned an impressive 50.5 to bring MIT even with Colby. Sam Parker '15 took the baton, running on the heels of the Colby anchor until the final turn. Using much better form than the end of the 800 Parker slowly moved past his opponent to win by .02 in 3:24.77.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, Thomas pulled off a win in the High Jump by clearing 6' 2" and narrowly missed 6' 4". The other victory was earned by Cameron Wagar '15 in the Javelin. In his first outdoor meet, Wagar threw 191-2 for a new freshman record.
    
    
                  
    
    Other impressive performances were had in a few different events. Parker ran 1:55.91 in the 800 to just miss out on first place honors. Eric Safai '14 continued to improve in the Steeplechase, this week running more than a 10 second PR to place fourth in 9:46.12. In the Pole Vault, Yida Gao '13 and Colin Hong '15 both cleared season bests of 14-1 1/4 to place third and fourth. Although CK Umachi '12 did not win any events, he competed well, throwing season bests of 176-10 in the Hammer and 151-4 in the Discus. Also competing in the Javelin, Harry Rein '15 threw 165-0 for third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT will send a few athletes to Princeton's Larry Ellis Invitational to race in the 800, 1500, 3000SC, and 5K. The remainder of the team will either rest up for the start of the championship season in two weeks or race in MIT's Spring Invite.

    UMACHI, SIMMONS LEAD STRONG MIT EFFORT AT NCAA DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
                  
    
    May 24-26, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    MIT sent seven men and seven women qualifiers to the NCAA Division III Championship, hosted by Claremont-McKenna-Scripps in Claremont, CA. This is a remarkable number of qualifiers given the challenge of making the championship field. In order to qualify an individual had to be top 20 in the country on the men's list or top 22 on the women's list. For a relay team to qualify they had to be among the top 16 teams in the country. Track and Field at the Division III level is exploding with talent in recent years and this is by far the best year yet. While getting to Nationals is extremely difficult, with trial rounds in all running events with the exception of the 5K and 10K and with no one wanting to lead in the distance events, most events from the 1500 up tend to be very strategic, making it even more challenging to make the finals in these events.
    
    
                  
    
    This year, like many years, the National Championship is the same week as MIT final exams. MIT left campus late Tuesday, the second day of exams. Many athletes had their exams moved to early in the week and others would have them proctored while at the NCAA Division III Championship. All three times MIT has been among the top four teams in the country at the outdoor championship, the exams were completed the week before Nationals, giving the athletes an opportunity to focus on track & field and nothing else.
    
    
                  
    
    The athletes disregarded their fatigue and competed like they always do. Some even raising the bar competitively if not in overall performance due to strategic efforts by their opponents. The first day was a very busy day for MIT. First up was the Women's 4x100 Relay. MIT was ranked 13th out of the 16 teams, but thought if they could extend the handoffs deeper into the first half of each zone and get the speed out of injured athlete, Jackie Brew '14, they could make the finals. Brew ran well, as did Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12 and Portia Jones '12, and the handoffs were there, but the quality of the field was just too much for MIT. There time was 47.83, their second fastest time of the year, but not enough to make it to finals. 
    
    
                  
    
    Next up for Tech was the Men's 1500. Both Ben Mattocks '12 and Kyle Hannon '13 were in the field. Hannon was up first, and with by far the most experience of the two, knew what he had to do to make finals. However, the uncompetitive Hannon showed up and fell out the back shortly after a nice first 400, which was set up well at 61 seconds. From there he continued to drop, eventually finishing last in 4:18. Mattocks has done a tremendous job of competing the past month, dropping 10 seconds off his previous PR of 4:00. Similar to the first section, the first quarter was out in 61 seconds. Mattocks stayed in it, positioning himself well through splits of 2:04 and 3:08. Mattocks finished at 3:54.13 to make it to the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons was up for her second race of the day, the 400IH. She had a great start and her primary challenge, that of not picking up the hurdle visually soon enough to adjust her stride, seemed to be in check. At hurdle five she stuttered a bit, but came on strong on the homestretch. At hurdle 10 she took 10 stutter steps, nearly stopping, but she regained the lead, winning her section at 61.16.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones was next, representing MIT in the 200, an event in which she placed fifth in 2011. Her start seemed a bit delayed, possibly because the race was started while the announcer was giving the lineup. Nevertheless she had too much time to makeup and finished in 24.74, not enough to make finals.
    
    
                  
    
    The first finals for MIT were the 10K races where Tech had Elaine McVay '15 in the women's race and Dan Harper '12 representing the men. For both it would be the first time at outdoor nationals. McVay went with the leaders, demonstrating her usual "no fear of dying" strategy. The first 1600 was a crisp 5:42. She stayed up front for the second mile, coming through in 11:28. McVay started falling back a little in the third mile, slowing to 88 second pace, while her third 1600 was in 5:50. Making the early move to go with the eventual winner hit her hard as her final three 1600 splits were 6:01, 6:08 and 6:04. Her final time of 37:00.15 was far off her best, but her 11th place finish was better than she was seeded, showing how hard she raced. Harper, running with no fear all season, even finishing second at the IC4A Championship in 30:07, was seeded 11th coming into the race, but thought he could win. At the beginning of the race, his inexperience showed as he reacted to every move made during the first 1600, which was a pedestrian 5:00. The second mile picked up a bit but Harper did not respond well, appearing to doubt himself for the first time this season, he only ran a 4:55 second 1600, hanging back around eighth place. The third mile picked up some more as the pack moved to cover a breakaway, but Harper only ran 4:53, giving up on trying to win. In the final three miles, Harper would come alive for a few strides then fall back to 5:00 pace. He finally moved in the final 400, closing in 67, but was unable to gain All America status as he placed ninth in 31:08.02. 
    
    
                  
    
    Stephen Serene '12, nearly as much a surprise this season as Mattocks, needed to finish among the top five in his heat or one of the next four fastest times. The pace was pretty quick for the first 1600, but nothing too fast, coming through in 4:52. The next two laps slowed but Serene took charge at the end, closing in 74 and 35 for the final 600 meters to finish in fourth, qualifying automatically for the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event of day one for MIT was the Women's 4x400 relay, the third event of the day for Jones and Simmons. MIT was again seeded 13th of the 16 teams, but knew they could run faster. Simmons got things started with a 55.8 leadoff to put MIT well in the lead in their heat. Gross, as can be expected at Nationals, put together a 57.6 leg to put MIT in a strong second place. Brew, despite not being able to practice well for the past month and a half ran a strong 58.0. Jones ran a well paced, strong 55.9 to bring MIT home in third place in a season best of 3:47.22, advancing to the finals with the fourth best time overall.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two began with the Men's Hammer Throw. CK Umachi '12 was seeded 15th and not given much chance to get into the nine man final. The first flight had three good throws, but most competitors threw less than expected. Umachi was in the second of two flights. On his first throw he got a good release. The hammer landed with no room to spare on the left sector line and was an eight foot PR of 194-5. This put Umachi in fourth place at the time. As the flight progressed he slipped to seventh place. On his first throw in the finals he fell out the front as he watched the release, and that may have been a better throw. However, no one passed him and he scored the first points for MIT, earning his second All America award in his career.
    
    
                  
    
    Later in the day, Jones was up in the 100HH, an event she was second in last year. Throughout the year Jones paid less attention to the details of hurdle drills and often cut hurdle workouts short. The effects of that were less than desirable outcomes in the hurdle races throughout the season. With a poor start and hitting the first hurdle, she was visibly frustrated. While she did not give up, she was too far behind to make up the ground. Her time in the trials was 14.49, not nearly enough to make the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    The final competitor of the day for MIT was Pat Marx '13 in the 800. Marx was seeded pretty far down the list, and again, not expected to make the finals, but there was no question he had the ability if the race broke correctly for him. The start was clean and the pace right, coming through the 400 in 54.7. Early in the first 400 he positioned himself well, but then fell into his old habits of getting on the rail and not leaving himself any room to move out should someone come up on him. Of course, he got boxed in and had to wait until near the 500 mark to get around. Trying to move up out of the back against the wind and fighting all of the elbows was too much for Marx. He ran a solid race but did not advance as his 1:52.68 was not quite fast enough.
    
    
                  
    
    The final day of competition began with the Women's Pole Vault. Lauren Kuntz '13 was representing MIT in the event she had placed fourth in the year before with a PR of 12-7 1/4. She had vaulted 12-1 1/2 many times this year, but no higher. She cleared 12-5 1/2 and was one of nine competitors remaining to attempt 12-7 1/4. She was in seventh place going into the new height, but was unable to clear it and the two competitors behind her on misses made the height, giving Kuntz a ninth place finish, one place out of All America honors.
    
    
                  
    
    While the Pole Vault was going on, Serene was up in the Steeplechase. For a first timer to make it to finals was exceptional and Serene was determined to make it to the awards stand. The pace was slower than the trials at the start, but by the 1600 mark was 4:50, two seconds ahead. Serene fell off the torrid pace of the leaders, running in contention for eighth place, six seconds ahead of the trials pace at the 2400 meter mark. Moving hard Serene was unable to catch eighth place, even though he ran a 9:09.23 time, by far his second best ever.
    
    
                  
    
    Mattocks was up next for MIT, another first timer, who ran amazingly well to make it to the finals, already surpassing his seed. At the start of the race it was apparent no one wanted to take the lead. The pedestrian pace was 65 for the first 400 and a ridiculous 2:14 for the 800. Since Mattocks was much more of a distance runner coming down to race the 1500, having never broken 2:00 in the 800, he knew he was in trouble. The pace jumped quickly and he did his best to go with them, running 61 for the third quarter and 44 seconds for the final 300 was not even close to the speed of the others in the race. Mattocks 1:45 pace for the final 700 meters still had him finish last in 4:00.57, ending a remarkable month of May in his senior year.
    
    
                  
    
    The Men's Pole Vault was next for the Engineers. Nathan Peterson '12, a two time indoor All American, who had not made the outdoor field of participants until this year, knew he was going to earn All America status. Peterson was tied for seventh seed at 16-5, a mark that would certainly make All America if achieved. Peterson cleared 15-11 on his first attempt after passing the first two heights. However, at 16-2 he was unable to make the height, giving him a tie for ninth, the third ninth place finish for the Engineers on the this day and fourth so far in the championship.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 400IH, Simmons would be racing her final individual race for MIT. Placing second as a sophomore and fourth as a junior, Simmons was determined to win this year. She got out very well and did not stutter any hurdles until number five. She had a very strong final turn, taking the lead as she entered the home stretch. Going in the last two hurdles she stuttered quite a bit, but maintained the lead. As she approached the finish line it appeared she would win the elusive individual title, but with less than a meter to go she was passed on the outside. Her new MIT record of 60.36 earned her another NCAA Division III runner-up award.
    
    
                  
    
    Tilly Taylor '15 was entered in the Javelin, seeded 11th. She had some solid throws, but her best was only 133-2, not enough to make it to finals. Taylor's shoulder had been bothering her during the week and likely affected her performance.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event for MIT was the Women's 4x400. Simmons had not had adequate time to cool-down after the 400IH race as she was called to the awards stand to receive her award. Either Simmons or Coach Halston Taylor should have pulled the plug on the awards presentation, delaying it until later, as Simmons sat for nearly 20 minutes while she waited on the poorly organized awards group. This definitely had an affect on her performance in the 4x400. Simmons is always capable of delivering a 55 second leadoff, but her fatigue from the 400IH and lack of cooldown prevented her from doing better than a 57.3. However, Gross stepped up and delivered a very competitive 56.8 to put MIT in fourth place. Brew maintained MIT's position throughout the first 300 meters, then lost one position on the homestretch, running a very respectable 58.3. Jones went out with a strong sense of urgency, smoking the first 200, bringing MIT back to third place by the 200 mark and looking as though she may have a chance at second. However, when she hit the 300 mark she began dying and at 350 really locked up. She maintained a hold on fifth place up to the finish when after two more teams passed her she prematurely put on the brakes a meter before the finish line. At that point one more team passed her, putting MIT in eighth place in 3:48.77. Jones ran a 56.2 leg, a fine leg, but not running through the finish cost MIT at least one place.
    
    
                  
    
    Overall, MIT's performances were strong and placed MIT higher than they were seeded in nearly every event. Unfortunately this did not translate into many points. The women finished in a tie for 26th with nine points. The men finished in a tie for 68th with two points. The 2012 season was a tremendous success with both teams winning the NEWMAC Conference Championshp and the men winning the New England Division III Championship with the women claiming second, but somehow it seems these championships were a disappointment and put an unpleasant cap on an otherwise very satisfying year. Perhaps the level of success for the women, achieving a third and fourth place finish at these championships the past two years had expectations too high. Of the 14 qualifiers, eight are seniors, three are juniors, one a sophomore and two are freshmen. Many just missed making the National Championship, so hopefully MIT will be back with a large group in 2013.

    MEN FOLLOW SINGER-CLARK, HARPER AND UMACHI TO DIVISION III TITLE, WOMEN TAKE SECOND
    
    
                  
    
    May 3-5, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT Men's Track & Field team finally broke through for the team title in the New England Division III Championship after four straight years of being the bride's maid, the last two years single digit losses. Some extraordinary performances propelled Tech to the victory with 113 points on their home track, finishing 15.5 points ahead of second place Williams College. The women's team could not make up for the points lost to injuries, finishing second with 124 points to Williams College.
    
    
                  
    
    The men began day three with a slight lead over favored Bates College and the always tough Ephs of Williams. On Friday, the second day of the Championship, Dan Harper '12 in a season long quest to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championships, having already run 30:37 and 30:30 earlier in the season, performances that any other year would go to the NCAA Championship, but this year would not. Beginning the day ranked 25th in the country for Division III, Harper took to the track in yet another effort to lower his time, but also to bring MIT a victory. Doing all the work by himself once it was apparent no one wanted to help out after an initial 76 second 400, Harper ripped 72-73 second 400's the rest of the way. Harper hit 1600 splits of 4:54, 4:52, 4:53, 4:55, 4:54 and 4:46 before finishing with a 66 last 400 to run 30:20.42, finishing 1:05 ahead of second place and moving to 18th on the NCAA list. Also running amazing races for MIT were Roy Wedge '14 finishing fifth in a PR of 31:30.87, Benji Xie '15 finishing  sixth in a PR of 31:34.91 as well as non-scorers Matthew Jordan '15 in a PR of 32:05.33, Allen Leung '15 in a PR of 32:06.37 and Matt Weaver '12 running a PR in 33:09.27.
    
    
                  
    
    Also scoring points on day two was CK Umachi '12, who placed fourth in the Discus Throw with a mark of 152-10. In the Javelin Throw, freshmen Cameron Wagar and Harry Rein earned sixth and eighth places with marks of 179-11 and 175-6 respectively. Rein's mark was a personal best.
    
    
                  
    
    So, entering day three MIT knew they did not have much room for error, but as in any meet poor performances happened. Fortunately for MIT, true in any championship team, when someone did not get the job done, someone else stepped up and took over the responsibility. In the first final on the track, the 3000 Steeplechase, Stephen Serene '12, Eric Safai '14 and Logan Trimble '13 tried to bring MIT some points. Serene was seeded fourth at 9:20, but when the leaders took it out aggressively he did not go with them. Safai, not seeded to score, was probably being too competitive, throwing caution to the wind and went right with them, hitting the 1600 in 4:47. At that point Safai started the long, painful death unique to this race, but never gave up. Serene rallied at the end to finish sixth in 9:22.39 and Safai hung on for a monstrous PR of 9:25.21, good for seventh. Trimble also ran a personal best, 9:41.76, but did not score.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up, in the 4x100 relay, Mike DuPlessis '14, Tyler Singer-Clark '14, Nick Diamantoni '15 and Sheldon Trotman '15 took the third seeded Engineers to a second place finish in 42.65 despite a poor third handoff due to Trotman leaving a hair too early.
    
    
                  
    
    The 1500 was next and MIT was expecting some big points. Number one seed Kyle Hannon '13 never got into the race, falling to the back of the pack and never moving up. However, Ben Mattocks '12 ran another superb race. Last week, Mattocks ran a four second personal best at the NEWMAC Championship. Mattocks did not think, just competed, going through splits of 64, 2:05 and 3:07 before finishing in sixth in 3:53.35. Justin Bullock '14, running from the slower section, won his section in a personal best of 3:55.41 to finish in eighth overall.
    
    
                  
    
    Meanwhile, Umachi was delivering again, this time taking second in the Hammer Throw with a personal best of 186-1, moving him to number 11 on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Pole Vault, Nathan Peterson '12 came through once again, this time winning with a 15-11 jump. Also scoring for Tech was Yida Gao '13, who cleared 14-5 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, Singer-Clark, Diamantoni and DJ Ronde '13 were set to represent MIT in the 400 Meter Dash. Singer-Clark, seeded fourth, obviously did not see the seed list, because he ran an outstanding race, easily pulling away from the field in the final 100 to run 48.55 for the victory. Also running PR's, but not scoring, Diamantoni ran 50.39 and Ronde ran 50.42.
    
    
                  
    
    Perhaps the biggest surprise in the meet for MIT was what DuPlessis did in the 100. Seeded 11th and only practicing for two weeks after coming back from injury, DuPlessis first made the 100 final by running 11.28 in the trials, then dropped an 11.09 bomb to steal third place, giving MIT six big points.
    
    
                  
    
    The hits kept on coming for the Engineers as Pat Marx '13 and Sam Parker '15 delivered in the 800. Certainly the deepest and highest quality field in the meet with 14 runners listed under 1:55, Marx and Parker were both in the fast section and hoping for a fast start. In the slower section, led by the defending national champion Ben Sheetz of Amherst, winning in 1:52.02, four finished under 1:53. In the fast section, Marx made a bid to win a little late, but still finished in third in a personal best 1:51.80 and Parker ran a best of 1:53.57, but finished in ninth to just miss scoring.
    
    
                  
    
    Singer-Clark brought the magic back in the 200, lighting the track up with a 21.67 victory, another huge personal best and another 10 points for MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    Going into the 5K, it was clear this event would decide the meet. In the past two years, Williams scored big points in the 5K to seal the team victory. With a 12 point lead for MIT going into the event and with Williams having the first and sixth seeds, Harper knew MIT's hopes rested on his shoulders. The pace was very fast right from the start. By the mile mark Harper was up with the leaders at 4:45. Wedge, Serene and Xie were also coming back from tough races and were in the thick of this one at 4:46. At the 3200 mark Harper was still there at 9:31. Wedge had fallen back a bit but was hanging tough at 9:33. Serene was back at 9:36 while Xie had to stop due to cramps. Although he fell off the leaders in the final mile due to a sharp increase in pace, Harper rallied with a 69 last lap and a 31 final 200 to place third in a huge PR of 14:42.97. Williams' runners ran well with three under 15:00, but none scored, locking up the meet for MIT as long as they scored at least two points in the two remaining relays and only then if Williams were to win both the 4x400 and 4x800 relays. Wedge did not score but ran a PR of 14:58.67. Serene also ran a personal best, his in 15:02.83.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x800, Gil O'Neil ran a superb leadoff of 1:56.7 to put MIT among the three leading teams. Bullock dropped a 1:54.6 to put MIT in the lead. Jared Forman '13 ran 1:57.5 to put Tech in third going into the final leg. Parker took over the anchor duties, but had the wrong frame of mind. Instead of going for the victory he protected third place, only running 1:58.2, giving MIT a 7:47.04 third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Singer-Clark led off the 4x400, but knowing MIT had won the meet probably took some of the adrenalin out of him as he only ran 49.5. Diamantoni, who has had problems running faster in the relay than in the open race, was only able to run 50.8. John Thomas '15 ran a solid 50.5 and Marx anchored MIT to third place in 49.1 and an overall time of 3:20.22.
    
    
                  
    
    The women, defending New England Division III Outdoor Track & Field champions and winners  two of the last three years, were thirty point underdogs going into this year's championship, primarily due to  injuries, which kept key performers such as Brooke Johnson '13, Kristine Bunker '14, Jackie Konopka '14, Veronica Szklarzewski '15 out of the meet, and others such as Jackie Brew '14 limited to what they would be able to do.
    
    
                  
    
    On Friday night, freshman super runner, Elaine McVay '15, using her 5K time to get her into the 10K field, ran with the leaders through a perfect pace of 86 and 87 second quarters. The three in the lead group hit 1600 splits of 5:51, 5:48, 5:46, 5:51, 5:50 and 5:46. McVay took over in the final six laps, opening up a small gap before closing the victory with an 82 last 400 to finish in 36:14.88. McVay is now ranked 13th on the NCAA list. Tania Morimoto '12, who had been suffering from a foot problem for most of the season, went with the leaders. She was able to hold on through 3600 meters, but then fell off the pace. She was able to hold onto seventh place in 38:30.85. Kaitlyn Allen '14, running her second 10K in two weeks, lowered her PR by nearly a minute, closing her season out with a 39:09.33, missing on scoring by one place. Dacie Manion '15, one of the top seeds in the race, was unable to finish.
    
    
                  
    
    Also on Friday, Jackie Brew '14 put her ailing hip flexor to the test in the Long Jump. Without being able to practice for three weeks and having an inhibited range of motion, she was only able to jump 17-2, good for seventh place.
    
    
                  
    
    Going into Saturday, MIT was already pretty far behind Williams College, which had scored 24 points to MIT's 14. Going into the Steeplechase, MIT was seeded seventh and eighth, but all three entries were capable of pulling off a big surprise. Martina de Geus '14, was afraid to go with the leaders and their ambitious pace, so she settled to run instead of race. She eventually pushed the end to finish in seventh in a season best 11:09.02. Claire O'Connell '14, still new to the race, had a lot of problems with the barriers, usually stuttering up to them and then further decelerating due to being too close to hurdle it well. Nevertheless she missed placing by 12 seconds as she ran a PR of 11:26.39. 
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x100, the quartet of Brew, Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12 and Portia Jones '12 ran a season best of 47.48 to place second. The handoffs were crisp but the first two could be a little deeper in the zone, perhaps giving MIT the opportunity to get under 47 seconds. They are currently ranked 11th on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500, Johnson gave it a try and even though the fast pace of 2:25 for the first 800 seemed easy, her IT Band was too painful to finish the race. Louise van den Heuvel '14 ran a season best of 4:45.14, but it was not fast enough to score.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones and Brew were in the 100HH final and took advantage of the opportunity. Jones won going away in a season best of 14.34. Brew, in fourth place going into the final hurdle, hit the hurdle with her lead foot, nearly falling, but staying up to take seventh in 15.10.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field, Tilly Taylor '15 remained undefeated, winning the Javelin with a throw of 138-7. Also in the field events, fellow freshmen, Preethi Vaidyanathan and Michelle Johnson, scored in their respective events, the High Jump and Triple Jump. Vaidyanathan placed third with a jump of 5' 3" and Johnson jumped 35-9 1/2 to place sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons and Gross scored big for MIT in the 400, both running season bests. Simmons ran 56.51 for a close second place while Gross ran 58.67 for a surprise and much needed fifth.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones was back again, this time in the 100. Running a season best of 12.27, Jones placed second, finishing behind Briana Wise of Worcester State, the same person she almost walked down in the 4x100 Relay.
    
    
                  
    
    Alexandra Taylor '14 continued to race well in the 800. Going with the leaders, who ran 63 for the first 400, she fatigued along with the others, but held on well enough to earn fifth place in a new personal best of 2:15.58. Cindy Huang '15 was unable to hang on after the fast first 400, finishing in 2:19.12.
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons was back on the track in the 400IH. With less than an hour after such a quality performance, it was understandable that Simmons got out a little slower than usual. However, when she got around the first turn she realized she was very far behind. Moving hard on the backstretch, she made up a lot of ground but ran out of track as she finished in 61.92 for third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones, on the track one more time in an individual event, again finished second, this time in the 200. Jones ran a season best of 24.98, again finishing behind Wise of Worcester State. Gross supported with a sixth place season best of 25.79.
    
    
                  
    
    As the Shot Put and Pole Vault were finishing, it was unclear how Williams was doing in both events, and whether MIT would get 19, 17 or 15 points in the vault. Because MIT and Williams were close enough that MIT might be able to pull out the victory in the relays, McVay was back on the track in the 5K. The pace was not a great deal faster than the 10K the night before, but 83 pace for the first mile was plenty as the leaders came through in 5:29. The second mile slowed to a 5:37, which was fine with McVay. In the final mile she tried to pull away but there was not enough there. She held on for third in 17:26.37, just 11 seconds off her PR.
    
    
                  
    
    As the women were starting their 4x800, it was learned Lauren Kuntz '13 had placed second in the Pole Vault at 12-1 1/2 to get second place in a jump-off. Joanna Chen '15 got a fifth place in a personal best of 11-1 3/4. Kate Wymbs '14 also jumped a personal best, good for sixth place at 10-8. Marissa Engle '14 placed seventh, also at 10-8.
    
    
                  
    
    This made it impossible to catch Williams, so the 4x400 team was scratched since Jones and Simmons had such a full day and Brew was hurting from her injured hip flexor. Nevertheless, the 4x800 was on the track and hoping to win their event. Taylor led off, going out in 65 and finishing in 2:16.4 to put MIT in the lead. van den Heuvel took over the baton duties, but did not take control of the race, only going out in 69 and then getting left behind a bit in 2:20.8. Margaret Coad '15 was responsible for the third leg and did a great job of competing, staying with the leaders until the final 200 and finishing in 2:19.5. Huang anchored the relay, and even though she went out in 65 was unable to close the gap significantly. She faded on the final lap, ending in 2:18.0 for an overall time of 9:14.89, good for third place.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT hosts the NEICAAA Championship, which is the All Division New England Championship, pitting all Division I, II and III team against each other.

    JONES, HARPER HAVE STELLAR WEEKEND PERFORMANCES TO LEAD MIT
    
    
                  
    
    May 11-12, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    2012 was one of the rare years where both the IC4A Championship (the oldest and most prestigious conference in the country) and the NEICAAA Championship (All Division New England Championship) fell on the same weekend. Many schools are members of both organizations and had to choose or split their squads. MIT chose to send two males to the IC4A meet and the remainder to the NEICAAA meet, which was hosted by MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    Dan Harper '12, continued his quest to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship 10K. Already having run 30:37, 30:30 and 30:20, Harper keeps getting passed on the NCAA list, where only the top 20 performers are chosen to compete. He entered the IC4A field hoping the competition would be adequate to finally allow him to get some help for the entire race. The pace began extremely slow, coming through the 1200 in 3:47, until someone picked up the pace just short of the first mile. From that point on the lead pack ran 71-72 pace until 800 meters to go. With two laps remaining, Geoghegan of Syracuse made a break away and only Harper responded. That next to last lap was a 69 for Harper with the final circuit being run in 64, but it was not enough to win as Harper settled for second place in a new PR of 30:07.44, a time that ranks 13th on the NCAA Division III list and one Harper is willing to sit on with one week to go to qualify.
    
    
                  
    
    Back at MIT, at the NEICAAA Championship, day one had a number of outstanding performances despite the strong winds. MIT was resting some athletes and simply trying to qualify others for the NCAA Championship, choosing to not run the 4x100 or 4x400 in the women's competition and certainly not trying to maximize points.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, CK Umachi '12 placed fourth in the Hammer Throw, throwing 184-2 after nearly fouling out in the trials. Lauren Kuntz '13 continued to lock on 12-1 1/2, placing second. Kuntz did have two very good attempts at 12-5 and should be ready for that height at Nationals. Joanna Chen '15 matched her personal best with an 11-1 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, Portia Jones '12 had a busy day, running three events; the 100HH, 200 and 400 meter dashes. In the hurdle trials, despite a slow start, Jones corrected her form and raced well to a season best 14.32 to qualify for finals. In the 400, she ran casually, easily making the final in 57.19. Her 200 was the best this outdoor season, a 24.58 to again make the finals. Martha Gross '12 also ran a season best in the 200, a 25.54, very close to her 25.40 PR.
    
    
                  
    
    Jamie Simmons '12 had her fastest 400IH of the season, despite stuttering nearly every hurdle. Her 61.31 shows she can easily break the minute barrier if she can visually set up the next hurdle after going over the previous hurdle.
    
    
                  
    
    Saturday was a very sunny, and even hot day by New England standards, with temperatures in the 80's even though there was a strong wind throughout the day. The men ended the competition with 39 points, good for sixth place overall as three MIT athletes earned second place finishes. The women combined for 26 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Nathan Peterson '12 earned second place with a 16-4 3/4 vault, nearly making 16-9. Peterson's vault is good for seventh on the NCAA list. Yida Gao '13 cleared 13-11 1/4. 
    
    
                  
    
    In the Triple Jump, Michelle Johnson '15 had an excellent competition, finishing seventh with a nice jump of 37-7 3/4, good for a new Freshman Record. Sheldon Trotman '15 also jumped but was unable to place with his 44-7 1/2 performance.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track Jones led the way for the women, placing in three events. In the 100HH final, she ran a season best of 14.28, good for third place. With the 400 close in time to the hurdles, and with the 200 up a little later, she did not extend herself in the one lapper, placing eighth. In the 200, a tired Jones managed a fifth place season best of 24.51, putting her seventh on the current NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Singer-Clark lit the track up with yet another PR of 21.62 to garner second place. Also earning second place for the men was a remarkable 3:54.56 in extremely windy conditions in the 1500 Meter Race by Ben Mattocks '12, out of the second of three sections. Also placing in the 1500 was Justin Bullock '14, finishing in seventh in 3:55.55.
    
    
                  
    
    Jamie Simmons ran a season best of 60.84, good for fourth place in the 400IH. She was in position to win, even running into the wind on the backstretch as she was clean through seven hurdles, but then lost focus on the hurdles and stuttered the final three. Simmons is now second on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Stephen Serene '12 lowered his Steeplechase best to 9:17.33 in his pursuit of making the NCAA Championship. Serene placed fifth, but will probably need a sub 9:10 to make it to the big dance.
    
    
                  
    
    The final scoring effort for MIT was the men's 4x400 relay. Running first was Singer-Clark who lit up the track with a 48.4 leadoff. Sam Parker '15, who had run 1:54.73 in the 800 earlier in the day, ran a 400 best of 49.4 to handoff in fifth place. DJ Ronde '13 took over baton duties, running a personal best 49.7, although he handed off in seventh to Pat Marx '13. Marx, always better when running from behind, split 48.4 to catch two teams, giving MIT a fifth place 3:16.08.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT travels to RPI in Troy, NY to race in the ECAC Division III Championship, a last chance qualifier of sorts.

    MIT Engineers NEWMAC Conference Championship Victories--Men win 12th in Row, Women 4th
    
    
                  
    
    April 28, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    Although both the men's and women's teams still have some key injuries, many of their hurt athletes are back and doing just fine. Both teams performed brilliantly at the NEWMAC Conference Championship, hosted by Smith College, with the men gathering nine victories and the women eight. Despite the cool temperatures and windy conditions, the men scored 267 points, easily outdistancing runner-up WPI with 179 points. The women, who pulled out the top three seeds in the 5K once the victory was secure, scored 208 points to runner-up Wheaton's 144 points.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT seems to be rounding into championship form at the right time. Sheldon Trotman '15 showed just how much the Engineers missed him as he put together a very impressive meet. Trotman jumped a 6-5 PR in the High Jump to win that event, just missed 22' in the Long Jump to finish second and won the Triple Jump with a 45' effort. Michael DuPlessis '14 competed for the first time this season, placing second in the 100 in 11.11 and leading off the 4x100 Relay with a tremendous leg to set MIT up for a second place in 42.59.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT scored more than 60 over their seeds. Not seeded to score in the 10K as none of the MIT entries had run the race this season, MIT began scoring some of those unseeded points in the very first event. Matthew Jordan '15 ran an outstanding race, placing third in 32:27.63 and teammates Ricardo Paez '15 and Matt Weaver '12 placed 5th and 6th in 33:15.86 and 33:25.94.
    
    
                  
    
    After an excellent third place finish in the 3000 Steeplechase by Eric Safai '14, running a PR of 9:33.62 to join teammates Stephen Serene '12 in second and Logan Trimble '13 in sixth, DuPlessis, Tyler Singer-Clark '14, Nick Diamantoni '15 and Trotman '15 dropped a half second off their season best to place second.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT kept the pressure on with a 1-2-5-6 finish in the 1500. Kyle Hannon '13 led the way with a 3:55.74, followed immediately by Ben Mattocks '12 running a four second PR in 3:56.31. Jay McKenna '13 dropped his own PR of 3:59.33 on his opponents for fifth place and Justin Bullock '14 had a tough day, finishing sixth in 4:01.07.
    
    
                  
    
    Brian Djaja '13 and Brendan Ensor '12 added some much needed early points in the 110HH. Djaja was third in 15.83 and Ensor ran a PR of 16.39 for fifth.
    
    
                  
    
    The next big event for Tech was the 800. Seeded 1-2-3, MIT did exactly that. Sam Parker '15 took the pace out, leading the way through the 400 in a slow 58. Parker was closely followed by teammate Gil O'Neil '13 with Pat Marx '13 hanging out in fifth. With 150 meters to go, Marx made his move, passing his teammates on the home stretch to give MIT the sweep in 1:56.52, 1:56.83 and 1:57.24.
    
    
                  
    
    Supporting Trotman in the jumps, Jackson Wirekoh '13 jumped a monster PR of 21' in the Long Jump for third place and added a triple jump of nearly 45' for second place. John Thomas '15 and Matt Falk '12 added a sixth and seventh in the High Jump and Nathan Peterson '12 and Colin Hong '15 earned first and third in the Pole Vault.
    
    
                  
    
    CK Umachi '12 took care of business in the throws, winning both the Hammer and Discus Throws. In the Hammer, Umachi threw 164' and in the Discus he threw 153'. Although not his specialty, Umachi added a fifth place in the Shot Put. Freshmen Cameron Wagar and Harry Rein went 1-2 in the Javelin throw at 176' and 172' respectively. Rein's 172' was a personal best.
    
    
                  
    
    With the meet locked up, the 5K runners were given a choice whether they wanted to race or not. Dan Harper '12, Roy Wedge '14 and Benji Xie '15 elected to race, but were instructed if they race they would have to not take the lead and to not push too hard, saving their best for next week in the New England Division III Championship. Harper went with the leader, who after the 800 in 2:20 decided he wanted Harper to share pacing duties. Harper, following directions, was staying behind as the pace slowed dramatically to 74 seconds per quarter and eventually 78 seconds before Harper was given the green light after 3600 meters. The next 1200 was a comfortable 3:29 as Harper pulled away easily for the victory in 15:05.01. Wedge and Xie claimed third and fourth in 15:23.03 and 15:24.22.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were a little low on depth due to keeping Jackie Brew '14  to just the 4x100 Relay and the Long Jump, the absence of Veronica Szklarzewski '15 in the jumps, Maggie Lloyd '12 in the Steeplechase, Kristine Bunker '14 in the High Jump, Jackie Konopka '14 in many events and Maddie Bairey '15 in the long sprints. Those competing were asked to get the job done and not worry about who was not competing.
    
    
                  
    
    The ladies did just that. As usual, Portia Jones led the way. First she anchored a 4x100 team of Brew, Martha Gross '12 and Jamie Simmons '12 to a season best 47.84 victory, good for 10th in the nation. She added a first in the 100 in 12.44 and first in the 200 in 25.30 and a second in the 100HH in 14.53. 
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons '12 was not her usual self, but still managed a come from behind victory in the 400IH in 63.09 and a second place in the 400 in 57.33. She also led off the 4x400 with a strong 57.5 to set up Gross, Cindy Huang '15 and Jones to run a 3:58.49. In the 400 Gross added support with a fifth place 59.09 and Martina de Geus '14 came back from winning the 3000 Steeplechase in 11:26.55 to add a sixth place in the 400IH in 70.04. Helping de Geus out in the Steeple were Claire O'Connell in second in 11:39.13 and Alexandra Taylor in fourth in 11:54.23 despite still recovering from a cold.
    
    
                  
    
    Prior to the 4x400, Huang took first place honors in the 800 in a strategic sit and kick, 2:19.08. She came through a slow 70 second first quarter and then unleashed a vicious kick in the final 200 to easily pull away. Brooke Johnson '13 and Louise van den Heuvel '14 had to run in the slower section due to not having a time this season, but managed to place fourth and fifth overall in 2:21.74 and 2:22.01. Taylor came back from the Steeple to place eighth.
    
    
                  
    
    Earlier in the meet, Johnson was involved in a very strategic 1500 where the pace was 79, 78, 73 and a final 300 in 44 for a 4:44.77 second place. Elaine McVay '15 dropped down from the distance events to place third in a surprising 4:46.78. Distance mate, Dacie Manion '15 added a fifth in 4:49.45 and van den Heuvel was sixth in 4:50.93.
    
    
                  
    
    Although not a victory, Kaitlyn Allen '14, running her first race ever for MIT, showed her talent, as she place third in the 10K in 39:50.77
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, MIT had two victories. Tilly Taylor '15 continued her undefeated season with a 135' throw for first place in the Javelin. Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 surprised everyone with a first place in the High Jump, clearing 5' 3".
    
    
                  
    
    Michelle Johnson '15 added a 36' second place in the Triple Jump. Christine Labaza '14 threw 115' again to earn filth place in the Discus Throw. Ashley Wheeler '15 threw an impressive 136' in the Hammer Throw to earn a surprising fifth place. The Pole Vaulters came through as usual, with Lauren Kuntz '13 leading the way with a 11-6 second place, followed by Marissa Engle '15 in third, Joanna Chen '15 in fourth and Kate Wymbs '14 in eighth.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT turns its attention to the New England Division III Championship, which will be hosted by MIT. Last year the women won the meet in the final event while the men finished second in a very close meet.

    DISTANCE RUNNERS SHINE
    
    
                  
    
    March 24, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    A small handful of distance runners kicked off the 2012 MIT Outdoor season at the Northeastern University Spring Open at their Solomon Track in Dedham. There are not many opportunities to run fast 10K's in favorable weather conditions for distance running, and this early season meet tends to have temperatures in the upper 40's to low 50's and is generally overcast--perfect conditions!
    
    
                  
    
    Dan Harper '12 and Roy Wedge '14 went into the race with the intention of making the pedestrian New England Division III standard of 33:40 and possibly the NEICAAA standard of 32:40.24. The first 400 was 71 and Harper was right with the leader while Wedge said no way and decided to stick with 76 for his first lap, hanging with the second pack already vying for third place. Harper continued to run with Brad Mish of the Boston Athletic Association, who was setting a crisp pace, coming through the mile in 4:53, the two mile in 9:50 and the three mile in 14:48. At this point Harper took the lead after Mish had run a couple of 75 second quarters, picking the pace back up to 74. They came through the four mile in 19:46 and Harper slowly began to pick up the pace, moving to 73 pace at the end of mile five for a 24:42. He tried to drop Mish but was unable to do so even after a mile of 72's, hitting the six mile in 29:31. A final lap of 65 finally allowed Harper to pull away for the win and personal best by a minute in 30:37.38, a time that may be good enough to make the top 20 times in Division III, which would qualify him for the NCAA Division III Championship.
    
    
                  
    
    Wedge, for his part, had a solid battle for fourth place, outlasting his opponent in 32:21.39, qualifying for the above mentioned championships as well as the ECAC Division III Championship. Wedge kept the pace at 5:11 per mile throughout the race.
    
    
                  
    
    Dacie Manion '15 was also in the race as the meet combined the men and women in this race, the only running event  the NCAA allows qualifying times when the genders are combined. Manion, running her first 10K, wanted to run 6:00 miles and did a remarkable job of doing so, hitting mile splits of 5:56, 5:59, 5:59, 6:03, 6:03 and 6:09 as she thought she was fatiguing at the end. However, she ran an 83 final 400 to show she actually had quite a lot left. Manion placed fourth in 37:33.47, missing the freshman record by 17 seconds.
    
    
                  
    
    A few of the steeplechasers and milers needed to get a NEDIII 5K qualifying time in since they get few if any opportunities to do so. Stephen Serene '12, Justin Bullock '14 and Maggie Lloyd '12 were MIT's representatives.
    
    
                  
    
    Serene and Bullock needed a 15:30 performance and were well on their way, running 4:55 and 4:56 for the first two miles. At this point, Serene kept up the pace, running another 4:54 while Bullock gave in to the pain for a couple of laps, slowing to a 5:08 third mile. Bullock, like Manion, realized he had too much left, finishing with a 34 final 200 to just miss the qualifying mark with 15:34.72. Serene was able to finish strong, placing fourth in 15:18.05.
    
    
                  
    
    Lloyd did not fair so well. She started out in front, running a solid pace of 88 second quarters to hit the first mile in 5:53. As the two leaders kept up that pace, Lloyd did not feel she had it on this day, slowing to 90 second pace for the second mile and then a 6:09 for the third mile. However, her 18:47.06 was safely under the 18:56.48 qualifying standard for NEDIII.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT travels with a little less than half the team to Westmont College in Santa Barbara, CA for their Spring Break Meet on March 31, finishing a good week of training in the warm California climate.

    TRACK & FIELD SHINES AT SPRING INVITE, LARRY ELLIS MEETS
    
    
                  
    
    NUMEROUS PERSONAL BESTS ACHIEVED AS TEAM PREPARES FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS
    
    
                  
    
    April 22, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    MIT hosted their Spring Invitational on Saturday, playing host to 13 other teams under sunny 75 degree skies with fairly strong wind conditions. However, the day before, a handful of Tech runners made the trip to Princeton to run in the Larry Ellis Memorial Distance Festival. Kyle Hannon '13 led the way with an NCAA qualifying time, running a 1500 PR of 3:50.73, a mark sure to get him to the National Championship. Stephen Serene '12 also ran a personal best, his in the 3000 Steeplechase. Although he seemed to lose focus and fall off after the mile mark, he recovered to finish in 9:20.32. Maintaining his focus would get him a spot at the NCAA's in May. Sam Parker '15 continued his excellent freshman year, racing the 800 and finishing in 1:54.00. The lone representative for the women was freshman Elaine McVay. She went out in 80 for the first 400 and then settled into 82 second pace until the final lap of the first 3200 meters. At this point she slowed to 84 pace and one disastrous 89 lap before rallying to finish in a new personal best and lowering her own Freshman Record to 17:15.42, a mark that may get her to Nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    Back at the MIT track, Dan Harper '12 was going to try to improve his 10K time, hoping to move up on the NCAA list and solidify a place in the NCAA Championship. He had early morning 65 degree temperatures, but a challenging wind to deal with. With the help of Brad Mish of the BAA, the pace was constant and right on target, running 73 seconds per lap as they traded off the first three miles. The three mile split was 14:40, having slowed to 74's in the third mile. The fourth mile was back on pace but Harper was on his own as Mish could not hold the pace. His fifth mile was 4:53 and the sixth a 4:55 as fatigue was obviously setting in. His final 400 was uncharacteristically slow for Harper. However, running 71 seconds showed he still had something in the tank. His 30:30.57 moved him to number 14 on the NCAA Division III list with a month to go to qualify.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500, both Kali Benavides '15 and Jay McKenna '14 ran personal bests. Benavides ran splits of 78, 80 and 83 before closing well to finish in 4:58.56. McKenna took the lead at the start despite the tough wind conditions. This led to a faster pace, but he definitely was set up for the kill by those drafting off him. Even after being passed he did not give up, fighting for every place, finishing in 4:02.88.
    
    
                  
    
    In the High Hurdles, Brian Djaja '13 got tough, shook off his doubts about his hamstring and competed well. Although the rust was definitely there he still ran a season best of 15.87. Portia Jones '12, got off to a good start and was very aggressive, but she over-rotated her lead arm coming back, throwing her off balance enough to slow her time. Nevertheless she won in 14.76.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 400, Maddie Bairey '15 returned from her quad injury, joining recently returned Martha Gross '12. Gross won the event in a well run 59.22 and Bairey ran a very competitive 60.56. On the men's side DJ Ronde '13 ran an excellent PR of 50.63.
    
    
                  
    
    The 800 was one of the best events for MIT. For the women, Cindy Huang '15 and Alexandra Taylor '14 placed second and third. Huang set the freshman record for the third consecutive week, this time running a complete 800, but still learning how to relax when trying to kick while fatigued. Her 2:16.47 led Taylor to the line in 2:16.60, a huge personal best for the sophomore. Pat Marx '13 returned to competition for the first time since indoor nationals. Even though he is not in the best condition, the competitive spirit was certainly there. He went out in 56 for the 400, moved up well entering the second lap, and finished with a very strong final 100 to win in 1:54.24.
    
    
                  
    
    The next event, the 400IH, was an excellent one for the women. Jamie Simmons '12 and Portia Jones '12 placed 1-2 in the race, running 61.89 and 62.12 respectively. Both got out well with Jones leading the entire race until the final 80 meters. Both pushed with all they had but Simmons just won out. They are currently ranked 2-3 on the NCAA Division III list.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events the good performances kept on coming. Nathan Peterson '12 was able to compete in the Pole Vault for the first time since the Indoor NCAA Division III Championship. His ankle still not 100% from the sprain that took place in late March, Peterson only used a four step approach, but still cleared 14-9. Also in the vault, Yida Gao '14 and Colin Hong '15 set season bests of 14-3 1/4. For the women, Lauren Kuntz '13 won the event in a jump-off at 12-1 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    Sheldon Trotman '15 joined those competing for the first time outdoors this season. In the Long Jump, Trotman leaped 20-7 3/4. In the Triple Jump, Trotman went 43-7 1/4 to get second behind teammate Jackson Wirekoh '14, who also just returned from injury. Wirekoh jumped 45-1 3/4 to win the event. Trotman also jumped 6-1 1/4 in the High Jump, anchored the 4x100 relay and ran a 11.37 100.
    
    
                  
    
    Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 improved her own freshman record in the High Jump to 5' 3.
    
    
                  
    
    In the throws, Cameron Wagar '15 and Tilly Taylor '15 both won their respective Javelin competitions. Wagar threw 187-5 and Taylor 139-9. CK Umachi '12 won the Hammer with a 176-0 throw, and added a personal best in the Discus with a 158-1 performance. Christine Labaza '14 had a great meet, throwing personal bests of 115-1 in the Discus and 36-0 in the Shot Put. Ellen Liverpool '15 threw a personal best of 125-6 in the Hammer and Ashley Wheeler threw personal bests in the Discus of 93-3, and the Javelin in 93-3.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week begins a five week series of championships. First on the list is the NEWMAC Championship at Smith College. The MIT women are favored to win the title for the fourth time in succession while the men are seeded second to Springfield College although MIT has won the meet every year since 2001.

    DESPITE DEPLETED SQUAD, MEN AND WOMEN WIN WESTMONT INVITE
    
    
                  
    
    March 31, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    MIT Track & Field enjoyed their Spring Trip to California where the warm weather permitted excellent training for the Engineers. The final day of the trip, Tech drove from Claremont to Santa Barbara to compete at Westmont College in the Westmont Invitational. The Engineers brought 40 athletes on the trip, 20 men and 20 women, approximately 40% of the total squad. Despite the fact that only 16 men and 19 women competed, and many of those athletes were pulled from additional events due to injuries or to prevent injuries, MIT still managed to win the meet. The men scored 69 points to 68.5 for host Westmont in the eight team field. The women scored 84.66 points to outlast the 78.5 points for Fresno Pacific.
    
    
                  
    
    There were not a lot of outstanding performances in the meet. Perhaps the 60 degree temperatures and eventual rain had something to do with it, or maybe the Engineers were just not ready to compete. From a team perspective it was a dismal day despite the victory.
    
    
                  
    
    One of the few bright spots for the men was CK Umachi '12. Umachi won the Hammer with a throw of 166-07, won the Discus in the rain at 137-03 and took fourth place honors in the Shot Put at 44-00 1/2. Altogether he scored 17 points in the 7-5-4-3-2-1 scoring format. Running well for MIT were Dan Harper '12 in the 5K and Stephen Serene '12 in the 3000 Steeplechase. Harper was all alone from the gun, controlling the race from the front to run 15:10.08, and this was after running the 1500 in 4:08.14. Serene was the lone competitor in the Steeple, but nevertheless ran a competitive time of 9:33.25.
    
    
                  
    
    For the women, Jackie Brew '14 was the high point scorer, although a few more of the women performed well. Brew earned third in the Long Jump at 17-03 1/2, third in the 100HH in 15.1 (hand time due to camera failure), fourth in the Triple Jump at 34-09 3/4, sixth in the 100 with a 12.75 clocking and led off the victorious 48.32 4x100 Relay. Brew accounted for 13 3/4 points for Tech. Also performing well was Portia Jones '12, who appeared to have won the 100HH, but without a picture to back it up, was awarded second place in 14.8. Jones also placed third in the 400IH in 63.48 and had a superb anchor leg in the 4x100 to walk-down the leader and win by .01 seconds. Michelle Johnson '15 won the Triple Jump with a 35-09 1/2 effort and Lauren Kuntz '13 won the Pole Vault at 12-01 1/2. Jamie Simmons '12 ran an excellent third leg in the 4x100 after having to start over from a near dead stop due to the fact she had to wait on her teammate Maddie Bairey '15, who was having severe breathing difficulties due to allergies. Simmons had a busy and fatiguing day as she came back to win the 400 in 57.56 and then secure a fifth place in the 400IH with a 65.05. The final victory for the women, which was actually in the first event, was earned by Maggie Lloyd '12 in the 3000 Steeplechase. Lloyd ran a controlled 11:29.10 to easily lead a 1-2-3 sweep by MIT. Lloyd came back in the 800 to place fifth in 2:22.32, showing a very competitive spirit.
    
    
                  
    
    Although they did not win an event, nor run spectacular times, both Tyler Singer-Clark '14 and Justin Bullock '14 competed very well. Singer-Clark placed third in the 200 in 22.29, fourth in the 400 in 49.13 and ran an excellent second leg on the 4x100 Relay that earned second in 43.03. Bullock placed second in the 1500 after seemingly giving up early in the race, running 4:01.28, and again came from way behind in the 800 to place fifth in 1:58.93.
    
    
                  
    
    Although it is very early in the season, Tech Track & Field needs to regain the spirit that has made them a National level team. Having the entire team together for the first  meet on April 7 against RPI and WPI will be a good measuring stick to test the competitiveness of both the men's and women's teams.
