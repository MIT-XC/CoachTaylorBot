              <p><span class="headline">MEN FOLLOW SINGER-CLARK, HARPER AND UMACHI TO DIVISION III TITLE, WOMEN TAKE SECOND</span></p>
              <p align="left">May 3-5, 2012</p>
              <p align="left">The MIT Men's Track &amp; Field team finally broke through for the team title in the <a href="ned3.res.php">New England Division III Championship</a> after four straight years of being the bride's maid, the last two years single digit losses. Some extraordinary performances propelled Tech to the victory with 113 points on their home track, finishing 15.5 points ahead of second place Williams College. The women's team could not make up for the points lost to injuries, finishing second with 124 points to Williams College.</p>
              <p align="left">The men began day three with a slight lead over favored Bates College and the always tough Ephs of Williams. On Friday, the second day of the Championship, Dan Harper '12 in a season long quest to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championships, having already run 30:37 and 30:30 earlier in the season, performances that any other year would go to the NCAA Championship, but this year would not. Beginning the day ranked 25th in the country for Division III, Harper took to the track in yet another effort to lower his time, but also to bring MIT a victory. Doing all the work by himself once it was apparent no one wanted to help out after an initial 76 second 400, Harper ripped 72-73 second 400's the rest of the way. Harper hit 1600 splits of 4:54, 4:52, 4:53, 4:55, 4:54 and 4:46 before finishing with a 66 last 400 to run 30:20.42, finishing 1:05 ahead of second place and moving to 18th on the NCAA list. Also running amazing races for MIT were Roy Wedge '14 finishing fifth in a PR of 31:30.87, Benji Xie '15 finishing  sixth in a PR of 31:34.91 as well as non-scorers Matthew Jordan '15 in a PR of 32:05.33, Allen Leung '15 in a PR of 32:06.37 and Matt Weaver '12 running a PR in 33:09.27.</p>
              <p align="left">Also scoring points on day two was CK Umachi '12, who placed fourth in the Discus Throw with a mark of 152-10. In the Javelin Throw, freshmen Cameron Wagar and Harry Rein earned sixth and eighth places with marks of 179-11 and 175-6 respectively. Rein's mark was a personal best.</p>
              <p align="left">So, entering day three MIT knew they did not have much room for error, but as in any meet poor performances happened. Fortunately for MIT, true in any championship team, when someone did not get the job done, someone else stepped up and took over the responsibility. In the first final on the track, the 3000 Steeplechase, Stephen Serene '12, Eric Safai '14 and Logan Trimble '13 tried to bring MIT some points. Serene was seeded fourth at 9:20, but when the leaders took it out aggressively he did not go with them. Safai, not seeded to score, was probably being too competitive, throwing caution to the wind and went right with them, hitting the 1600 in 4:47. At that point Safai started the long, painful death unique to this race, but never gave up. Serene rallied at the end to finish sixth in 9:22.39 and Safai hung on for a monstrous PR of 9:25.21, good for seventh. Trimble also ran a personal best, 9:41.76, but did not score.</p>
              <p align="left">Next up, in the 4x100 relay, Mike DuPlessis '14, Tyler Singer-Clark '14, Nick Diamantoni '15 and Sheldon Trotman '15 took the third seeded Engineers to a second place finish in 42.65 despite a poor third handoff due to Trotman leaving a hair too early.</p>
              <p align="left">The 1500 was next and MIT was expecting some big points. Number one seed Kyle Hannon '13 never got into the race, falling to the back of the pack and never moving up. However, Ben Mattocks '12 ran another superb race. Last week, Mattocks ran a four second personal best at the NEWMAC Championship. Mattocks did not think, just competed, going through splits of 64, 2:05 and 3:07 before finishing in sixth in 3:53.35. Justin Bullock '14, running from the slower section, won his section in a personal best of 3:55.41 to finish in eighth overall.</p>
              <p align="left">Meanwhile, Umachi was delivering again, this time taking second in the Hammer Throw with a personal best of 186-1, moving him to number 11 on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p align="left">In the Pole Vault, Nathan Peterson '12 came through once again, this time winning with a 15-11 jump. Also scoring for Tech was Yida Gao '13, who cleared 14-5 1/4.</p>
              <p align="left">Back on the track, Singer-Clark, Diamantoni and DJ Ronde '13 were set to represent MIT in the 400 Meter Dash. Singer-Clark, seeded fourth, obviously did not see the seed list, because he ran an outstanding race, easily pulling away from the field in the final 100 to run 48.55 for the victory. Also running PR's, but not scoring, Diamantoni ran 50.39 and Ronde ran 50.42.</p>
              <p align="left">Perhaps the biggest surprise in the meet for MIT was what DuPlessis did in the 100. Seeded 11th and only practicing for two weeks after coming back from injury, DuPlessis first made the 100 final by running 11.28 in the trials, then dropped an 11.09 bomb to steal third place, giving MIT six big points.</p>
              <p align="left">The hits kept on coming for the Engineers as Pat Marx '13 and Sam Parker '15 delivered in the 800. Certainly the deepest and highest quality field in the meet with 14 runners listed under 1:55, Marx and Parker were both in the fast section and hoping for a fast start. In the slower section, led by the defending national champion Ben Sheetz of Amherst, winning in 1:52.02, four finished under 1:53. In the fast section, Marx made a bid to win a little late, but still finished in third in a personal best 1:51.80 and Parker ran a best of 1:53.57, but finished in ninth to just miss scoring.</p>
              <p align="left">Singer-Clark brought the magic back in the 200, lighting the track up with a 21.67 victory, another huge personal best and another 10 points for MIT.</p>
              <p align="left">Going into the 5K, it was clear this event would decide the meet. In the past two years, Williams scored big points in the 5K to seal the team victory. With a 12 point lead for MIT going into the event and with Williams having the first and sixth seeds, Harper knew MIT's hopes rested on his shoulders. The pace was very fast right from the start. By the mile mark Harper was up with the leaders at 4:45. Wedge, Serene and Xie were also coming back from tough races and were in the thick of this one at 4:46. At the 3200 mark Harper was still there at 9:31. Wedge had fallen back a bit but was hanging tough at 9:33. Serene was back at 9:36 while Xie had to stop due to cramps. Although he fell off the leaders in the final mile due to a sharp increase in pace, Harper rallied with a 69 last lap and a 31 final 200 to place third in a huge PR of 14:42.97. Williams' runners ran well with three under 15:00, but none scored, locking up the meet for MIT as long as they scored at least two points in the two remaining relays and only then if Williams were to win both the 4x400 and 4x800 relays. Wedge did not score but ran a PR of 14:58.67. Serene also ran a personal best, his in 15:02.83.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 4x800, Gil O'Neil ran a superb leadoff of 1:56.7 to put MIT among the three leading teams. Bullock dropped a 1:54.6 to put MIT in the lead. Jared Forman '13 ran 1:57.5 to put Tech in third going into the final leg. Parker took over the anchor duties, but had the wrong frame of mind. Instead of going for the victory he protected third place, only running 1:58.2, giving MIT a 7:47.04 third place.</p>
              <p align="left">Singer-Clark led off the 4x400, but knowing MIT had won the meet probably took some of the adrenalin out of him as he only ran 49.5. Diamantoni, who has had problems running faster in the relay than in the open race, was only able to run 50.8. John Thomas '15 ran a solid 50.5 and Marx anchored MIT to third place in 49.1 and an overall time of 3:20.22.</p>
              <p align="left">The women, defending New England Division III Outdoor Track &amp; Field champions and winners  two of the last three years, were thirty point underdogs going into this year's championship, primarily due to  injuries, which kept key performers such as Brooke Johnson '13, Kristine Bunker '14, Jackie Konopka '14, Veronica Szklarzewski '15 out of the meet, and others such as Jackie Brew '14 limited to what they would be able to do.</p>
              <p align="left">On Friday night, freshman super runner, Elaine McVay '15, using her 5K time to get her into the 10K field, ran with the leaders through a perfect pace of 86 and 87 second quarters. The three in the lead group hit 1600 splits of 5:51, 5:48, 5:46, 5:51, 5:50 and 5:46. McVay took over in the final six laps, opening up a small gap before closing the victory with an 82 last 400 to finish in 36:14.88. McVay is now ranked 13th on the NCAA list. Tania Morimoto '12, who had been suffering from a foot problem for most of the season, went with the leaders. She was able to hold on through 3600 meters, but then fell off the pace. She was able to hold onto seventh place in 38:30.85. Kaitlyn Allen '14, running her second 10K in two weeks, lowered her PR by nearly a minute, closing her season out with a 39:09.33, missing on scoring by one place. Dacie Manion '15, one of the top seeds in the race, was unable to finish.</p>
              <p align="left">Also on Friday, Jackie Brew '14 put her ailing hip flexor to the test in the Long Jump. Without being able to practice for three weeks and having an inhibited range of motion, she was only able to jump 17-2, good for seventh place.</p>
              <p align="left">Going into Saturday, MIT was already pretty far behind Williams College, which had scored 24 points to MIT's 14. Going into the Steeplechase, MIT was seeded seventh and eighth, but all three entries were capable of pulling off a big surprise. Martina de Geus '14, was afraid to go with the leaders and their ambitious pace, so she settled to run instead of race. She eventually pushed the end to finish in seventh in a season best 11:09.02. Claire O'Connell '14, still new to the race, had a lot of problems with the barriers, usually stuttering up to them and then further decelerating due to being too close to hurdle it well. Nevertheless she missed placing by 12 seconds as she ran a PR of 11:26.39. </p>
              <p align="left">In the 4x100, the quartet of Brew, Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12 and Portia Jones '12 ran a season best of 47.48 to place second. The handoffs were crisp but the first two could be a little deeper in the zone, perhaps giving MIT the opportunity to get under 47 seconds. They are currently ranked 11th on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 1500, Johnson gave it a try and even though the fast pace of 2:25 for the first 800 seemed easy, her IT Band was too painful to finish the race. Louise van den Heuvel '14 ran a season best of 4:45.14, but it was not fast enough to score.</p>
              <p align="left">Jones and Brew were in the 100HH final and took advantage of the opportunity. Jones won going away in a season best of 14.34. Brew, in fourth place going into the final hurdle, hit the hurdle with her lead foot, nearly falling, but staying up to take seventh in 15.10.</p>
              <p align="left">In the field, Tilly Taylor '15 remained undefeated, winning the Javelin with a throw of 138-7. Also in the field events, fellow freshmen, Preethi Vaidyanathan and Michelle Johnson, scored in their respective events, the High Jump and Triple Jump. Vaidyanathan placed third with a jump of 5' 3&quot; and Johnson jumped 35-9 1/2 to place sixth.</p>
              <p align="left">Simmons and Gross scored big for MIT in the 400, both running season bests. Simmons ran 56.51 for a close second place while Gross ran 58.67 for a surprise and much needed fifth.</p>
              <p align="left">Jones was back again, this time in the 100. Running a season best of 12.27, Jones placed second, finishing behind Briana Wise of Worcester State, the same person she almost walked down in the 4x100 Relay.</p>
              <p align="left">Alexandra Taylor '14 continued to race well in the 800. Going with the leaders, who ran 63 for the first 400, she fatigued along with the others, but held on well enough to earn fifth place in a new personal best of 2:15.58. Cindy Huang '15 was unable to hang on after the fast first 400, finishing in 2:19.12.</p>
              <p align="left">Simmons was back on the track in the 400IH. With less than an hour after such a quality performance, it was understandable that Simmons got out a little slower than usual. However, when she got around the first turn she realized she was very far behind. Moving hard on the backstretch, she made up a lot of ground but ran out of track as she finished in 61.92 for third place.</p>
              <p align="left">Jones, on the track one more time in an individual event, again finished second, this time in the 200. Jones ran a season best of 24.98, again finishing behind Wise of Worcester State. Gross supported with a sixth place season best of 25.79.</p>
              <p align="left">As the Shot Put and Pole Vault were finishing, it was unclear how Williams was doing in both events, and whether MIT would get 19, 17 or 15 points in the vault. Because MIT and Williams were close enough that MIT might be able to pull out the victory in the relays, McVay was back on the track in the 5K. The pace was not a great deal faster than the 10K the night before, but 83 pace for the first mile was plenty as the leaders came through in 5:29. The second mile slowed to a 5:37, which was fine with McVay. In the final mile she tried to pull away but there was not enough there. She held on for third in 17:26.37, just 11 seconds off her PR.</p>
              <p align="left">As the women were starting their 4x800, it was learned Lauren Kuntz '13 had placed second in the Pole Vault at 12-1 1/2 to get second place in a jump-off. Joanna Chen '15 got a fifth place in a personal best of 11-1 3/4. Kate Wymbs '14 also jumped a personal best, good for sixth place at 10-8. Marissa Engle '14 placed seventh, also at 10-8.</p>
              <p align="left">This made it impossible to catch Williams, so the 4x400 team was scratched since Jones and Simmons had such a full day and Brew was hurting from her injured hip flexor. Nevertheless, the 4x800 was on the track and hoping to win their event. Taylor led off, going out in 65 and finishing in 2:16.4 to put MIT in the lead. van den Heuvel took over the baton duties, but did not take control of the race, only going out in 69 and then getting left behind a bit in 2:20.8. Margaret Coad '15 was responsible for the third leg and did a great job of competing, staying with the leaders until the final 200 and finishing in 2:19.5. Huang anchored the relay, and even though she went out in 65 was unable to close the gap significantly. She faded on the final lap, ending in 2:18.0 for an overall time of 9:14.89, good for third place.</p>
              <p align="left">Next week, MIT hosts the NEICAAA Championship, which is the All Division New England Championship, pitting all Division I, II and III team against each other.</p>
