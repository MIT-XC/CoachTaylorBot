    ### McPhillips and Trautner Add Their Names to the NCAA Championship List

    The NCAA permits one Final Qualifying meet per region and MIT again hosted the New England region Final Qualifier.  For the oval runners the weather was perfect with mid-70 degree temperatures, low humidity and no wind.  Of course, the sprinters and jumpers were not too happy with no tail wind.  The qualifying standards were steep so there was no more than one section or flight in any event.
    
    
                  
    
    The performance of the meet for the Engineers was turned in by Marissa McPhillips '20 in the 1500.  With a loaded field, Katie Bacher '20, who had already qualified for Nationals in the 1500, led the field through a 2:24 first 800.  McPhillips stayed towards the front of the pack through a 3:36 1200.  In the homestretch she held onto that pace, finishing second in a huge PR of 4:31.09, easily making the NCAA field.
    
    
                  
    
    Almost equal to that was the 800 race.  With even a more stacked field, Bailey Tregoning '19 and Margaret Trautner '20 were trying to improve their mark and chances of getting into the NCAA Championship.  Tregoning already had a solid 2:11.18, but Trautner was a few spots out with a 2:13.39.  Sydney Packard '20 from WPI set a quick pace of 62 for the 400 and 1:35 for the 600.  Tregoning took the lead at that point but faded a bit in the homestretch, but still winning in 2:11.80.  Trautner was running great, but was passed by two right at the finish, taking sixth place in 2:12.65.  A mark that earned her a trip to Nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    Nneoma Okonkwo '18 gave the Long Jump her best shot, improving her season best to 18-8 to win the event, but she was one person away from making the NCAA field.
    
    
                  
    
    Ariela Slutsky '18 improved her season best in the Discus, winning with a throw of 149-3.  Slutsky also won the Hammer with a 170-3 performance.  She will represent MIT in both events at the National Championship.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Pole Vault, Jacqueline Ahrens '21 and Kari Stromhaug '19 finished first and second with vaults of 12-2 and 11-8.  Although neither jumped season bests, both will compete in the Pole Vault at Nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    Jason Villanueva '18 jumped a personal best 46-0 1/2 in the Triple Jump, but it was not enough to make the NCAA field.
    
    
                  
    
    Jon Fakkema '19 threw a season best in the Hammer, throwing 166-11, but this also was not enough to make the National field.
    
    
                  
    
    In an impressive effort, Chris Washington '20 made three excellent attempts at 6-9 3/4, just hitting the bar with his legs on the final attempt,  failing to clear.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT will take six men and 10 women to the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field Championship.

    ### Eccles Leads Engineers With 10K Victory  
    
                      
    
    
                    
                      
    
    April 20, 2018 
    
    
                      
    
    Four years ago when the nonrecruited Mary Eccles '18 asked about trying out for the Cross Country and Track & Field teams, no one could have predicted the runner she would become.  Her freshman year it was astounding that she placed in the New England Division III Championship and ran PR's of 17:59.99 and 37:32.10.  She continued to improve each year, winning the 10K at the NED3 Championship and following that up with the 5K victory indoors this year.  Earning her first All America honor this past indoor season in the 5K Eccles is continuing to write her legacy every weekend in this her senior year. 
    
    
                      
    
    At the Princeton University Larry Ellis Memorial Track and Field Invitational Eccles toed the line with seven other runners for the 10K just before 10 p.m. with the temperature a frigid 41 degrees.  She burst off the line, separated herself from the pack immediately and settled in for 85 second 400's.  After a 5:42 first 1600, Eccles dropped her pace slightly to a 5:41 and then a 5:39 on her third 1600.  After the fourth 1600 in 5:40 she was in sight of lapping the field and used that for further motivation.  She continued the 5:40 pace, lapping the field and finishing with a 39 second personal best of 35:27.11, number two on the MIT all-time list and number seven on the NCAA Division III performance list this season. 
    
    
                      
    
    Six other MIT athletes competed at the Princeton meet.  Prior to the 10K not only was the temperature in the 40's, but the wind was pushing 15-20 mph, slowly dying down late in the evening.  Before the wind died down, Jenna Melanson '20 competed in the 3,000 Meter Steeplechase.  She got out a little too fast in 81 seconds for the first lap, and after another lap, she started paying for the early pace.  Her pace started creeping up to 86, 87, 88 and finally a 92 second lap before finishing in 10:54.33, a very respectable time, currently number 12 on the NCAA list.
    
    
                      
    
    In the 1500, Katie Bacher '20 and Marissa McPhillips '20 also braved the cold and wind.  Bacher was pulled out in 72, working with a group who were running the exact pace the sophomore was looking for.  She ran out of gas a little at the end, but produced a season best 4:38.23.  McPhillips was pulled out a little too fast in her section, splitting 70 for the initial 400.  She too fatigued a lot in the final lap running 4:38.85.
    
    
                      
    
    Prior to the 1500, McPhillips and Katie Williams '21 raced in the 800 Meter event.  Williams was pulled out to a very quick 64.4, and even though she lost a little in the end, she ran a solid 2:15.00.  McPhillips went out a little slower in her section and finished in 2:16.50.
    
    
                      
    
    Only two men made the trip for MIT, Aidan Gilson '19 in the Steeplechase and Josh Rosenkranz '19 in the 5K.  Gilson, struggling to find his racing groove after a fabulous indoor season and then dealing with a sickness as he began his outdoor season, was hoping to right the ship in this race.  Based on his 9:05 performance last year, he was seeded in the fast section.  The initial 400 in 68 was enough to shake his already vulnerable confidence.  The junior dropped towards the back as the race progressed, running 9:35.62.
    
    
                      
    
    Rosenkranz ran an excellent race, moving when he needed to in order to close gaps, coming through 1600 splits of 4:39 and 4:45.  When he needed to make his final move to keep up with the breakaway group he was unable to respond.  Low mileage and still building his fitness from an early season setback, showed as he is still building his strength.  Nevertheless he finished in a solid 14:51.99.
    
    
                  
    
    Next Saturday the teams will try to defend their NEWMAC Conference titles at Springfield College.  The men have not lost the title since 2000 and the women have every championship since 2009.

    ### Shaoul Sets MIT Triple Jump Record, MIT Brings Home Seven All America Awards
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 24-26, 2018              
    
    
                  
    
    MIT brought 10 women and six men to the the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field Championship, held at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse, with hopes of making it into the top 10 on the women's side and top 20 on the men's. To make it to this championship a student-athlete had to be ranked among the top 22 women / 20 men entered in their event.  Once here, only the top eight score and earn All America honors.  MIT's hopes for either team would need some surprise outcomes to come to fruition.
    
    
                  
    
    On day one, things did not start off in a manner that would help MIT's goal.  Mary Eccles '18 was the first to compete for the Engineers.  The 10K, Eccles event, was moved to 8:45 a.m. in order for the athletes to escape the extreme heat predicted for the original start time, which was three hours later.  Eccles started out great, and looked as though she was ready to move up from her ninth place seed and earn her second All America award.  However, after running back to back 5:49 miles, and just before the 4800 mark, Eccles pulled her parachute, putting in a 6:40+ mile.  This was not her day, but the senior ended a marvelous season and truly inspirational career with a 17th place finish in 38:16.03.
    
    
                  
    
    Cody Bratten '18 was up next, taking to the discus circle to try and put MIT on the scoreboard.  Bratten, also seeded ninth entering the competition, had three decent throws, but nothing at the level that would get him into finals (top nine).  He finished in 12th with a 156-7 performance.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's Pole Vault was starting at about the time the Discus was ending.  MIT had Jacqueline Ahrens '21 (seeded ninth) and Kari Stromhaug '19 (seeded 14th) in the competition.  Stromhaug has earned All America honors in each of her competitive seasons at MIT and Ahrens, just a freshman, was also All American in her first season.  The opening height was 11-5 3/4, which both cleared on their first attempt.  That height knocked out two competitors and another one never showed for the competition.  The next height 11-11 3/4 was cleared by both Stromhaug and Ahrens on their second attempt with six more vaulters not making the height.  At 12-3 1/2, Stromhaug cleared on her first attempt, but Ahrens needed three attempts.  This height claimed six more victims, leaving seven who cleared it and the defending national champion who had yet to enter the competition.  Stromhaug, the only one to have cleared 12-3 1/2 on her first attempt was winning the competition at that point.  However, two cleared the next height and neither were Stromhaug or Ahrens.  The defending national champion failed to make her opening height, giving Stromhaug third place and Ahrens a two-way tie for sixth.  MIT was on the board with eight and a half points.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's Discus was already underway and Ariela Slutsky '18, seeded 14th in the competition, was doing relatively well, having thrown 145-0 to finish second in the first flight.  With 11 throwing in each flight, and only nine going to finals, Slutsky would have to beat at least four in the seeded flight, which is exactly what happened.  The senior then improved to 145-5, but remained in ninth, not quite reaching All American as she did in 2017.
    
    
                  
    
    It was time to get onto the track again with the women's 1500.  MIT had both Marissa McPhillips '20 and Katie Bacher '20 in the field, seeded sixth and eighth respectively.  Both were in the second of two heats, with the top four in each and the next four fastest times moving on to the 12 person field final on Saturday.  The fifth place runner in the first heat finished in 4:37.15, so as long as McPhillips and Bacher were either top four in their heat or top eight and faster than 4:37.15, they would be in the final.  The initial pace of the second heat was slow with an opening 400 of 76 and 2:30 for the 800.  Things still did not pick up significantly, but McPhillips and Bacher moved up in the crowded field to gain better position.  With 300 to go McPhillips moved hard, catching the leaders with a final 400 of 70 to finish second in 4:36.74.  Bacher, moving a little behind McPhillips, struggled in the final 50, falling from fourth to sixth, .04 from seventh.  Her time of 4:37.63 was the final time to make it to the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up for MIT was the 400IH.  The men were up first with Chris Sweeney '18, seeded 18th, representing MIT in lane four of the first heat.  Sweeney got out well, struggled a bit on the fourth and fifth hurdles and took too long to recover.  He finished well, having a solid homestretch but was only able to finish fifth in his heat with a 54.22, good enough for 14th overall.
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen '18, making her fourth trip to the NCAA Championship in the 400IH, was seeded fifth entering the competition.  The senior was able to win her heat despite hitting some hurdles and stuttering badly on the homestretch, running 62.33 in the windy conditions.
    
    
                  
    
    The final events for MIT on day one were the men's and women's 3,000 Meter Steeplechase.  Jenna Melanson '20 was seeded eighth entering the competition and Aidan Gilson 12th.  Gilson put himself in excellent position early in the trial.  Even though the pace was slow (4:56 at the 1600), the pack was fairly spread out.  Gilson grew too comfortable with the margin of separation and lost enough of his competitiveness that he started losing a lot of ground.  With the top five in each heat and the next four fastest times advancing to the final, he was taking it a bit too casually.  Having fallen back to fifth, the junior made a burst with 200 to go to move into fourth in 9:24.05, making finals on Saturday.
    
    
                  
    
    The top seed was in Melanson's heat and she went out to the front with a strong start.  Melanson, closed that gap over the first quarter, running in second with a group of five who had separated themselves from the rest of the pack.  Nothing changed throughout the race and Melanson ran a very relaxed personal best of 10:41.37 to finish in a very close second, moving on to the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two was a very light day for the Engineers by comparison, but important in their quest to have a successful team finish.  Alec Reduker '20 was the first to compete for MIT, entered in the High Jump as the eighth seed.  Reduker had cleared 6-10 3/4 during the Spring Trip fresh off his All America performance at the Indoor NCAA Division III Championship.  However, he then suffered a lower back injury that put him out for a few weeks with no practice or competition and then a guarded approach to championship preparation.  The opening height was 6-4, which Reduker cleared with no problem.  He then cleared 6-6 on his first attempt.  However, at 6-8 he was unable to clear, ending his outdoor season.
    
    
                  
    
    Later in the evening, after a three hour lightning delay, Bailey Tregoning '19 and Margaret Trautner '20 prepared for the 800.  Tregoning, seeded ninth was in the first heat and Trautner, seeded 20th, was in the third heat.  Making the finals required finishing among the top two in each heat or to be one of the next three fastest times.  The first heat went out extremely fast, splitting the first 400 in 61.  Tregoning knew it was too fast and was comfortable at 63 about ten meters behind a group of four runners.  She ran a solid next 200, looking as if she might catch the group.  Briefly, but all too significant, Tregoning lost hope for about 100 meters, before reapplying herself and finishing well.  Her 2:11.88 was seventh in her heat, ruling out the possibility of making finals. The second heat was also fast with the third place runner running 2:09.79, which meant in order for Trautner to make finals she would have to be one of the top two in her heat or be third and run faster than 2:10.18.  Neither of those happened as Trautner only saw how fast everyone was running and lost hope.  Her heat went out really slow, splitting 66, so no one qualified on time from that heat.  Trautner finished 20th overall in 2:14.19.
    
    
                  
    
    Saturday, the final day of competition and one that would be in the mid-90's all day, started with the Steeplechase.  Gilson was up first for MIT.  The pace was absolutely pedestrian at 5:00 for the first mile.  At that point it picked up and Gilson did not respond to the increase in pace.  However, despite the slow early pace, many did not keep up.  Gilson faded from second to eighth, but fought for that final All America position and earned it in 9:16.04.
    
    
                  
    
    It was now Melanson's turn.  In complete contrast, the women's start was fast.  Melanson had made the decision to go out with the leaders, but a little bit off of them if it was too fast.  Well, they were very fast at 77 for the first quarter and she was 79, which was plenty fast enough.  This put her in limbo between the first two and the four who were the chase pack.  After 2K she started slowing from her 5:34 first mile and the chase pack caught her.  She too fought for eighth place and also held on, running another personal best of 10:41.30.
    
    
                  
    
    Next, McPhillips and Bacher were up in the 1500 final.  The pace was quick from the start, so even though both McPhillips and Bacher were being cautious in the back of the 12 person final, they still came through the 400 in 72 and the 800 in 2:25--fast for temperatures in the mid-90's.  In the third lap McPhillips moved up well and was in fourth position with a 4:38.  Bacher let the group get away and was pretty far back at 3:41.  In the final 300 McPhillips could not quite stay with the pack, falling back to a very respectable seventh in 4:33.58.  Bacher made a strong push, just missing All American, ending up in ninth in 4:34.24.  This was McPhillips first outdoor All America award and Bacher's first individual event final--major progress for both runners.              
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen was next up in the finals of the 400IH.  In lane six, Chen got out okay, but seemed lethargic on the backstretch.  Coming into the final turn she started to settle down and she ran a strong finish to gain seventh place out of the nine finalists in 61.25.  This was Chen's eighth All American award; four in the 400IH and four as a member of the DMR at the indoor championship.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Hammer Throw, Slutsky was seeded sixth with a best of 182-4.  Right from the start she seemed cautious, not using the full circle on her turns and not turning at her normal velocity.  Her best throw in the trials was 169-11 and that was her third throw.  It took 174-6 to make finals and 175 to place.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event for the Engineers was the men's Triple Jump.  Billy Ruschel '18, seeded 11th, was the top jumper in the first flight.  His first jump was at least a 48' jump, but he just fouled.  He then jumped a weak 45-0 1/2.  On his final attempt he was right about 49', but again barely fouled, ending his MIT career, but at least going for it and going out in style.  Yorai Shaoul '21, the indoor runner-up and sixth seed at 49-5, did not mess around, starting off with a 50-10 3/4 jump, blowing away the MIT record and putting him in second place.  His next jump was 51-8 1/2, putting him just 5 1/4" out of first place.  On his third attempt Shaoul jumped 51-5 1/2.  Did he have a 52 jump in him?  After the break before finals, Shaoul was not on step and ran through his fourth attempt.  On his fifth attempt he seemed to have had it, but his back foot landed a bit farther back than his front, giving him a 51-3 effort.  On his final attempt, he jumped 51-4 1/4, making five efforts over 50', each would have been a new MIT record.  To say that Shaoul brings his best to the biggest stage is an understatement.
    
    
                  
    
    The men finished with nine points and two All Americans, placing in a tie for 38th.  The women earned five All America honors, scoring 13 1/2 points for 17th place.  All in all a very successful meet for the Engineers.

    ### Engineers Defend New England Division III Titles
    
    
                      
    
    ##### Four More Freshman Records, Personal Bests Lead MIT
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 4-5, 2018              
    
    
                  
    
    Anyone involved in athletics knows that attitude matters.  When a team is highly motivated to win, with everyone focused on a single team goal, and each individual knowing their teammates will be there giving their best effort, amazing things can happen.  Amazing things did indeed happen.  MIT Track & Field defended their New England Division III Championship titles, the women earning their sixth in succession, winning over 34 other teams with 161 points, while the men won their fifth in a row, totaling 167.5 points.  Second place in the women's meet was Williams College with 69 points and Bates College scored 75 points for second place in the men's meet.
    
    
                  
    
    The first day of the overall team competition saw finals in the Decathlon, Discus, Long Jump, 10K and men's Javelin.  Tech had no entries in the Decathlon or men's Javelin, but hoped to do some major damage in the other events.  This was the first really warm weather experienced in New England this season.  Friday's temperature was close to 90 degrees and the humidity was quite high in the early afternoon, but dropped as the day progressed.  The men were seeded to earn 38 points on day one and the women 29.
    
    
                  
    
    The Long Jump and Discus started at the same time.  In the men's Long Jump, Billy Ruschel '18 set the tone for MIT, jumping nearly a foot PR of 23-2 on this second attempt.  Yorai Shaoul '21, responding to his teammates impressive jump, also jumped 23-2, to break his own Freshman Record.  The two led the competition and passed most of their final attempts to save themselves for the Triple Jump the next day.  Shaoul earned first place by having a better second jump 23-0 to 22-11.  The 18 points was a significant improvement on their seeds.  
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's pit, Nneoma Okonkwo '18, nursing an injury that pulled her out of the 100 Meter race, and Haley Strouf '18, seeded fourth and fifth respectively, were having their own battle.  Both were jumping well throughout the competition.  Strouf jumped 18-4 1/2 on her second jump, putting her in fifth place.  Okonkwo, having jumped 18-5 on her first attempt, jumped 18-6 1/2 on her fifth attempt, but did not move her up from her fourth place.  The nine points earned were exactly what they were seeded to do.
    
    
                  
    
    Cody Bratten '18, having a very impressive senior season, continued his series of high performing meets.  Bratten threw 164' in the Discus for a season best to take second place.  Teammate Jon Fakkema '19 added a personal best throw of 156-7 to place fifth and give Tech 13 points, two more than expected.  Bratten is now ranked 12th in the country for Division III.  
    
    
                  
    
    Ariela Slutsky '18 did Bratten one better, winning the women's Discus with a season best 148-7, ranking her 13th in Division III.  The women also earned two points when Folusho Jebutu '20 placed seventh, throwing a personal best 124-9.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event of the day, the 10K, MIT was hoping to score a lot of points, but also not run any faster than necessary for their top runners who were coming back the next day to race the 5K.  In the men's race, the field allowed the MIT runners to establish the desired pace of 5:05 per mile, a solid pace, but certainly not fast enough to do too much damage to Josh Rosenkranz's chance of racing on day two.  Just after the two mile mark, the lead pace of 10 runners began to fall apart.  Within a couple of laps, only Rosenkranz '19 and Alex Knoedler '18 were left in the lead.  Nicholas Waltman '18 was doing battle with one other runner for third place.  They had fallen off the lead significantly, but the group behind them was falling off even worse.  Rosenkranz and Knoedler maintained the 5:05 pace until the final mile, when they slowed slightly after being told they had a 22 second lead.  Rosenkranz won in 31:52.46 and Knoedler placed second in 31:52.59.  Waltman put on a 70 second final 400 to separate himself from his opponent to take third place in 32:39.77, giving MIT 24 points and a total first day of 54 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Mary Eccles '18 was a four minute favorite in the 10K, having run 35:27.11 two weeks earlier.  The senior had already qualified for Nationals and was just trying to score 10 points for her team while hoping to race hard the next day in the 5K, having not had a hard race in two weeks.  Eccles got pulled out early when she matched an unrealistic pace by an ambitious runner in the field.  This put her out front by herself despite intentionally slowing to 6:20 pace.  She accomplished her goal, winning comfortably in 38:59.04.  The real surprise came when Bailee Margolis '19 put herself up towards the front early, then stayed there despite one of her shoes getting pulled off.  Margolis was putting down consistent miles of 6:12, 6:14 and 6:15, when she was feeling the discomfort of running with just one shoe.  She stopped and put her shoe back on, only losing four seconds in the process, and worked her way back to third.  In the final mile she started pulling away, eventually earning an unexpected second place in 39:14.66.  The 18 points gave the women 39 points for day one.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two temperature was cooler at 80 degrees, but sunny with no cloud cover.  The wind was still pretty strong throughout the day.
    
    
                  
    
    If the Engineers could maintain their edge after having such a successful start they would be well on their way to defending their title.  That question was answered in the first final event of the day, the 3,000 Steeplechase.  In the women's race, Jenna Melanson '20, the solid favorite, decided the first lap pace of 87 seconds was not getting it done for her so she dropped an 83 on the field, essentially ending the race.  The sophomore All American cruised home in 10:49.00 to win by 24 seconds.  She is 12th on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Aidan Gilson '19, the favorite in the men's race, tried the same maneuver as Melanson, but did not gain the separation he was hoping for.  In the final lap he was not able to kick it in and got passed in the final 200.  He was able to run a season best 9:24.47.  Seeded to score 13 points, MIT was not satisfied with that total.  Ben Freed '18 ran a great season best of 9:29.42 for third place and Brian Bates '20 came out of his season long funk at the right time to earn fourth with an impressive PR of 9:31.70.  The 19 points sent MIT on their way and they would not be stopped.
    
    
                  
    
    Athletes exceeding their seeds continued to happen for MIT throughout the day.  In the High Jump, Margaret Redfield '21 cleared 5-3 3/4 to earn an unexpected sixth place and establish a Freshman Record.  For a little icing on top, Liana Reilly '21 added an eighth place by clearing 5-2 1/2 on her first attempt.  MIT expected zero points, so the 4 points scored were a pleasant surprise.
    
    
                  
    
    Jasmine Jin '20 continuing her wonderful improvement this year, placed third in the Triple Jump with a personal best of 38-1 1/4.  Elizabeth Weeks '21, placed sixth with a 37-8 performance, giving her the Freshman Record.  Again MIT scored two more points than expected.
    
    
                  
    
    Slutsky surprisingly lost the Hammer Throw competition, placing second despite throwing 168-5, but she made up for the two points lost by earning an unexpected sixth place in the Shot Put, throwing 39-3 1/4.  Jebutu did not score in the Hammer, but did throw a significant PR of 145-2.
    
    
                  
    
    The vaulters seem to always come through for the Engineers and that rang true in this championship as well.  Kari Stromhaug '19 led her teammates to a 2-4-5-7 finish for 19 points.  Stromhaug cleared 12-3 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    The track performances were just as impressive.  Hannah Chen '18 had quite the day.  The senior All American ran 14.62 for a season best for fourth place after running a PR of 14.42 in the trials the day before.  However, the 14.42 will not count towards NCAA qualifying as the wind reading was a little too strong.  Chen came back in the 400IH to earn second place with a season best of 61.14, which is fifth on the NCAA list. 
    
    
                  
    
    The middle-distance group did more than hold their own.  The 800 and 1500 runners were only seeded to score a total of 10 points.  Katie Bacher '20 and Marissa McPhillips '20 took care of that in just the 1500.  Bacher ran a 73 third quarter followed by a 52 final 300 to place second in a PR 3:33.98.  McPhillips, looking like she might get third fell off in the final twenty meters, placing sixth in 4:35.91.  In the 800, Bailey Tregoning '19, returning to her racing level after dealing with various injuries for the past year, ran a perfect race to place second in 2:11.18.  Margaret Trautner '20 added a sixth place in the fast field with her 2:14.33 and Katie Williams '21 placed eighth in 2:14.58.  All three were season bests.  The two events netted MIT 23 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Michelle Menkiti '20, missing the past meet with a pulled hamstring, was able to come back and race the 200.  Seeded to get one point when totally healthy, the sophomore ran a season best 25.09 to place fourth and earn five points for her team.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT ended the women's meet in grand style.  Eccles, wanting a quality race even though her points were no longer needed, placed second in the 5K with a fine 17:31.05.
    
    
                  
    
    McPhillips, Skylar Brooks '20, Bacher and Trautner combined to win the 4x800 relay going away.  Leading from the start, McPhillips ran 2:17.2.  Brooks, all alone throughout her leg, ran 2:22.8.  Bacher expanded the lead with a 2:19.8 and Trautner put it away with a 2:18.6 for a combined time of 9:20.69.
    
    
                  
    
    Kristen Frombach '19 led off the 4x400 Relay with a 60.6, giving MIT a slight lead.  Chen, running her third race of the day, split 57.4 to give her team a solid lead.  Katie Williams maintained a lead with a 59.4, but Colby College was closing quickly.  When Tregoning received the baton she was able to maintain the inside lane but the two teams were essentially even.  Tregoning held her opponent on the outside throughout the turn, but lost the lead.  Entering the final 150 Tregoning's 800 endurance started to show as she gradually closed the lead.  At the finish she took the lead to win in 3:56.01.
    
    
                  
    
    The men also thrived after the Steeplechase.  The Shaoul and Ruschel show was back on in the Triple Jump.  Both opened with 48-3 efforts on their first jump, securing first and second place right then and there.  Shaoul jumped 49-5 on his third jump to take the lead for good and establish a Freshman Record.  On his final attempt Ruschel jumped 48-4 1/2.  The pair are ranked fourth and 10th respectively on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Bratten continued his success in the Shot Put.  He was seeded sixth, but threw his second PR in two weeks, earning third place with a 50-9 3/4 performance.
    
    
                  
    
    In the High Jump, Chris Washington '20 earned a third place with a clear at 6-7.  Teammate Alec Reduker '20, fighting lower back problems, cleared 6-5 to tie for seventh place.  The seven and a half points were not quite what Tech was seeded to score, but with Reduker's back problems it was more than they thought they would get from the event.
    
    
                  
    
    Scott Cameron '19 defended his individual pole vault title, clearing 15-9 in a jump-off.  Everett Brandyberry '21 continued his exceptional freshman championship season, clearing 14-5 1/4 to place sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    The success on the track for the Engineers was mostly due to Chris Sweeney '18 and Benton Wilson '21.  The senior won the 110HH in 14.80, a day after running a PR of 14.73 in the trials.  Sweeney came back in the 400IH with another PR, running 53.42, but finishing in second place.  He is ranked 17th nationally in the 400IH.  He will likely need to get under 53 seconds to remain among the top 20, which is the number of men selected for each individual event.
    
    
                  
    
    Wilson, the freshman record holder in both the 100 and 200 for MIT, fought off his shin splint pain and delivered a fourth place in the 100 with a 10.87 and a fifth place in the 200 with a 21.91.
    
    
                  
    
    The men performed similar to the women, closing the meet out with a strong statement.  Rosenkranz sat on the leaders, perhaps a little too long, and was unable to match their closing speed.  Running 1:40 in the final 600 meters, Rosenkranz was only able to manage third place in 14:53.04, a pretty impressive double coming back from his 10K victory.  Billy Woltz '20 added a PR 15:03.63 to finish sixth and add three more points.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x800 Relay, Nathan Munet '19 returned from the open 800 to run a 1:55.2 leadoff leg.  Dylan Doblar '21 coming back from the 1500, split 1:58.8.  Ellery Rajagopal '21 ran 2:00.3 to keep his team in second place.  Simon Alford '20, two weeks after returning from injury, ran 1:56.0 to secure a second place in year best 7:50.66.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event was the 4x400 Relay.  MIT, seeded eighth, believed they could do better than that.  Sweeney came back for his third race.  He was placed in lane eight, which when you run a three-turn stagger, is in no-man's land.  He did not match his best, but still split a respectable 51.2.  Gilson working on his speed, delivered a 51.6.  Ken Acquah '20, running fresh, dropped a huge PR of 49.9 to bring his team into contention despite having to dodge people in getting the baton and in handing off.  Benton Wilson ran an excellent 49.0 anchor to put MIT in sixth place in a season best 3:21.97.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers will now focus on the NCAA Division III Championship in three weeks.  The next two weeks provide excellent competitive opportunities for individuals to improve their marks.

    ### Focus on National Qualifying Marks Brings Excellent Individual Results
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 11-12, 2018              
    
    
                  
    
    After two hard fought championship meets (NEWMAC, New England Division III) that produced victories for both the MIT Men's and Women's Track & Field teams, it was a refreshing opportunity for the Engineers to compete and not focus on how many points the team was scoring.  The New England Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association (NEIcAAA) Championship is certainly a championship opportunity for some, particularly some of the Division I colleges, but for MIT, having won the championships they were focused on and with the NCAA Division III Track & Field Championship in two weeks, it was time to focus on performances instead of points.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT left four national qualifying athletes and a couple of others at home to recover from the past two weekends.  Those they brought were hoping to move up on the NCAA performance list and solidify their chance of being among the top 20 men or 22 women in their respective events, earning the trip to Nationals, which will be held at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse.
    
    
                  
    
    The only victory earned by MIT was by Cody Bratten '18.  The senior continued his impressive season, throwing a personal best 169-2 on his final throw to claim the victory in the Discus Throw.  Bratten is now number two on the all-time MIT list and number eight on the NCAA performance list.
    
    
                  
    
    Aidan Gilson '19 led MIT in the 3,000 Steeplechase.  The junior was in a great position early on, but when the time to move was there he chose to back off. After a 77 and then a 76 lap, Gilson decided he wanted to go for it.  Running a 69 final 400 (33 final 200) Gilson ran a season best 9:09.62 for second place and, number nine on the NCAA list.  Ben Freed '18 ran an excellent race and a personal best of 9:13.48 to place eighth.  Freed is currently 13th on the NCAA list.  Brian Bates '20, ran his best 2K ever, coming through in 6:11.  The sophomore gave up at that point, but still managed a personal best of 9:31.57.  Bates can undoubtedly run sub 9:15 if he can put it together mentally.
    
    
                  
    
    Chris Sweeney '18 qualified for the 400IH final by running a personal best 53.20 on Friday, which moved him to number 15 on the NCAA performance list with five days remaining to qualify.  In the final the senior worked too hard to run fast and fell off after 200 meters.  Nevertheless his 54.06 placed fourth in the event.
    
    
                  
    
    Benton Wilson '21 also qualified for the finals on Saturday.  In the 200 trials, despite having lane one he ran 21.96.  Unfortunately, his performance earned him lane one again in the finals as the seventh qualifier.  The freshman placed sixth in the finals in 22.07.
    
    
                  
    
    Also on Friday, Chris Washington '20 placed in a two-way tie for sixth place in the High Jump with a 6-5 performance.
    
    
                  
    
    Jon Fakkema '19 did not earn points but did throw a season best in the Hammer with a 165-6 performance.  The men placed 11th out of 36 scoring teams with 29.5 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's top place winner was also in the Discus Throw.  Ariela Slutsky '18 placed second with a throw of 148-3, missing first place by six inches.  Slutsky is ranked sixth in the Hammer and 13th in the Discus on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Jenna Melanson '20 had a perfect opportunity presented to her in the 3,000 Steeplechase.  The second place runner was setting a pace that would get her in the mid to low 10:30's, but she did not seize the opportunity.  The sophomore still ran a season best and placed third with a 10:43.76.  Melanson is ranked seventh nationally.
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's 1500, Katie Bacher '20 did not let a slow early pace of 2:29 affect her.  She made a strong move with 700 to go, running a 72 third 400 and then a 50 second final 300 to win her section in a personal best 4:31.71 and place fifth overall and the top Division III runner.  Marissa McPhillips '20 was right with Bacher until the final 300, but still held on to place 8th overall in a new personal best of 4:34.09.  Bacher is now ninth on the NCAA performance list and McPhillips 19th.
    
    
                  
    
    On Friday MIT scored some points in the field events. Nneoma Okonkwo '18 jumped 18-4 1/2 to place sixth in the Long Jump.  Jacqueline Ahrens '21 led the MIT pole vaulters with a sixth place effort, clearing 11-7 3/4.  Kari Stromhaug '20 and Makenzie Patarino '19 were not able to clear their opening height.  Ahrens is 10th and Stromhaug 13th on the NCAA list at 12-5 1/2 and 12-4 1/2 respectively.  Okonkwo is 24th on the NCAA list with one meet to go to move up.
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen '18 just missed qualifying for the finals in the 100HH, finishing ninth in the trials in 14.76.  However, she did make the finals in the 400IH, running 61.32 in the trials.  In the finals Chen was not as up, fading in the homestretch to place seventh in 62.55.  The senior is ranked sixth on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Although she did not quite run a season best, Bailey Tregoning '19 placed eighth in the 800 with a 2:11.98.  Running outdoor personal bests, Margaret Trautner '20 ran 2:13.39 and Katie Williams '21 ran 2:13.44.  Tregoning is ranked sixth on the NCAA list while Trautner and Williams are ranked 22nd and 23rd.
    
    
                  
    
    The women finished eighth of 39 scoring teams with a total of 28 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Those nationally ranked who did not make the trip were Yorai Shaoul '21 and Billy Ruschel '18, ranked fourth and 10th in the Triple Jump, Alec Reduker '20 ranked eighth in the High Jump and Mary Eccles '18 ranked ninth in the 10K.
    
    
                  
    
    Thursday is the final day to earn an NCAA qualifying mark.  MIT will host the New England Region's Final Qualifier that day, starting at 5:00 p.m.

    MIT successfully defended their NEWMAC Outdoor Track & Field Championship titles today at Springfield College, the women winning their 10th consecutive championship and the men earning their 18th in succession, having only lost the title in 2000.  Although the women scratched two of their top-seeded 5K runners, and the men three of their 5K runners as well as their 4x400 squad, both teams won handedly.  The women scored 213 points, 72.5 more than second place WPI, and the men 274.5, 53 up on runner-up WPI.
    
    
                  
    
    Although there was a little wind, the weather could not have been much better.  For the first day this season the temperature was conducive for outstanding track and field performances.  MIT took full advantage, highlighted by three freshman records and some solid future championship qualifying performances.  Jacqueline Ahrens '21 established a new MIT Freshman record in the Pole Vault, clearing 12-5 1/2 to place second and move her into a tie for sixth on the NCAA Division III ranking this season.  Benton Wilson '21, who already owns the freshman records in both the 100 and 200 meter dashes, lowered his record in the 200 to a 21.69, which is still a couple tenths away from qualifying for nationals.  Yorai Shaoul '21 added the freshman long jump record to his triple jump record, jumping 23-0 to win the event on his final jump.  This mark ranks him 31st nationally, meaning he will need another eight inches or so to qualify for nationals.  Shaoul's 48-4 record, which he tied to win this competition has him fifth ranked nationally.  Shaoul was presented with the NEWMAC Field Event Athlete of the meet for his performances.
    
    
                  
    
    The seniors led the way for MIT and will be difficult for the Engineers to replace next year.  The seniors combined for 195.5 points; 99.5 for the men and 96 for the women in a scoring format of 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1.  For the men, Cody Bratten '18 scored 28 points, earning victories in the Shot Put and the Discus while also throwing a personal best of 151-4 in the Hammer to place second.  Bratten's Shot Put victory of 50-0 3/4 was a personal best and his Discus win was a season best of 160-8.  Bratten is ranked 14th on the national list.
    
    
                  
    
    Chris Sweeney '18 accounted for 20 of those points, winning both the 110HH and the 400IH.  His victory in the 110HH was a personal best of 14.88 and his 54.02 in the 400IH was a season best.  Sweeney is ranked 17th in NCAA DIII for the 400IH.
    
    
                  
    
    Billy Ruschel '18 and his fellow horizontal jumpers added 23 points.  Ruschel placed second in the Triple Jump (45-7 3/4) and third in the Long Jump with a personal best of 22-0 3/4.  Jason Villanueva '18 and Ryan Prinster '18 added a fourth and fifth respectively in the Triple Jump as MIT placed 1-2-4-5.
    
    
                  
    
    The distance squad was responsible for the remainder of the senior's points contribution.  David Walter '18 used an excellent negative split strategy (5:04, 5:01, 4:54) to win the 5K, finishing with a 32 final 200 to win in 15:31.13.  In the 10K, Nicholas Waltman '18 and Alex Knoedler '18 led MIT to a 1-2-3-5 scoring blast against their opponents.  After a controlled 8K in 26:28, MIT picked up the pace.  Waltman pushed ahead for the victory in 32:36.22 and Knoedler chose not to challenge, finishing second in 32:42.73.
    
    
                  
    
    The women seniors were also led by a thrower.  Ariela Slutsky '18 also scored 28 points, taking victories in the Hammer and Discus while placing second in the Shot Put.  Limited in the Shot Put all year due to a thumb injury from that event, Slutsky threw 38-5 from a power position, a season best.  In the Discus Slutsky won easily with a throw of 143-0 and likewise, won the Hammer with a throw of 172-6.  Slutsky is nationally ranked in both the Hammer and Discus; 17th in the Discus and 4th in the Hammer.
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen '18 scored 22 points for the Engineers as she won the 400IH, placed second in the 110HH, ran a leg on the 4x100 Relay that placed third, as well as a leg on the victorious 4x400 team.  Chen ran a season best 14.65 in the 100HH.  In the 400IH she ran 62.47 to win the event.  Running the second leg on the 4x400 team, Chen split 56.7 as she put her team in the lead for good.  The quartet of Kristen Frombach '19, Chen, Katie Williams '21 and Bailey Tregoning '19 ran a season best 3:56.80.  Chen is ranked 14th nationally in the 100HH and 7th in the 400IH.
    
    
                  
    
    Nneoma Okonkwo '18 contributed 17.5 points to the cause.  The senior won the Long Jump, matching her season best of 18-6, as well as placing third in the 100 with a season best of 12.47.  She also ran a leg on the 4x100 Relay.  Okonkwo is ranked 16th nationally in the Long Jump.
    
    
                  
    
    Mary Eccles '18, scored 14 points towards her team's victory.  She first ran her non-specialty 1500 meters, placing fifth in 4:46.92 and then came back in the 5K, winning in a sit and kick 18:19.99.
    
    
                  
    
    Haley Strouf '18 added 9.5 points to the seniors' total, placing second in the Long Jump (17-10 1/4) and running a leg on the 4x100 Relay.  Dana Balek '18 added five points with her fourth place finish in the Javelin, throwing 112-2.
    
    
                  
    
    The men won three additional victories. Chris Washington '20, cleared 6-6 in the High Jump to win, just missing 6-9 1/2.  Jon Fakkema '19 took first place honors in the Hammer Throw with a toss of 161-1.  Aidan Gilson '19 was victorious in the 3,000 Meter Steeplechase, taking the lead early in the race, running a season best 9:26.65.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's only other victory was a big one, as Jenna Melanson '20 won the Steeplechase in a season best 10:48.36.  The sophomore currently holds the eighth fastest time in Division III.
    
    
                  
    
    Next weekend MIT hosts the New England Division III Track and Field Championship.  While both the women and men should do well, neither will be seeded to win and defend their titles.  The men have won the past four years in a row while the women have won five consecutive New England Division III titles.

    ### Women Win Quad Meet With Balance, Men Place Close Third
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 7, 2018              
    
    
                  
    
    In the first full-team outdoor meet for MIT, the women showed incredible balance between the running and field events to easily win a quadrangular meet versus Bates, RPI and Tufts at Tufts University.  The NCAA recommended scoring for four teams - 9,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 for individual events with no more than two scoring for each team, and 9,7,6,5 with only one relay scoring for each team was what was used. The women won 12 of the 19 events with both Ariela Slutsky '18 and Michelle Menkiti '20 winning two events for the Engineers.  The final score was MIT 212, Tufts 186, Bates 132.5 and RPI 122.5.
    
    
                  
    
    The men did not fair so well.  Missing the top three 800 runners due to injury, two distance runners due to an ROTC commitment and a general lack of sprinters, Tech put together what they could, but failed to capitalize when their top runners were in position to dominate their events.  Despite not competing Alec Reduker '20 (tight back) and Billy Ruschel '18 (precautionary), MIT's depth in the field events proved adequate to make-up for the missing stars.  When the dust settled, RPI pulled out the victory with 175 points to 172 for Tufts, 170 for MIT and 142 for Bates.
    
    
                  
    
    The weather certainly hampered performances, but with sunny skies,  mid-40 degree temperature and 10-15 mph winds, it was much better than had been expected.  The women took first place in six of the eight field events.  Slutsky won both the Hammer and Discus events, throwing 164-9 and 133-9 respectively.  The senior also added a third place in the Shot Put.  Kari Stromhaug '19 added a win for the cause in the Pole Vault, clearing 12-1 1/2 to lead a 1-2-3 effort as Jacqueline Ahrens '21 cleared 11-7 3/4 and Makenzie Patarino cleared 10-8 for second and third.  Nneoma Okonkwo '18 took first place in the Long Jump with her 18-6 performance.  Elizabeth Weeks '21 earned the victory in the Triple Jump, jumping 36-11 1/2 also leading her group to a 1-2-3 finish.  Jasmine Jin '20 (35-11 1/4) and Lucy Lee '21 (34-1 1/2) finished second and third.  Dana Balek '18 earned the other field event victory, taking first place in the Javelin with a throw of 123-2.
    
    
                  
    
    Menkiti claimed two of the six running event victories and played a key role in another.  The sophomore took the 100 and 200 with weather affected times of 12.81 and 25.80.  She also led off the victorious 4x100 Relay in a 49.45 effort.  The other members of the victorious relay were Haley Strouf '18, Hannah Chen '18 and Okonkwo.  Chen added a victory along with a second place, both in the hurdle events.  She won her specialty, the 400IH in 1:04.10 and was runner-up in the 100HH in 15.37 (15.18 Trials).  Margaret Trautner '20 won her first ever 1500 in 4:39.19.  Using Jamie Lord of RPI and teammate Marissa McPhillips '20 to block the wind, the sophomore was able to edge out McPhillips for the victory.  The final victory was earned by Trautner, McPhillips, Katie Williams '21 and Bailey Tregoning '19 in the 4x400 Relay.  The quartet never trailed and pulled away from the field with a 4:04.26 performance.
    
    
                  
    
    Although not a winning effort, Mary Eccles '18 ran an impressive outdoor PR of 17:09.62 in the 5K.  Katherine Cook of Bates took the pace out in a 76 for the first quarter despite the wind being pretty strong.  Eccles, fresh off her indoor All America effort, went with her.  Katie Bacher '20 running in her debut 5,000 also went with her, but was not expecting that pace and it immediately took her out of the race mentally.  The sophomore nevertheless ran a respectable 18:02.40.  Jenna Melanson '20, who ran her own race, disregarding the initial pace and settling in with 5:40 pace, went on to finish in a PR of 17:48.82.
    
    
                  
    
    The men took first place in all the jumping events.  Despite Reduker not competing, his teammates claimed the top three places in the High Jump with Chris Washington '20 earning first place at 6-4.  Yorai Shaoul '21 was the only double winner for the Engineers and he set an MIT Freshman Record in the Triple Jump with his 48-4 victory.  In the Long Jump the freshman jumped 22-1 1/2.  Scott Cameron '19 completed the jumps sweep with his 15-5 victory in the Pole Vault.
    
    
                  
    
    While not winning any of the throwing events, both Cody Bratten '18 and Jon Fakkema '19 scored in each of their three events.  Bratten took second in his specialty the Discus (158-0) and fourth and eighth in the Shot Put and Hammer respectively.  Fakkema was second in the Hammer (160-11), fifth in the Discus and sixth in the Shot Put.
    
    
                  
    
    In the running events, Chris Sweeney '18 and Benton Wilson '21 were the most dominating for Tech.  Sweeney won the 400IH in 54.74 and also placed second in the 110HH in 15.03.  Wilson, in addition to leading off the 4x100 Relay, won the 200 in 22.34 out of lane one, and earned second place in his first collegiate outdoor 400 in 50.36.
    
    
                  
    
    In both the 3000SC and the 5K, events MIT typically dominates, runners failed to deliver.  In the Steeplechase, Aidan Gilson '19 (coming off an illness) and Ben Freed '18 (coming off an injury) put themselves in front of the pack, pushed the pace early, but only succeeded in putting a target on their back and blocking the wind for their opponents.  Gilson faded to third and Freed to sixth at the finish.  While Kent Slaney '21 and David Walter '18 did not lead and did not run an unreasonable pace, neither had it at the end as they faded to seventh and eighth in 15:25.95 and 15:28.02 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    Next Saturday, MIT will travel to Williams College for a good old-fashioned dual meet between the Ephs and Engineers.   The Williams College team has looked impressive early in the season and appears to be more than a formidable opponent for Tech.

    ### Ariela Slutsky Takes Down MIT Hammer Record
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 21, 2018              
    
    
                  
    
    In the final non-championship meet of the season, MIT rested most of their track & field athletes in preparation to defend their NEWMAC and New England Division III Championship titles.  However, in addition to the throwers and vaulters, a few competed to either improve their seed or to take advantage of the competitive opportunity.
    
    
                  
    
    As a rule, the MIT Sean Collier Invitational is not a highly competitive track and field meet, but there were a few exceptions, particularly the efforts of Wadeline Jonathas '20 from UMass Boston.  The defending NCAA Division III Champion in the 200 and 400 from the 2017 outdoor championship and the four time individual champion from this year's NCAA Championship (60, 200, 400, Long Jump), won the 100 in 11.66, the Long Jump in 19-2 and ran a scorching 4x400 leg.
    
    
                  
    
    Among the performances by MIT athletes there were none better than what Ariela Slutsky '18 did in the Hammer Throw.  Shortly after exclaiming her frustration at not being able to throw very far and not being able to focus on her technical problems, she commenced to throw four personal bests en route to a new MIT record of 182-4 1/2, which is fourth on the current NCAA Division III ranking.  Also throwing a personal best in the Hammer Throw was Folusho Jebutu '20 (136-1 3/4).  
    
    
                  
    
    For the male throwers, Cody Bratten '18 had a personal best in two events and a season best in the other.  Starting with the Discus Throw, Bratten threw 158-0 3/4 to win the event with his season best.  In the Hammer he threw a PR of 148-1 3/4 to finish behind teammate Jon Fakkema '19 (160-7 3/4).  Then in the Shot Put, the senior threw his final PR of 49-1 3/4 to win the event.  Fakkema threw a PR of 141-2 1/4 in the Discus.
    
    
                  
    
    For the women Kari Stromhaug '19 won the collegiate portion of the Pole Vault, clearing 12-1 1 /2, losing only to Cimmy Virdi '16, who cleared 13-1 1/2.  Elizabeth Weeks '21 jumped a season best 37-0 1/2 to win the Triple Jump.  Lindsey McAllister '21 took first place honors in the Steeplechase, running 11:51.54.  In the one loaded event for MIT, the 800, Katie Williams '21 took the race out in 64 to set up the MIT duo of Bailey Tregoning '19 and Margaret Trautner '20 as they went 1-2 in 2:14.17 and 2:15.30 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    On the men's side, Ellery Rajagopal '21 had the biggest breakthrough, finishing second in the 800 in a personal best 1:57.42.  Nathan Munet '19, racing for the first time this season, went to the lead and took the brunt of the strong wind.  He faded in the final 150 to finish fourth in 1:58.46.
    
    
                  
    
    Scott Cameron '19 won the Pole Vault by clearing 15-5.  Chris Washington '20 claimed the victory in the High Jump at 6-6 and Ryan Prinster '18 was victorious in the Triple Jump with a 46-2  1/2 effort.
    
    
                  
    
    Most of the team goals were accomplished although a few will have to step up pretty big in next week's conference championship if they want their season to continue.  The teams will try to defend their NEWMAC Conference titles at Springfield College.  The men have not lost the title since 2000 and the women have won every championship since 2009.

    ### Alec Reduker Leads Engineers in Spring Trip Meet
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 1, 2018              
    
    
                  
    
    While spring break brought a week of relaxation for most in the MIT community, the track and field teams were hard at work preparing for the upcoming season. As is the case every year, the technical athletes (throwers, jumpers, vaulters, hurdlers, sprinters) make their pilgrimage to warmer climes in the hopes that they would be able to capitalize on the warmer weather and come away with some New England DIII and NCAA DIII qualifying marks under what could potentially be the most favorable conditions of the season. 
    
    
                  
    
      
    
                    Throughout the week, the teams practiced each morning and focused on strengthening their bond in the afternoon.  The weather was great, and training appeared to go well for each event group, with the California sun and warm air energizing everybody. If the beginning of the week was any indication, the teams were primed and ready to compete.  However, Saturday at UCSD told a slightly different story.     
    
                    In the California Collegiate Open, MIT had the opportunity to compete alongside Division I powerhouses, Wisconsin, Louisville, and the throws group from USC, while also lining up against New England rivals Williams and Middlebury among other colleges competing from the local area. Beyond the opponents however, Saturday brought many challenges that the teams needed to solve, in order to bring the trip to a successful conclusion.
    
    
                  
    
      
    
                    These challenges included a long layoff between competitions and maintaining team energy with a smaller group in the larger outdoor environment.  Additionally, the weather, while still warm, overcast in the high 50's and low 60's for much of the day, presented a significant change from the 80 degree days the teams enjoyed in practice. In their effort to navigate these challenges some athletes rose to the occasion, turning in PR's and national qualifying marks, while others struggled to shake off their rust and return to form.  Ultimately, while performances were effective enough to score points, many fell flat, when compared with the marks they were reaching at the end of the indoor season.
    
    
                  
    
      
    
                    On the men's side in the running events, freshman Benton Wilson started his season off strong, etching six points with a seventh and fifth place showing in the 100 and 200 meters respectively, running slightly behind his lifetime bests in each event, while Chris Sweeney '18 placed third in the 400 Hurdles, running approximately half a second off his career best, finishing in a time of 54.16.  
    
                      
    
                    In the field events, the High Jump took center stage early on, creating an exciting competition that saw Alec Reduker '20 take the victory on his final attempt at 6'10.75", setting a new career best on a jump that has historically qualified for the NCAA Championships. Finishing right behind him, was sophomore Chris Washington who on two misses at 6'8.75" passed on his final attempt to take one shot at a national qualifying mark.  As the bar was raised, Washington took his shot at a national mark, but it was just out of reach on the day, dropping him to third overall. Also, in the event, sophomore Steven Speck would go on to take seventh, with his clearance of 6'2.75", tying the Triple Jump group for highest scoring event group on the day with 18 points.
    
    
                  
    
      
    
                    Merely minutes later, senior Billy Ruschel had to overcome a deficit of his own, using the last jump of the competition to reclaim the lead and secure his win in the Triple Jump, taking first with a mark of 46'11.75".  Senior Jason Villanueva took third with a jump of 45'3", while senior Ryan Prinster struggled on the day, but managed to add two more points to scoring, finishing in seventh. 
    
    
                  
    
      
    
    
    With the win in the Triple Jump, Ruschel closed out the day with a team high 15 points after opening the day with a career best in the long jump of 21'11", taking fourth overall.  However, this did not stop Cody Bratten '18 from trying to close that gap.  The senior thrower finished with 13 points, scoring five in the Shot Put and eight in the Discus, which was called early due to darkness.  Junior Jon Fakkema had a strong showing in the Hammer, placing third among Division 3 competitors with a throw of 162'0", and sixth in the Shot Put. While not a scoring mark in the Hammer, sophomore Albert Menio also rose to the occasion on the day, with a strong showing and a nearly three meter lifetime best of 134'3".  
    
      
    
    On the women's side, senior Hannah Chen added her name to the national discussion by claiming fourth place in the 400 hurdles, with a time of 1:02.31. That performance debuted Chen at number three on the national list. Prior to her run in the hurdles, Chen also teamed up with sophomore Michelle Menkiti, seniors Haley Strouf and Nneoma Okonkwo to race the 4x100 relay. A quartet with high aspirations, the team finished fifth with a time of 49.24, as they worked to improve their passing and timing.  
    
      
    
    In the field events, senior Ariela Slutsky and the throws group became the bedrock of scoring for the day. Slutsky led the way in the Hammer Throw, scoring ten for finishing first among division three athletes with a throw of 49.76 meters (163'3"). She was joined by sophomore Elise McCormack-Kuhman, who despite being stung by a Stingray earlier in the week found a way to unleash a 25 foot lifetime best of 135'7" to earn a much needed four points for the team.  Rounding out scoring was sophomore Folusho Jebutu, who added two points with a throw of 40.08 meters (131'6").  
    
      
    
    In the horizontal jumps, the women achieved mixed results on the day, scoring several points but ultimately failing to reach their goals.  In the Long Jump, Strouf and Okonkwo finished fourth and fifth overall, accounting for nine points, but their marks of 18'1.75" and 17'9.5" are well short of what will be needed to punch their tickets to next month's NCAA Championship. Hours later, when the Triple Jump rolled around, conditions were at their coolest for sophomore Jasmine Jin and freshman Elizabeth Weeks. The outdoor season started off well for Jin, who used a strong opening round jump of 37'8.5" to secure fourth place, while Weeks struggled to an eighth place finish with a jump of 36'0.75".  In the Pole Vault freshman Jacqueline Ahrens was the top performer for MIT, tying for second place overall (tying for first among Div. III), with a clearance of 11'1.75".  
    
      
    
    Ultimately, the teams struggled to capitalize on their early successes and spread the energy throughout the stadium, as they placed sixth and eighth overall.  However, the teams returned from California with 29 New England DIII qualifying marks and two likely NCAA qualifying performances. Next week, it's back to cooler temperatures, when distance and mid-distance runners return to the track to join the speed and power groups in their first real team test of the year Saturday in a quad meet with Bates, RPI, MIT and Tufts.

    ### Women Finish Regular Season Undefeated / 
    
    
                      
    
    #### Benton Wilson Sets Two Freshman Records in Men's Losing Effort
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 14, 2018              
    
    
                  
    
    The third annual Dick Farley / Gordon Kelly, Williams College vs. MIT dual meet was expected to be close for both the men and women.  With both teams dealing with some injuries and the weather not expected to be favorable for outstanding performances it was expected to be a matter of which team wanted it more.  Over the past four decades the two programs have dominated New England Division III Track & Field.  If there are common threads between the two programs it is a team mentality and a do not give up attitude.
    
    
                  
    
    The weather was much better than expected in that it did not rain.  Temperatures in the mid-40's, occasional sun and a consistent 15-20 mph wind hitting the runners on the turn entering the home stretch in the oval events certainly affected overall performances.
    
    
                  
    
    Although the score of the men's MIT vs. Williams meet was 104 to 93 in Williams favor, what it really came down to was a matter of .11 seconds.  With the relays scoring 5-0 and the Engineers not expected to win any of the three relays, they knew if they could win one or two, it would be as much as a 20 point swing and likely enough to win the meet.  In the 4x100 relay, the quartet of Benton Wilson '21, Chris Washington '20, Steven Speck '20 and Ryan Prinster '18 had near perfect handoffs to come within .04 of winning the event 43.47 to 43.51.  In the next to last event, the fatigued and unlikely foursome of Chris Sweeney '18, Ken Acquah '20, Kent Slaney '21 and Benton Wilson '21 came within .07 of winning, running respective splits of 49.9, 52.3, 52.1 and 48.3 for a 3:22.70 for MIT to 3:22.63 for Williams.
    
    
                  
    
    The overall theme of the men's meet was that MIT dominated the field events and sprints/hurdles, with Williams ruling the middle-distance and distance events.  Neither team had their best lineups in the meet.  MIT had numerous athletes out, who were not quite ready to compete after returning from injury and a couple others in different events than usual to try and get championship qualifying performances in other events.  Other than the javelin, an event where the Engineers are void of competitors, MIT was able to claim victory in every field event.  Cody Bratten '18 was the one double winner, claiming the Discus (152-10) and the Shot Put (46-11 1/2).  Yorai Shaoul '21, unable to triple jump due to a bruised heel, won the Long Jump in a personal best 22-9 1/4 effort, moving him to eighth on the MIT all-time list and just 3/4" off the freshman record.  Scott Cameron '19 won the Pole Vault at 13-11 1/4, Chris Washington the High Jump at 6-07, Jon Fakkema '19 the Hammer with a 155-9 throw and Ryan Prinster the Triple Jump with a 44-9 1/2 jump.
    
    
                  
    
    Tech had two double winners in the running events.  Chris Sweeney  ruled the hurdle events, taking the 110HH in 15.11 as he battled the cross wind, and the 400IH in 55.47.  Wilson, in addition to both the 4x100 and 4x400, ran two freshman records in recording victories in the 100 (10.83) and the 200 (21.82).
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers managed three second place efforts in the running events with strong efforts from Dylan Doblar '21 in the 1500 (4:02.68), Alex Knoedler '18 in the 5K (15:16.19) and a 9:36.53 performance in the 3,000 Meter Steeplechase from Aidan Gilson '19, who is still rounding into physical and mental shape.
    
    
                  
    
    With three events to go (5K, 4x400, 4x800) Tech had taken a four point lead.  Needing to score nine points in the 5K to clinch the meet, or four points to put themselves in a position of only needing to win one of the two final relays, Knoedler was the only one who could come through for MIT, earning three points for second.
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's meet, MIT again dominated the field events, winning all but two of them, but also claimed the middle-distance events to secure the victory prior to the 5K.
    
    
                  
    
    Ariela Slutsky '18 won three events to lead MIT to an undefeated season.  Slutsky claimed first in the Discus (143-9), Hammer (169-2) and Shot Put (35-6 3/4).  The other field events victories came from Kari Stromhaug '19 in the Pole Vault with a 12-4 1/2 clearance, which is currently number seven on the NCAA list; Haley Strouf '18 in the Long Jump at 17-10 13/4; and Jasmine Jin '20 in the Triple Jump with a jump of 36-8 1/2.  The throwers took 30 out of a possible 44 points and the jumpers were not far behind, scoring 28 of a possible 44.
    
    
                  
    
    As the running events began, MIT was hoping for some great races in their favor.  However, the 4x100 team of Michelle Menkiti '20, Haley Strouf '18, Hannah Chen '18, and Nneoma Okonkwo '18 were unable to stay with their counterparts, and in the 3,000 Steeplechase, Jenna Melanson '20 was ill prepared for the competition when she was unable to pull away in the first couple of laps, although she did run 11:02, a fine first attempt for the season.
    
    
                  
    
    Fortunately the 1500 was a surprise in that the Engineers claimed the top three places led by Katie Bacher '20 in 4:40.00.  Margaret Trautner '20 was second in 4:45.30 and Mary Eccles '18 surprised everyone but herself with a third place 4:45.63.
    
    
                  
    
    From that point MIT was off and running.  The trio of Bailey Tregoning '19, Katie Williams and Trautner delivered a 1-3-4 finish in the 800 with respective times of 2:16.07, 2:18.17 and 2:19.47.  Michelle Menkiti won both the 100 and 200 in 12.57 and 25.37.  Hannah Chen won the 400IH in 61.93 when the apparent first place runner from Williams was DQ'd when there was no hurdle in her lane at the first flight.
    
    
                  
    
    With the meet won, and some overuse going on, MIT pulled their 4x400, but won the 4x800 in 9:19.38 with Bacher, Williams, Trautner and Tregoning to reach the final score of MIT 107, Williams 92.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT will take a few middle-distance runners to Princeton for the Larry Ellis Invitational on Friday and will host the Sean Collier Invitational on Saturday at the Morrison track.
