                  <h3>Engineers Defend New England Division III Titles</h3>
                  <h5>Four More Freshman Records, Personal Bests Lead MIT</h5>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                </center>
              
              
              <p>May 4-5, 2018              </p>
              <p>Anyone involved in athletics knows that attitude matters.&nbsp; When a team is highly motivated to win, with everyone focused on a single team goal, and each individual knowing their teammates will be there giving their best effort, amazing things can happen.&nbsp; Amazing things did indeed happen.&nbsp; MIT Track &amp; Field defended their <a href="ned3.res.pdf">New England Division III Championship</a> titles, the women earning their sixth in succession, winning over 34 other teams with 161 points, while the men won their fifth in a row, totaling 167.5 points.&nbsp; Second place in the women's meet was Williams College with 69 points and Bates College scored 75 points for second place in the men's meet.</p>
              <p>The first day of the overall team competition saw finals in the Decathlon, Discus, Long Jump, 10K and men's Javelin.&nbsp; Tech had no entries in the Decathlon or men's Javelin, but hoped to do some major damage in the other events.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the first really warm weather experienced in New England this season.&nbsp; Friday's temperature was close to 90 degrees and the humidity was quite high in the early afternoon, but dropped as the day progressed.&nbsp; The men were seeded to earn 38 points on day one and the women 29.</p>
              <p>The Long Jump and Discus started at the same time.&nbsp; In the men's Long Jump, Billy Ruschel '18 set the tone for MIT, jumping nearly a foot PR of 23-2 on this second attempt.&nbsp; Yorai Shaoul '21, responding to his teammates impressive jump, also jumped 23-2, to break his own Freshman Record.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two led the competition and passed most of their final attempts to save themselves for the Triple Jump the next day.&nbsp; Shaoul earned first place by having a better second jump 23-0 to 22-11.&nbsp; The 18 points was a significant improvement on their seeds.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>In the women's pit, Nneoma Okonkwo '18, nursing an injury that pulled her out of the 100 Meter race, and Haley Strouf '18, seeded fourth and fifth respectively, were having their own battle.&nbsp; Both were jumping well throughout the competition.&nbsp; Strouf jumped 18-4 1/2 on her second jump, putting her in fifth place.&nbsp; Okonkwo, having jumped 18-5 on her first attempt, jumped 18-6 1/2 on her fifth attempt, but did not move her up from her fourth place.&nbsp; The nine points earned were exactly what they were seeded to do.</p>
              <p>Cody Bratten '18, having a very impressive senior season, continued his series of high performing meets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bratten threw 164' in the Discus for a season best to take second place. &nbsp;Teammate Jon Fakkema '19 added a personal best throw of 156-7 to place fifth and give Tech 13 points, two more than expected.&nbsp; Bratten is now ranked 12th in the country for Division III.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Ariela Slutsky '18 did Bratten one better, winning the women's Discus with a season best 148-7, ranking her 13th in Division III.&nbsp;&nbsp;The women also earned two points when Folusho Jebutu '20 placed seventh, throwing a personal best 124-9.</p>
              <p>In the final event of the day, the 10K, MIT was hoping to score a lot of points, but also not run any faster than necessary for their top runners who were coming back the next day to race the 5K.&nbsp; In the men's race, the field allowed the MIT runners to establish the desired pace of 5:05 per mile, a solid pace, but certainly not fast enough to do too much damage to Josh Rosenkranz's chance of racing on day two.&nbsp; Just after the two mile mark, the lead pace of 10 runners began to fall apart.&nbsp; Within a couple of laps, only Rosenkranz '19 and Alex Knoedler '18 were left&nbsp;in the lead.&nbsp; Nicholas Waltman '18 was doing battle with one other runner for third&nbsp;place. &nbsp;They had fallen off the lead significantly, but the group behind them was falling off even worse.&nbsp; Rosenkranz and Knoedler maintained the 5:05 pace until the final mile, when they slowed slightly after being told they had a 22 second lead.&nbsp; Rosenkranz won in 31:52.46 and Knoedler placed second in 31:52.59.&nbsp; Waltman put on a 70 second final 400 to separate himself from his opponent to take third place&nbsp;in 32:39.77, giving MIT 24 points and a total first day of 54 points.</p>
              <p>Mary Eccles&nbsp;'18 was&nbsp;a four minute favorite in the 10K, having run 35:27.11 two weeks earlier.&nbsp; The senior had already qualified for Nationals and was just trying to score 10 points for her team while hoping to race hard the next day in the 5K, having not had a hard race in two weeks.&nbsp; Eccles got pulled out early when she matched an unrealistic pace by an ambitious runner in the field.&nbsp; This put her out front by herself despite intentionally slowing to 6:20 pace.&nbsp; She accomplished her goal, winning comfortably in 38:59.04.&nbsp; The real surprise came when Bailee Margolis '19 put herself up towards the front early, then stayed there despite one of her shoes getting pulled off.&nbsp; Margolis was putting down consistent miles of 6:12, 6:14&nbsp;and 6:15, when she was feeling the discomfort of running with just one shoe.&nbsp; She stopped and put her shoe back on, only losing four seconds in the process, and worked her way back to third.&nbsp; In the final mile she started pulling away, eventually earning an unexpected second place in 39:14.66.&nbsp; The 18 points gave the women 39 points for day one.</p>
              <p>Day two temperature was cooler at 80 degrees, but sunny with no cloud cover.&nbsp; The wind was still pretty strong throughout the day.</p>
              <p>If the Engineers could maintain their edge after having such a successful start they would be well on their way to defending their title.&nbsp; That question was answered in the first final event of the day, the 3,000 Steeplechase.&nbsp; In the&nbsp;women's race, Jenna Melanson '20, the solid favorite, decided the first lap pace of 87 seconds was not getting it done for her so she dropped an 83 on the field, essentially ending the race.&nbsp; The sophomore All American cruised home in 10:49.00 to win by 24 seconds.&nbsp; She is 12th on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p>Aidan Gilson '19, the favorite in the men's race, tried the same maneuver as Melanson, but did not gain the separation he was hoping for.&nbsp; In the final lap he was not able to kick it in and got passed in the final 200.&nbsp; He was able to run&nbsp;a season best 9:24.47.&nbsp; Seeded to score 13 points, MIT was not satisfied with that total.&nbsp; Ben Freed '18 ran a great season best of 9:29.42 for third place&nbsp;and Brian Bates '20 came out of his season long funk at the right time to earn fourth with an impressive PR of 9:31.70.&nbsp; The 19 points sent MIT on their way and they would not be stopped.</p>
              <p>Athletes exceeding their seeds continued to happen for MIT throughout the day.&nbsp; In the High Jump, Margaret Redfield '21 cleared 5-3 3/4 to earn an unexpected sixth place and establish a Freshman Record.&nbsp; For a little icing on top, Liana Reilly '21 added an eighth place by clearing 5-2 1/2 on her first attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;MIT expected zero points, so the 4 points scored were a pleasant surprise.</p>
              <p>Jasmine Jin '20 continuing her wonderful improvement this year, placed third in the Triple Jump with a personal best of 38-1 1/4.&nbsp; Elizabeth Weeks '21, placed sixth with a 37-8 performance, giving her the Freshman Record.&nbsp; Again MIT scored two more points than expected.</p>
              <p>Slutsky surprisingly lost the Hammer Throw competition,&nbsp;placing second despite throwing 168-5, but she made up for the two points lost by earning an unexpected sixth place in the Shot Put, throwing 39-3 1/4.&nbsp; Jebutu did not score in the Hammer, but did throw a significant PR of 145-2.</p>
              <p>The vaulters seem to always come through for the Engineers and that rang true in this championship as well.&nbsp; Kari Stromhaug '19 led her teammates to a 2-4-5-7 finish&nbsp;for 19 points.&nbsp; Stromhaug cleared 12-3 1/2.</p>
              <p>The track performances were just as impressive.&nbsp; Hannah Chen '18 had quite the day.&nbsp; The senior All American ran 14.62 for a season best for fourth place after running a PR of 14.42 in the trials the day before.&nbsp; However, the 14.42 will not count towards NCAA qualifying as the wind reading was a little too strong.&nbsp; Chen came back in the 400IH to earn second place with a season best of 61.14, which is fifth on the NCAA list.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The middle-distance group did more than hold their own.&nbsp; The 800 and 1500 runners were only seeded to score a total of 10 points.&nbsp; Katie Bacher '20 and Marissa McPhillips '20 took care of that in just the 1500.&nbsp; Bacher ran a 73 third quarter followed by a 52 final 300 to place second in a PR 3:33.98.&nbsp; McPhillips, looking like she might get third fell off in the final twenty meters, placing sixth in 4:35.91.&nbsp; In the 800, Bailey Tregoning '19, returning to her racing level after dealing with various injuries for the past year, ran a perfect race to place second in 2:11.18.&nbsp; Margaret Trautner '20 added a sixth place in the fast field with her 2:14.33 and Katie Williams '21 placed eighth in 2:14.58.&nbsp; All three were season bests.&nbsp; The two events netted MIT 23 points.</p>
              <p>Michelle Menkiti '20, missing the past meet with a pulled hamstring, was able to come back and race the 200.&nbsp; Seeded to get one point when totally healthy, the sophomore ran a season best 25.09 to place fourth and earn five points for her team.</p>
              <p>MIT ended the women's meet in grand style.&nbsp; Eccles, wanting a quality race even though her points were no longer needed, placed second in the 5K with a fine 17:31.05.</p>
              <p>McPhillips, Skylar Brooks '20, Bacher and Trautner combined to win the 4x800 relay going away.&nbsp; Leading from the start, McPhillips ran 2:17.2.&nbsp; Brooks, all alone throughout her leg, ran 2:22.8.&nbsp; Bacher expanded the lead with a 2:19.8 and Trautner put it away with a 2:18.6 for a combined time of 9:20.69.</p>
              <p>Kristen Frombach '19 led off the 4x400 Relay with a 60.6, giving MIT a slight lead.&nbsp; Chen, running her third race of the day, split 57.4 to give her team a solid lead.&nbsp; Katie Williams maintained a lead with a 59.4, but Colby College was closing quickly.&nbsp; When Tregoning received the baton she was able to maintain the inside lane but the two teams were essentially even.&nbsp; Tregoning held her opponent on the outside throughout the turn, but lost the lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the final 150 Tregoning's 800 endurance started to show as she gradually closed the lead.&nbsp; At the finish she took the lead to win in 3:56.01.</p>
              <p>The men also thrived after the Steeplechase.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shaoul and Ruschel show was back on in the Triple Jump.&nbsp; Both opened with 48-3 efforts on their first jump, securing first and second place right then and there.&nbsp; Shaoul jumped 49-5 on his third jump to take the lead for good and establish a Freshman Record.&nbsp; On his final attempt Ruschel jumped 48-4 1/2.&nbsp; The pair are ranked fourth and 10th respectively on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p>Bratten continued his success&nbsp;in the Shot Put.&nbsp; He&nbsp;was seeded sixth, but threw his second PR in two weeks,&nbsp;earning third place with a 50-9 3/4&nbsp;performance.</p>
              <p>In the High Jump, Chris Washington '20 earned a third place with a clear at 6-7.&nbsp; Teammate Alec Reduker '20, fighting lower back problems, cleared 6-5 to tie for seventh place.&nbsp; The seven and a half points were not quite what Tech was seeded to score, but with Reduker's back problems it was more than they thought they would get from the event.</p>
              <p>Scott Cameron '19 defended his individual pole vault title, clearing 15-9 in a jump-off.&nbsp; Everett Brandyberry '21 continued his exceptional freshman championship season, clearing 14-5 1/4 to place sixth.</p>
              <p>The success on the track for the Engineers was mostly due to Chris Sweeney '18 and Benton Wilson '21.&nbsp; The senior won the 110HH in 14.80, a day after running a PR of 14.73 in the trials.&nbsp; Sweeney came back in the 400IH with another PR, running 53.42, but finishing in second place.&nbsp; He is ranked 17th nationally in the 400IH.&nbsp; He will likely need to get under 53 seconds to remain among the top 20, which is the number of men selected for each individual event.</p>
              <p>Wilson, the freshman record holder in both the 100 and 200 for MIT, fought off his shin splint&nbsp;pain and delivered a fourth place in the 100 with a 10.87 and a fifth place in the 200 with&nbsp;a 21.91.</p>
              <p>The men performed similar to the women, closing the meet out with a strong statement.&nbsp; Rosenkranz sat on the leaders, perhaps a little too long, and was unable to match their closing speed.&nbsp; Running 1:40 in the final 600 meters, Rosenkranz was only able to manage third place in 14:53.04, a pretty impressive double coming back from his 10K victory.&nbsp; Billy Woltz '20 added a PR 15:03.63 to finish sixth and add three more points.</p>
              <p>In the 4x800 Relay, Nathan Munet '19 returned from the open 800 to run a 1:55.2 leadoff leg.&nbsp; Dylan Doblar '21 coming back from the 1500, split 1:58.8.&nbsp; Ellery Rajagopal '21 ran 2:00.3 to keep his team in second place.&nbsp; Simon Alford '20, two weeks after returning from injury, ran 1:56.0 to secure a second place in year best 7:50.66.</p>
              <p>The final event&nbsp;was the 4x400 Relay.&nbsp; MIT, seeded eighth, believed they could do better than that.&nbsp; Sweeney came back for his third race.&nbsp; He was placed in lane eight, which when you run a three-turn stagger, is in no-man's land.&nbsp; He did not match his best, but still split a respectable 51.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilson working on his speed, delivered a 51.6.&nbsp; Ken Acquah '20, running fresh, dropped a huge PR of 49.9 to bring his team into contention despite having to dodge people in getting the baton and in handing off.&nbsp; Benton Wilson ran an excellent 49.0 anchor to put MIT in sixth place in a season best 3:21.97.</p>
              <p>The Engineers will now focus on the NCAA Division III Championship&nbsp;in three weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two weeks provide excellent competitive opportunities for individuals to improve their marks.&nbsp; Next weekend MIT will travel to Dartmouth College for the NEICAAA Championship, the New England Championship for Division I, II and III colleges.&nbsp; The week after that MIT will host the NCAA New England Region Final Qualifier.              </p>
