        This past Saturday , the MIT Men's Track and Field Team made the trip to 
    Brunswick, Maine to face the top three Division III Teams from Maine, Bates,
    Bowdoin, and Colby.  Tech was not only as injured as they were last week, but
    were also without the services of Andrew Jamieson '99 because of illness, and 
    Akin Aina '96 because of a family matter.
        Once again, it did not seem likely that MIT would emerge victorious.  
    However, due to somoe clutch performances and the opponents balancing out each
    other's strengths and weaknesses.  This was indicated in the score (MIT 69, 
    Bates 48, Colby 46, and Bowdoin 44).  MIT scored in all but one event (100 
    meter dash), and secured at least a 2nd place in 13 of the 18 other events.
        Coming through the biggest for MIT was Co-captain John Wallberg '96, who 
    won 3 events; the Hammer in 186-4, the Discus in a personal best 152-5, and the
    Shot Put in 45-3.  This was especially significant because Bates scored the
    remaining points in those three events except for a third by George Torres '99
    in the Discus with a personal best of 130-9, qualifying him for the NE Division
    III Championships in three weeks.  
        Many others contributed key performances.  One was Morio Alexander '96, who
    came from behind in both the Long Jump and the Triple Jump to nab 2nd and 1st 
    places respectively.  Morio also was a last minute replacememt for Aina in the
    victorious 400 Relay. 
        Neal Karchem '99, placed 2nd in the 400, but nailed down the victory in the
    200 meters with a personal and team best of 23.27.  Neal was also a key figure
    in both the 400 Relay which finished 1st and the 1600 Relay which finished 2nd.
        The other Co-captain, Hung Hoang '96, also came through with come from 
    behind points in the Long and Triple Jumps, earning 3rd and 2nd respectively.
    Hung also came away with a 4th place in the High Jump.
        Once again the 1-2 punch in the middle-distances of Dan Helgesen '97, and 
    Joel Ford '98 was a major threat as the pair went 2-3 in the 800 meters and 
    3-4 in the 1500 meters.  Joel added a great leg in the 1600 Relay.
        The meet was still in question with three events to go.  Freshman Mike
    Parkins, still fatigued from his 2nd place time of 9:41.5 in the 3000
    Steeplechase, double back in the 5000 with the hope of scoring a potentially
    necessary point or two.  It was not until the 5000 was over and the results of
    the Triple Jump were announced, and it appeared obvious that Wallberg would win
    the Discus, that Coach Halston Taylor knew the victory was in hand.
        Next week the Track Team goes across town to meet Tufts and Bates in what 
    will undoubtedly be the most difficult meet of the season.  Coach Taylor feels
    that if the Techmen can get healthy, they will have a chance against a very
    good Tufts team.  
    
    



    
    
    
    
    ### TRACK TEAM CONTINUES DOMINANCE IN ENGINEER'S CUP
    
    
    
    	This past Saturday, MIT Men's Track Team continued it's dominance in 
    the Engineer's Cup against RPI and WPI.  MIT has never lost this meet and was 
    never in jeopardy of doing so on Saturday, although that was not the feeling 
    going into the meet.
    	MIT has some devastating injuries, and expected a much stronger effort
    from their competition because of it.  Missing from competition are Indoor MVP,
    Ravi Sastry '98, who does all of the jumps and hurdle events, IC4A competitors,
    Dafe Ogagan '97 in the Pole Vault and High Hurdles, and Dan Helgesen '97 in the
    1500 and 800, as well as Josh Feldman '97 in the 5000.  Coach Taylor figures 
    the Engineers are giving up ~30 points, a luxury he did not think they could 
    afford.  
    	The meet began with John Wallberg '96 picking up where he left off last
    year, winning the Hammer with a national qualifying throw of 180-01.  Wade 
    Morehead '98 added a personal best throw of 135-01 for 3rd place.  Another 
    early event, the Long Jump saw MIT sweep the first three places with efforts of
    20-04 1/2 by Morio Alexander '96, 20-02 3/4 by Akin Aina '96, and 19-09 1/2 by
    Hung Hoang '96.  This early success was built on once the running events began.
    Freshmen Mike Parkins, and Leif Seed went 1-3 in the 3000 Steeplechase with 
    bests of 9:43.0, and 9:55.6, and Joel Ford '98 and Arnold Seto '96 followed 
    with another 1-3 in the 1500, with times of 4:06.5 and 4:08.9 respectively.
    	RPI and WPI never appeared to think that they could win, as they did 
    not double their best runners back in other events.  However, even facing fresh
    runners did not phase the MIT athletes, as they continued to win events.  
    Wallberg also won the Discus and Shot Put with throws of 141-7 and 45-1 
    respectively.  Seto won the 5000 in 16:06 and was followed closely by Omar 
    Saleh '97 with a remarkable run of 16:08.  Freshman Neal Karchem won the 400 in
    a personal best of 51.54 and anchored the 1600 Relay Team to a come from behind
    victory.  Other place winners were Aina in the 100 (11.71) for 3rd and 2nd in 
    the 200 (23.29),  Lincoln Bonner '97 in the High Hurdles (15.98) for 2nd, and 
    3rd in the 200 (23.53), Bo Light '96 was 3rd in the 110HH (16.98), 4th in the 
    400IH (60.22), and 3rd in the High Jump (5-10), Marlon Osbourne '98 with a 4th 
    in the 400 (52.58), Seed with a debut of 60.03 in the 400IH for 3rd, Martin 
    Suresh '99 with a 3rd in the 800 (2:03.05), Keith Bevans '96 for 3rd in the 
    Shot Put (44-03), Alexander and Hoang for 2nd and 3rd in the Triple Jump 
    (41-10 1/2, 41-4), Hoang for 4th in the High Jump (5-10), Mike DeMassa '97 for 
    4th in the Pole Vault (12-06), and Juan Carlos Fuenmayor - Soto '97 for 3rd in 
    the Javelin (139-9).
    	Next week the Engineers travel to Bowdoin for a meet with Bowdoin, 
    Bates, and Colby.  Bates is very strong in the throws and Bowdoin strong in the
    Distance events.  With the current injury situation, a lot of individuals will
    have to step up a little sooner than was intended.  
    



    
    
    
    
    ## TRACK TEAM COMES THROUGH BIG IN CHAMPIONSHIPS
    
    
        The MIT track team made the cross state trip to Williams College this 
    weekend with the expectations of bettering their 5th place seed in the New
    England Division III Championships.  Not only did they accoomplish this, but 
    they finished 2nd with 58 points and an incredible 14 personal bests.
        The meet could not have begun better for Tech, as Arnie Seto '96 set a 1:19
    personal best in the 10,000 Meters, placing 4th with a 31:09.38 in what may 
    have been the best race of the day.  Arnie and 4 other runners in the race 
    qualified provisionally for nationals.
        The next event was the Hammer, an event in which even though John Wallberg
    '96 has won two of the last three championships, he was seeded second behind
    Ethan Brooks of Williams.  Ethan has never beaten John and nothing changed on
    this day as John threw a personal best of 194-00 to win and set a championship 
    record.
        The trials in the running events went better than anyone on the MIT Team 
    could hope for.  Neal Karchem '99, seeded 14th in the 400, qualified 7th to 
    make the final with a personal best of 50.84.  
        In the 110 High Hurdles, Tech had 3 entries.  Two of the three, Ravi Sastry
    '98 seeded 10th, and Lincoln Bonner '97 seeded 6th, made the final, although it
    was the final 2 positions at 7th and 8th.
        MIT did not have an entry in the 100 Meters, but the 400 Intermediate 
    Hurdles had "Bo" Light '96 seeded 13th, hoping for a successful final 
    opportunity at trying to place in The Outdoor Championship.  Bo came through as
    marvelously as the others, placing 2nd in his heat in a huge personal best of 
    57.31 and qualifying for the finals.
        In the next event, the 800 Meters, Dan Helgesen '97 seeded 10th, ran a 2 
    second best of 1:56.44 to also make the next round.
        Only one MIT runner failed to make the finals, although only 1 was seeded
    to do so.  Things were on a roll, and Tech could not wait until the final
    would begin.
        While all of this was going on, the field events were continuing.  In the 
    Long Jump, MIT had 3 entries, but none were seeded higher than 10th.  Well, 
    the magic continued.  Morio Alexander '96 had a 7 inch personal best to garner
    5th place with a 21-06 3/4 jump.  Hung Hoang '96 and Sastry jumped 20-08, and
    20-05 1/4, but could not place.
        The Discus and High Jump were the only events that did not go MIT's way.  
    Wallberg did not have a good day in the continuous downpour, and did not make
    the finals.  Hoang had an equally poor performance has he no heighted.
        With the fear that the momentum was fading away, particularly since most of
    the MIT finalists were 7th or 8th and may not score in the finals, Coach 
    Halston Taylor did all he could not to show concern.  Fortunately, the first
    running event final was the 3000 Meter Steeplechase.  
        Even though it is Coach Taylor's philosophy not to count on freshmen, that 
    is exactly what he did.  Leif Seed '99 and Mike Parkins '99, came through in 
    a big way.  Both broke the freshman record, placing 2nd and 3rd respectively
    with times of 9:25.68 and 9:30.57.  Leif, missing national qualifying by 2
    seconds, was seeded 8th and Parkins 5th.
        The 400 Relay was up next.  Due to injuries during the season, the relay
    team had gone through 4 different combinations.  Seeded 8th, Tech ran a 
    flawless race in the rain and placed 5th with a season best of 43.79.
        In the 1500 Meters, Joel Ford represented MIT, but was in the slow section.
    Joel ran a season best of 4:05.97, but was not able to break into the scorers.
        Now it was time to see if the finalists would put their hard training to
    use and improve, yet again, on their finals position.  Sastry and Bonner were
    the first to try their fortunes.  Sastry came through with a personal best of
    15.80 to earn 6th place and 1 point.
        Next, Karchem showed that the freshmen would continue to hold up their
    end of the bargain, placing 5th with a time of 51.18.
        In the 800 Meters, Helgesen went out very conservatively in 59.0 at the 400
    mark.  However, he negative split the race, running another 1:56 to move up to
    5th.
        Perhaps the biggest long shot of the day had been Bo Light in the 400IH.  
    Probably only Coach Taylor, and Light himself expected even more results.  Bo
    did not disappoint, running 57.51 to earn 6th place and contribute yet another
    point to the cause.
        With only 4 events remaining (Triple Jump, Pole Vault, Shot Put, and 1600 
    Relay) MIT was in 2nd place, but only by 2 points.  Hoang came through with a
    great 6 jump series.  Hung went back and forth from 2nd to 5th through the
    last jump.  Hung went from 5th to 2nd on his last jump, but got passed yet one
    more time to end up with 3rd at 43-7 3/4.
        Wallberg came back in the Shot Put, an event he was seeded 6th in, to place
    4th with a 46 foot put.  John was the high scorer for MIT with 12 points.
        The 1600 Meter Relay was seeded to run in the slower section, but a scratch
    moved them up to the fast section.  Akin Aina '96, Marlon Osbourne '98, Seed,
    and Karchem made the most of their opportunity.  Aina, running only his 2nd
    400 of the year, led off with a 52.4 leg.  Osbourne continued his remarkable
    improvement and ran a 51.2 400, moving MIT up to a pack of 4 in 3rd place.
    Seed, psyched up from his 18 second PR in the Steeplechase, ran his season 
    best, a 52.1 leg, moving MIT up to the lone team in 3rd.  Karchem ran his 3rd
    400 of the day in 51.6, but succumbed to 1 runner, finishing in 4th for 4
    points and a seaon best time of 3:27.39.
        With the Pole Vault remaining, MIT had secured 2nd place with 52 points to
    Springfield College's 50 points.  Andrew Jamieson '99 did his best to join the
    corp of freshmen contributing points, but finished 1 place out of the money.  
    Andrew jumped a personal best of 13-09, but the field was of high quality, and
    on this day that would not be enough.  Dafe Ogagan '97, finally back from his 
    injury, cleared 14-09 to tie his best.  Dafe was over 15-03, but displaced the 
    bar, settling for 3rd place.
        Next week, MIT travels back to Williamstown for the All New England
    Championships.  Hoping to join Wallberg and Seto at nationals will be Ogagan,
    Seed, and Parkins.  This will be the last meet before The National 
    Championships.
    



        
        
        
        
        ## MIT TRACK REMAINS UNDEFEATED
        
        
        
            This past Saturday , the MIT Men's Track and Field Team made the trip to 
        Brunswick, Maine to face the top three Division III Teams from Maine, Bates,
        Bowdoin, and Colby.  Tech was not only as injured as they were last week, but
        were also without the services of Andrew Jamieson '99 because of illness, and 
        Akin Aina '96 because of a family matter.
            Once again, it did not seem likely that MIT would emerge victorious.  
        However, due to somoe clutch performances and the opponents balancing out each
        other's strengths and weaknesses.  This was indicated in the score (MIT 69, 
        Bates 48, Colby 46, and Bowdoin 44).  MIT scored in all but one event (100 
        meter dash), and secured at least a 2nd place in 13 of the 18 other events.
            Coming through the biggest for MIT was Co-captain John Wallberg '96, who 
        won 3 events; the Hammer in 186-4, the Discus in a personal best 152-5, and the
        Shot Put in 45-3.  This was especially significant because Bates scored the
        remaining points in those three events except for a third by George Torres '99
        in the Discus with a personal best of 130-9, qualifying him for the NE Division
        III Championships in three weeks.  
            Many others contributed key performances.  One was Morio Alexander '96, who
        came from behind in both the Long Jump and the Triple Jump to nab 2nd and 1st 
        places respectively.  Morio also was a last minute replacememt for Aina in the
        victorious 400 Relay. 
            Neal Karchem '99, placed 2nd in the 400, but nailed down the victory in the
        200 meters with a personal and team best of 23.27.  Neal was also a key figure
        in both the 400 Relay which finished 1st and the 1600 Relay which finished 2nd.
            The other Co-captain, Hung Hoang '96, also came through with come from 
        behind points in the Long and Triple Jumps, earning 3rd and 2nd respectively.
        Hung also came away with a 4th place in the High Jump.
            Once again the 1-2 punch in the middle-distances of Dan Helgesen '97, and 
        Joel Ford '98 was a major threat as the pair went 2-3 in the 800 meters and 
        3-4 in the 1500 meters.  Joel added a great leg in the 1600 Relay.
            The meet was still in question with three events to go.  Freshman Mike
        Parkins, still fatigued from his 2nd place time of 9:41.5 in the 3000
        Steeplechase, double back in the 5000 with the hope of scoring a potentially
        necessary point or two.  It was not until the 5000 was over and the results of
        the Triple Jump were announced, and it appeared obvious that Wallberg would win
        the Discus, that Coach Halston Taylor knew the victory was in hand.
            Next week the Track Team goes across town to meet Tufts and Bates in what 
        will undoubtedly be the most difficult meet of the season.  Coach Taylor feels
        that if the Techmen can get healthy, they will have a chance against a very
        good Tufts team.  
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        ### TRACK TEAM CONTINUES DOMINANCE IN ENGINEER'S CUP
        
        
        
        	This past Saturday, MIT Men's Track Team continued it's dominance in 
        the Engineer's Cup against RPI and WPI.  MIT has never lost this meet and was 
        never in jeopardy of doing so on Saturday, although that was not the feeling 
        going into the meet.
        	MIT has some devastating injuries, and expected a much stronger effort
        from their competition because of it.  Missing from competition are Indoor MVP,
        Ravi Sastry '98, who does all of the jumps and hurdle events, IC4A competitors,
        Dafe Ogagan '97 in the Pole Vault and High Hurdles, and Dan Helgesen '97 in the
        1500 and 800, as well as Josh Feldman '97 in the 5000.  Coach Taylor figures 
        the Engineers are giving up ~30 points, a luxury he did not think they could 
        afford.  
        	The meet began with John Wallberg '96 picking up where he left off last
        year, winning the Hammer with a national qualifying throw of 180-01.  Wade 
        Morehead '98 added a personal best throw of 135-01 for 3rd place.  Another 
        early event, the Long Jump saw MIT sweep the first three places with efforts of
        20-04 1/2 by Morio Alexander '96, 20-02 3/4 by Akin Aina '96, and 19-09 1/2 by
        Hung Hoang '96.  This early success was built on once the running events began.
        Freshmen Mike Parkins, and Leif Seed went 1-3 in the 3000 Steeplechase with 
        bests of 9:43.0, and 9:55.6, and Joel Ford '98 and Arnold Seto '96 followed 
        with another 1-3 in the 1500, with times of 4:06.5 and 4:08.9 respectively.
        	RPI and WPI never appeared to think that they could win, as they did 
        not double their best runners back in other events.  However, even facing fresh
        runners did not phase the MIT athletes, as they continued to win events.  
        Wallberg also won the Discus and Shot Put with throws of 141-7 and 45-1 
        respectively.  Seto won the 5000 in 16:06 and was followed closely by Omar 
        Saleh '97 with a remarkable run of 16:08.  Freshman Neal Karchem won the 400 in
        a personal best of 51.54 and anchored the 1600 Relay Team to a come from behind
        victory.  Other place winners were Aina in the 100 (11.71) for 3rd and 2nd in 
        the 200 (23.29),  Lincoln Bonner '97 in the High Hurdles (15.98) for 2nd, and 
        3rd in the 200 (23.53), Bo Light '96 was 3rd in the 110HH (16.98), 4th in the 
        400IH (60.22), and 3rd in the High Jump (5-10), Marlon Osbourne '98 with a 4th 
        in the 400 (52.58), Seed with a debut of 60.03 in the 400IH for 3rd, Martin 
        Suresh '99 with a 3rd in the 800 (2:03.05), Keith Bevans '96 for 3rd in the 
        Shot Put (44-03), Alexander and Hoang for 2nd and 3rd in the Triple Jump 
        (41-10 1/2, 41-4), Hoang for 4th in the High Jump (5-10), Mike DeMassa '97 for 
        4th in the Pole Vault (12-06), and Juan Carlos Fuenmayor - Soto '97 for 3rd in 
        the Javelin (139-9).
        	Next week the Engineers travel to Bowdoin for a meet with Bowdoin, 
        Bates, and Colby.  Bates is very strong in the throws and Bowdoin strong in the
        Distance events.  With the current injury situation, a lot of individuals will
        have to step up a little sooner than was intended.  
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        ## TRACK TEAM COMES THROUGH BIG IN CHAMPIONSHIPS
        
        
            The MIT track team made the cross state trip to Williams College this 
        weekend with the expectations of bettering their 5th place seed in the New
        England Division III Championships.  Not only did they accoomplish this, but 
        they finished 2nd with 58 points and an incredible 14 personal bests.
            The meet could not have begun better for Tech, as Arnie Seto '96 set a 1:19
        personal best in the 10,000 Meters, placing 4th with a 31:09.38 in what may 
        have been the best race of the day.  Arnie and 4 other runners in the race 
        qualified provisionally for nationals.
            The next event was the Hammer, an event in which even though John Wallberg
        '96 has won two of the last three championships, he was seeded second behind
        Ethan Brooks of Williams.  Ethan has never beaten John and nothing changed on
        this day as John threw a personal best of 194-00 to win and set a championship 
        record.
            The trials in the running events went better than anyone on the MIT Team 
        could hope for.  Neal Karchem '99, seeded 14th in the 400, qualified 7th to 
        make the final with a personal best of 50.84.  
            In the 110 High Hurdles, Tech had 3 entries.  Two of the three, Ravi Sastry
        '98 seeded 10th, and Lincoln Bonner '97 seeded 6th, made the final, although it
        was the final 2 positions at 7th and 8th.
            MIT did not have an entry in the 100 Meters, but the 400 Intermediate 
        Hurdles had "Bo" Light '96 seeded 13th, hoping for a successful final 
        opportunity at trying to place in The Outdoor Championship.  Bo came through as
        marvelously as the others, placing 2nd in his heat in a huge personal best of 
        57.31 and qualifying for the finals.
            In the next event, the 800 Meters, Dan Helgesen '97 seeded 10th, ran a 2 
        second best of 1:56.44 to also make the next round.
            Only one MIT runner failed to make the finals, although only 1 was seeded
        to do so.  Things were on a roll, and Tech could not wait until the final
        would begin.
            While all of this was going on, the field events were continuing.  In the 
        Long Jump, MIT had 3 entries, but none were seeded higher than 10th.  Well, 
        the magic continued.  Morio Alexander '96 had a 7 inch personal best to garner
        5th place with a 21-06 3/4 jump.  Hung Hoang '96 and Sastry jumped 20-08, and
        20-05 1/4, but could not place.
            The Discus and High Jump were the only events that did not go MIT's way.  
        Wallberg did not have a good day in the continuous downpour, and did not make
        the finals.  Hoang had an equally poor performance has he no heighted.
            With the fear that the momentum was fading away, particularly since most of
        the MIT finalists were 7th or 8th and may not score in the finals, Coach 
        Halston Taylor did all he could not to show concern.  Fortunately, the first
        running event final was the 3000 Meter Steeplechase.  
            Even though it is Coach Taylor's philosophy not to count on freshmen, that 
        is exactly what he did.  Leif Seed '99 and Mike Parkins '99, came through in 
        a big way.  Both broke the freshman record, placing 2nd and 3rd respectively
        with times of 9:25.68 and 9:30.57.  Leif, missing national qualifying by 2
        seconds, was seeded 8th and Parkins 5th.
            The 400 Relay was up next.  Due to injuries during the season, the relay
        team had gone through 4 different combinations.  Seeded 8th, Tech ran a 
        flawless race in the rain and placed 5th with a season best of 43.79.
            In the 1500 Meters, Joel Ford represented MIT, but was in the slow section.
        Joel ran a season best of 4:05.97, but was not able to break into the scorers.
            Now it was time to see if the finalists would put their hard training to
        use and improve, yet again, on their finals position.  Sastry and Bonner were
        the first to try their fortunes.  Sastry came through with a personal best of
        15.80 to earn 6th place and 1 point.
            Next, Karchem showed that the freshmen would continue to hold up their
        end of the bargain, placing 5th with a time of 51.18.
            In the 800 Meters, Helgesen went out very conservatively in 59.0 at the 400
        mark.  However, he negative split the race, running another 1:56 to move up to
        5th.
            Perhaps the biggest long shot of the day had been Bo Light in the 400IH.  
        Probably only Coach Taylor, and Light himself expected even more results.  Bo
        did not disappoint, running 57.51 to earn 6th place and contribute yet another
        point to the cause.
            With only 4 events remaining (Triple Jump, Pole Vault, Shot Put, and 1600 
        Relay) MIT was in 2nd place, but only by 2 points.  Hoang came through with a
        great 6 jump series.  Hung went back and forth from 2nd to 5th through the
        last jump.  Hung went from 5th to 2nd on his last jump, but got passed yet one
        more time to end up with 3rd at 43-7 3/4.
            Wallberg came back in the Shot Put, an event he was seeded 6th in, to place
        4th with a 46 foot put.  John was the high scorer for MIT with 12 points.
            The 1600 Meter Relay was seeded to run in the slower section, but a scratch
        moved them up to the fast section.  Akin Aina '96, Marlon Osbourne '98, Seed,
        and Karchem made the most of their opportunity.  Aina, running only his 2nd
        400 of the year, led off with a 52.4 leg.  Osbourne continued his remarkable
        improvement and ran a 51.2 400, moving MIT up to a pack of 4 in 3rd place.
        Seed, psyched up from his 18 second PR in the Steeplechase, ran his season 
        best, a 52.1 leg, moving MIT up to the lone team in 3rd.  Karchem ran his 3rd
        400 of the day in 51.6, but succumbed to 1 runner, finishing in 4th for 4
        points and a seaon best time of 3:27.39.
            With the Pole Vault remaining, MIT had secured 2nd place with 52 points to
        Springfield College's 50 points.  Andrew Jamieson '99 did his best to join the
        corp of freshmen contributing points, but finished 1 place out of the money.  
        Andrew jumped a personal best of 13-09, but the field was of high quality, and
        on this day that would not be enough.  Dafe Ogagan '97, finally back from his 
        injury, cleared 14-09 to tie his best.  Dafe was over 15-03, but displaced the 
        bar, settling for 3rd place.
            Next week, MIT travels back to Williamstown for the All New England
        Championships.  Hoping to join Wallberg and Seto at nationals will be Ogagan,
        Seed, and Parkins.  This will be the last meet before The National 
        Championships.
