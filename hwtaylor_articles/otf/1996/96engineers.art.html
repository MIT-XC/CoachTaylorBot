<h3><center>TRACK TEAM CONTINUES DOMINANCE IN ENGINEER'S CUP</center></h3>

	This past Saturday, MIT Men's Track Team continued it's dominance in 
the Engineer's Cup against RPI and WPI.  MIT has never lost this meet and was 
never in jeopardy of doing so on Saturday, although that was not the feeling 
going into the meet.
	MIT has some devastating injuries, and expected a much stronger effort
from their competition because of it.  Missing from competition are Indoor MVP,
Ravi Sastry '98, who does all of the jumps and hurdle events, IC4A competitors,
Dafe Ogagan '97 in the Pole Vault and High Hurdles, and Dan Helgesen '97 in the
1500 and 800, as well as Josh Feldman '97 in the 5000.  Coach Taylor figures 
the Engineers are giving up ~30 points, a luxury he did not think they could 
afford.  
	The meet began with John Wallberg '96 picking up where he left off last
year, winning the Hammer with a national qualifying throw of 180-01.  Wade 
Morehead '98 added a personal best throw of 135-01 for 3rd place.  Another 
early event, the Long Jump saw MIT sweep the first three places with efforts of
20-04 1/2 by Morio Alexander '96, 20-02 3/4 by Akin Aina '96, and 19-09 1/2 by
Hung Hoang '96.  This early success was built on once the running events began.
Freshmen Mike Parkins, and Leif Seed went 1-3 in the 3000 Steeplechase with 
bests of 9:43.0, and 9:55.6, and Joel Ford '98 and Arnold Seto '96 followed 
with another 1-3 in the 1500, with times of 4:06.5 and 4:08.9 respectively.
	RPI and WPI never appeared to think that they could win, as they did 
not double their best runners back in other events.  However, even facing fresh
runners did not phase the MIT athletes, as they continued to win events.  
Wallberg also won the Discus and Shot Put with throws of 141-7 and 45-1 
respectively.  Seto won the 5000 in 16:06 and was followed closely by Omar 
Saleh '97 with a remarkable run of 16:08.  Freshman Neal Karchem won the 400 in
a personal best of 51.54 and anchored the 1600 Relay Team to a come from behind
victory.  Other place winners were Aina in the 100 (11.71) for 3rd and 2nd in 
the 200 (23.29),  Lincoln Bonner '97 in the High Hurdles (15.98) for 2nd, and 
3rd in the 200 (23.53), Bo Light '96 was 3rd in the 110HH (16.98), 4th in the 
400IH (60.22), and 3rd in the High Jump (5-10), Marlon Osbourne '98 with a 4th 
in the 400 (52.58), Seed with a debut of 60.03 in the 400IH for 3rd, Martin 
Suresh '99 with a 3rd in the 800 (2:03.05), Keith Bevans '96 for 3rd in the 
Shot Put (44-03), Alexander and Hoang for 2nd and 3rd in the Triple Jump 
(41-10 1/2, 41-4), Hoang for 4th in the High Jump (5-10), Mike DeMassa '97 for 
4th in the Pole Vault (12-06), and Juan Carlos Fuenmayor - Soto '97 for 3rd in 
the Javelin (139-9).
	Next week the Engineers travel to Bowdoin for a meet with Bowdoin, 
Bates, and Colby.  Bates is very strong in the throws and Bowdoin strong in the
Distance events.  With the current injury situation, a lot of individuals will
have to step up a little sooner than was intended.
