              <p><strong><span class="style4">Three Varsity Records Highlight Meet for Women </span></strong></p>
              <p> March 28, 2009 </p>
              <p align="left">MIT Men's and Women's Track and Field teams both placed second at the <a href="plnu.res.html">Point Loma Nazarene University Spring Invitational</a>. The men finished second with 285.5 in the twelve team meet behind Azusa Pacific with 313.5, although a scoring errors in the shot put and triple jump provided Azusa Pacific with a larger margin than it actually had. The women scored 267.5 to Point Loma's 303. Both teams representing the Engineers were only represented by approximately half the team as the cost of the week long spring trip to California precludes bringing more individuals.</p>
              <p align="left">The scoring awarded points to the top 14 places in each event, but no more than two individuals could score per team per event. The awarded points for first place was 15 points and then 13 for second decreasing by one point increments to one point for 14th place.</p>
              <p align="left">For the women, Jacqui Wentz '10, was the only double winner, taking the 3000 Steeplechase in a personal best of 11:00.30, which provisionally qualified her for the NCAA Division III Championship. A couple  hours later she came back in the 800 with a 2:18.69. </p>
              <p align="left">Emily Hwang '09, winner in the pole vault had the other NCAA provisional qualifying mark with a 12-0 3/4 vault. She narrowly missed making 12-6. Her mark also set the MIT varsity record. </p>
              <p align="left">Two more varsity records and one freshman record were also recorded by the women's team. The 4x100 team sprinted their way to a 49.47 record despite two pretty poor handoffs. The quartet of Margaret Leibovic '10, Jamie Simmons '12, Portia Jones '12, and Amy Magnuson '10 have the potential to get into the 48s this year. Andrea Bradshaw '09, Martha Gross '12, Simmons and Jones smashed the existing MIT record by six seconds, running a 3:58.35. This record should also drop some more by season's end. Simmons had quite the impact on the track team in her first meet as she also set the freshman record in the 400IH with a 65.62, barely nipping Jones in her 400IH debut of 65.64.</p>
              <p align="left">Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, after running a nice personal record in the 1500 in 4:43.58 to place second,  came back to win the 5000 in 17:59.21, running just fast enough to win.</p>
              <p align="left">In the men's meet, Mattias Flander '11, was one of three victors for MIT, claiming the triple jump with a 44-11 effort. The results mixed up the first and third place, placing Flander in third incorrectly.</p>
              <p align="left">Paul Welle '11, earned the 3000 Steeplechase victory for the second consecutive year. Welle's time of 9:40.68 just outkicked a competitor from the host school as well as his teammate, Richard Prevost '11.</p>
              <p align="left">Mitch Kelley '11, won the discus with a throw of 145-6, a big personal best for the sophomore. He threw an even better mark that he narrowly fouled in stepping out of the circle.</p>
              <p align="left">Although he did not win, Greg Tao '10, provisionally qualified in the pole vault with a jump of 15-5 to claim second in the event.</p>
              <p align="left">Many other personal best and New England Division III qualifying marks were had on the warm but windy day. MIT represented itself well in its first meet of the season. Next week, MIT is back in Massachusetts as they head mid-state to WPI to defend their Engineer's Cup title against RPI and WPI.</p>
