  <p class="style1">Minus Distance Runners, MIT Wins Springfield Invitational</p>
  <p class="style2">Women Set Four NCAA Qualifying Marks, Men One </p>
  <p align="left">April 18, 2009</p>
  <p align="left">MIT traveled to Springfield College on Saturday for the <a href="springfield.res.html">Springfield Invitational</a>. While not quite spring weather. the conditions were the best MIT has seen since the Point Loma meet in California. The temperatures started out around 65 degrees with the sun shining but when the clouds came out the temperatures dropped to 60 with a strong wind. This did not seem to affect anyone as MIT had five NCAA qualifying marks, four for the women and one for the men. </p>
  <p align="left">Traveling sans distance runners, with just the goal of setting individuals up for the championships, MIT nevertheless won both the men's and women's meet. The men defeated 12 other teams by scoring 199.5 points, while the women defeated 11 other teams with 178.5 points. </p>
  <p align="left">The NCAA qualifiers were led by Amy Magnuson '10, who found her rhythm in the 100HH, running a 14.47 despite a poor start, winning by over a second. Also qualifying for nationals was Portia Jones '12, who did not win the 400, but she did finish second with a 56.95. Emily Hwang '09, won the pole vault, nearly clearing 12-7, although she did clear 12-1 1/2, two inches lower than her best this season, which leads all NCAA Division III qualifiers. The womens 4x400 team of Jamie Simmons '12, Andrea Bradshaw '09, Martha Gross '12, and Jones ran yet another school record in 3:56.16 to easily win the event. Simmons smoked the opening leg with a 58.1 to set up the victory. Bradshaw and Gross both delivered 59.4 legs, setting Jones up for a 58.5 anchor. Although the quartet has the second fastest time in the country to this point, they will need to run about two seconds faster if they hope to make the NCAA Championship field. Stephen Morton '10, was the only male setting an NCAA mark for MIT. After finally recovering from a severe cold that put him out for two weeks, Morton leaped to a 23-6 1/4 winning long jump.</p>
  <p align="left">Many victories were earned by the Engineers. On the women's side, Simmons won the 400IH with a 66.13. Jacqui Wentz '10, won the 1500 in an MIT record of 4:39.64. Also, Liz Labuz '09, took first place honors in the 3000 Steeplechase with a personal best of 11:47.85. For the men, Vlad Sobes '11, won his specialty, the javelin throw, with a toss of 176-8. Greg Tao '10, won the pole vault despite the low height of 14-2 3/4. Morton also won the triple jump, but with only being permitted two jumps by the coaches, was only able to jump 46-3 1/2. Yermie Cohen '09, took the 1500 in a time of 4:01.00. Paul Welle '11, earned the victory in the 3000 Steeplechase with a 9:34.73. Jake Ruzevick '09, took the 10K with a casual run in 32:52.51.</p>
  <p align="left">Both of Portia Jones' efforts set MIT records. Jones' 200 time was a 25.32, setting both the freshman and varsity record. Her 400 time also set both the freshman and varsity record. </p>
  <p align="left">Next weekend, MIT travels to Mount Holyoke for the NEWMAC Championship. Wheaton College has won the women's meet every year but one, when MIT took the championship in 2007. The MIT men have won the championship every year with the exception of 2000 when Springfield College earned the victory. MIT has a good chance at winning both championships if the teams perform the way they are capable and compete at the championship level MIT is known for.</p>
