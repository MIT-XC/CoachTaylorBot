England Championship</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>May 12-13, 2000</P>

<P>Eight Track and Field athletes qualified for and made the trip
down to Storrs, Connecticut to compete in the New England
Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association Outdoor Track and Field
Championship. This meet represents one of only two opportunities each
season that athletes from Division III Institutions can compete
against athletes from Division I and II schools.</P>

<P>With MIT heading into exams, only those individuals who qualify
and have a chance to move on to the NCAA Division III Championships
usually go to this meet. The two day meet would have started with
Nikos Michalakis '01, in the Javelin, but Nikos is still nursing a
strained oblique muscle. Robbie Gray '02, got things rolling in the
Long Jump. Robbie had nice distance but could not get on the board,
finishing with a jump of 20-5.</P>

<P>Tony Pelosi '01, entered in the 400IH, ran a 56.06, his second
best time of the season. In the 1500, Sean Montgomery '01, was to run
the trials on Friday and finals on Saturday if he qualified. In the
trials, Sean spent a lot of energy moving in and out of the crowded
pack, causing him to fatigue in the final 200 meters. Sean
nevertheless finished in 3:54.04, good enough to make it into the
finals. Later in the evening of the first day, Chris McGuire '00, was
going for a national qualifying effort in the 5000 to go along with
his qualifying performance in the 10K back in March. Unfortunately,
the pace was ridiculously slow. The mile split was 4:49 and the 1 1/2
was 7:19. At this point Chris took the lead and pushed the pace to 69
second quarters. However, Chris could not hear his splits and did not
know if the pace was fast or not. Not expecting to be in position to
win the race, Chris was too timid and let the opportunity slip away.
However, he still finished strong to make the provisional standard
with a time of 14:49.25, good enough for 3rd place.</P>

<P>On Saturday, Craig Mielcarz '03, started things of in the High
Jump. The opening height was 6-5, which Craig did not make. Craig
usually gets better as the competition progresses, and starting so
high never allowed him to get into the rhythm.</P>

<P>The 1500 was a final of 10 runners, of which Sean was the only one
from Division III. Unlike the 5000, there was no fooling around with
the pace in this one. The first quarter was in 58 for Sean and he was
towards the back. At the half, Sean had moved up nicely, coming
through with a split of 2:00 for the 800. The third quarter was more
of the same, coming in at 3:02 with Sean in good position for 3rd
place. With 200 to go, Sean seemed to let the pain get the best of
him and lost 3 places. However, with 100 to go he woke up and passed
them back to finish in 4th with a PR of 3:50.25.</P>

<P>The 1600 Relay was going for a national qualifying mark of 3:17.
Even if that time were achieved, the team of Yuval Mazor '02, Todd
Rosenfield '01, Matt Lehman '03, and Montgomery knew they would have
to run a solid 3:16 in order to make nationals. Yuval led things off
with his best time of the year, a 49.2 leadoff. Todd, who actually
runs faster indoors than outdoors, had a fine leg of 50.1. Lehman
made up some ground with his 49.5 leg, and Sean, running a 49.2, kept
MIT in solid position while almost catching the 2nd place team in the
second fastest section. The 3:18.00 was the best time for MIT this
year, but not good enough to advance to any other championships. </P>

<P>Montgomery, McGuire, and Michalakis have qualified for nationals
and will be traveling to Naperville on May 23. Mielcarz is qualified
provisionally in the High Jump and may try to better his position
this weekend at RPI, the hosts of a last chance qualifying meet.</P>
