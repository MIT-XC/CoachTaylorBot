    WITH VICTORY OVER RPI AND WPI IN ENGINEER'S CUP**
    
    
    
    April 1, 2000
    
    
    
    
    
    After a successful Spring Trip to California, hopes for a good
    start to the season were high. RPI and WPI came to Cambridge to test
    MIT in this usually foul weather meet. The weather was a surprise
    with 60 degree temperatures, and sunny, clear skies, but the results
    were as expected. MIT scored at least 10 points in every event except
    the three rotational throws (hammer, discus, shot put) as they won
    with a score of 197 to 143 to RPI, and 48 for WPI.
    
    
    
    
    
    The new NCAA scoring format for tri-meets is 7-5-4-3-2-1 for
    individual events and 7-5-0 for relays. The three teams agreed that
    up to four individuals from a team could score in an event, for a
    possibility of 19 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    RPI showed up with a significant loss in that their national
    qualifying pole vaulter/decathlete was out with an injury. In
    addition, a couple of them missed the bus, which certainly did not
    help their chances in what had appeared to be a close meet on
    paper.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT began with their strength as they opened the Long Jump and
    High Jump with 34 out of a possible 38 points as Junius Ho '01, and
    Craig Mielcarz led the way with 21-6 1/2 and 6-6 marks respectively.
    Although the Engineers from Cambridge were getting nearly shutout in
    the Hammer and Discus, MIT made up for it with 31 points in the Pole
    Vault and Triple Jump. The Shot Put was as disappointing for MIT as
    the hammer and discus had been, but Nikos Michalakis '01, and his
    brother Spiros '03, kept the throws from being a total wash with a
    201-1 victory, and a 152-0 4th place .
    
    
    
    
    
    The running events went in MIT's favor as they outscored their NY
    rivals 116-64, excluding the relays. It is doubtful that MIT has ever
    been disqualified in both relays, until this meet that is. In the 400
    Relay, Robbie Gray '02, strained his hamstring, preventing him from
    making the exchange within the zone, thus disqualifying the team. In
    the longer relay, a last minute substitute, and a corresponding
    coaching blunder, led to 1 of 4 relay members not wearing the
    identical uniform. So, instead of the 12 points for 2nd in the 400
    Relay and 1st in the 1600 Relay, Tech came away with 0.
    
    
    
    
    
    Highlights in the running events were a PR (and 2nd victory of the
    day) in the High Hurdles by Junius Ho with a 15.97 time into the
    wind, a 50.39 by Yuval Mazor '02, in the 400, Tony Pelosi '01,
    running a huge PR of 56.71, Sean Montgomery '01, running to his
    second victory with a 1:56.54 800, and Albert Liu '03, running
    15:54.9 in the 5000.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the Engineers travel to Waterville, ME to face host
    Colby, Bowdoin, and Southern Maine.

    **MIT ATHLETES REVERSE SEEDS AT
    NATIONALS**
    
    
    
    **McGuire Places 5th in
    10,000**
    
    
    
    
    
    May 25-27, 2000
    
    
    
    
    
    The MIT Men's Track and Field team qualified three individuals for
    the 2000 Outdoor Championships held at North Central College in
    Naperville, IL. Two were seeded to score and earn All-American
    honors, and one was not. Chris McGuire '00, the one not seeded to
    score, closed his MIT career in style, placing 5th in the 10,000
    meter race with a huge personal best of 30:41.98, earning
    All-American honors. Nikos Michalakis '01, and Sean Montgomery '01,
    failed to make the finals in their events.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sean was the first to participate for MIT as the 1500 trials were
    scheduled for the first day. Sean was in the 2nd of two heats, which
    would qualify the top 4 from each plus the next 4 fastest times. The
    first heat was quite slow with the times ranging from 3:55-4:01.
    Seeded third overall, Sean was willing to sit in the back of the pack
    and sprint home on the final lap. However, the pace was incredibly
    slow at 66 for the first 400 and 2:12 at the half. The pack moved
    during the 3rd quarter as they ran a 61 split. Sean moved to 4th and
    then dropped back to 7th, unable to keep up. Sean finished with a sub
    par 3:58.17. After the race both he and his coach came to the
    conclusion that the slow pace had Sean running flat, taking the
    strength out of his legs. "He was definitely ready to win it", said
    Coach Halston Taylor. "He ran 3:50 and 1:52 in the past two weeks and
    had prepared and rested properly since then".
    
    
    
    
    
    Later in the evening, with the sun and heat not so intense, Chris
    took to the track. Seeded 15th, Chris's goal was to place in the top
    6, a lofty goal. The pace for the first three miles was quite
    consistent (4:58, 4:55, 4:57) with no one wanting to take a chance
    too early. The fourth mile was significantly faster as Colin Young,
    the eventual winner, picked up the pace, thus stringing out the
    field. Chris made the move to stay with the 3rd group, consisting of
    places 5th-8th. His fourth mile was in 4:49, and he was moving up to
    the 3rd and 4th place runners. The fifth and sixth miles were back
    around 4:58 pace as the runners were showing signs of fatigue. Chris
    had moved into a solid group of 4, who were vying for 3rd place. With
    3 laps to go, 1 runner dropped from the pack, and with 1 lap to go,
    the group took off. Chris finished with a 64 final 400 and still got
    beat by the other two runners, finishing 5th in 30:41.98, a 15 second
    personal best. His time was good for 3rd on the all time MIT
    list.
    
    
    
    
    
    On Saturday, Nikos was up in the Javelin trials. Nikos had flown
    in the night before as he had some personal matters to attend to.
    This did not allow for him to get accustomed to the throwing surface
    or wet conditions. Looking good in his warmups, the feeling was that
    he would at least match his 5th place finish from 1999. However, on
    his first attempt, Nikos slipped on the wet surface and fouled what
    would have been a 200+ throw. On his second attempt, he got a fair
    throw in, but it was nothing more than that as he again slipped. On
    his final effort in the trials, he had a pretty good throw, but was
    not able to "block" very well for fear of slipping again. His best
    effort of 184-4 did not make finals.
    
    
    
    
    
    As more and more of the NAIA and Division II colleges migrate
    towards Division III, the standards for making nationals continue to
    become more difficult. The NCAA has not raised the number of
    qualifiers from approximately 16 per event, which is the reason that
    Sean Montgomery did not make the 800 field, despite his 1:52.20
    performance.

    **MEN'S TRACK FINISHES 4TH IN NEW ENGLAND
    DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
    
    **Injury And Illness Combine To Put MIT Out Of
    Running**
    
    
    
    
    
    May **** 6, 2000
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT went into the New England Division III Championship this
    weekend seeded 4th and that is exactly where they finished with 70
    points, behind host Springfield's 123, Williams' 96, and Bates' 83.
    It was the first time in four NE Div. III Championships that MIT
    finished so low in the team scoring. After the Indoor victory, it was
    assumed by many that MIT would continue it's streak given the youth
    of their team, but misfortune paid a visit to the Engineer's, forcing
    them to wait until next year to win another title.
    
    
    
    
    
    When provisional national qualifier, Dan Feldman '02, decided to
    forego the outdoor season in favor of the Boston Marathon, the team
    thought they could rally and get the job done. When Rick Rajter '03,
    the leading point scorer from the indoor season, came down with a
    season ending stress fracture due to a structural imbalance in his
    foot the team still thought if things went well they would have a
    chance. But in the final week, when Peter Bluvas '01, last year's
    decathlon runner-up, held a 104 degree fever for three days, and
    Kalpak Kothari '01, last year's Triple Jump champion, developed a
    heel bruise when landing incorrectly on his 2nd phase during last
    week's conference championship, the team realized it was not in their
    immediate future to win the title.
    
    
    
    
    
    Nevertheless, the team went to Springfield to get the job done.
    Chris McGuire '00, started things off in the 10K with an easy victory
    in the balmy 80+ degree, humid weather. Chris, having already
    qualified for the National Championship later this month, and
    planning on running a fast 5K next weekend, just ran to win, doing so
    by 27 seconds in 32:04.67.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the Long Jump, Tech was seeded for 2 points. Junius Ho '01, set
    a PR with a leap of 21-7 1/4 to steal 6th place and Robbie Gray '02,
    came through with a 20-10 1/2 effort for 8th place and a total of 4
    points. At the same time, the Javelin was going on, but Nikos
    Michalakis '01, was not having a good time of it. Nikos came into the
    meet with a sore shoulder and elbow, and during warm-up, strained his
    obliques. Nevertheless, he took two throws before pulling out, good
    enough to secure 3rd with a 193-4 throw, one place lower than his
    seed.
    
    
    
    
    
    One of the best events for MIT was the 400 Relay. Tech was seeded
    12th with a 43.96 and set to run in the slow section. MIT was
    convinced they had worked out the problems with their new line-up and
    were ready to run well enough to not only win their section, but also
    place. Robbie Gray came over from the Long Jump and provided a fine
    lead off leg, but just missed the first attempt at handing off to
    Kevin Atkinson '02. They connected a split second later, apparently
    not losing any speed through the zone. Kevin's handoff to Yuval Mazor
    '02, was perfect, allowing Yuval to move up to 2nd, behind Tufts
    coming into the final handoff. Yuval called for the pass a bit too
    soon, causing Marc Washington to run with his hand back too long.
    However, once Marc received the baton, he walked down the Tufts'
    anchor, finishing in 42.95 to not only win their section, but also
    place 6th, only .01 out of 5th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    Craig Mielcarz '03,  did not live up to his 7th seed in the Long
    Jump, but he more than made up for that by coming through in the High
    Jump. Craig was not looking good during warm-ups, and did not jump
    well at his opening height of 6-3, but as the competition went on,
    Craig improved. Only two jumpers cleared 6-7, and Craig did so in
    less attempts. At 6-9 1/2, Craig had two good attempts, but did not
    make it. In addition to the victory, Brian Hoying '03, added a
    6th.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 1500, another event we were expected to win, was not going to
    be as easy as the 10K. Sean Montgomery '01, was undefeated all
    season, nevertheless his victory was not guaranteed. The pace started
    out slow with 64 first quarter. Gradually the pace picked up with a
    2:07 800, with Sean sitting in 2nd place. The third quarter picked up
    significantly as Matt Twiest from Bates, leading from the beginning
    tried to break up the field. Coming through in 3:08, freshman Mark
    Miller from Keene State, took over and picked up the pace. Sean was
    still following until there was 200 to go. At that point Sean tried
    to take the lead but was held off by Miller until the final straight.
    Finally, with 100 to go, Sean pulled into the lead, winning with a
    3:52.04 performance.
    
    
    
    
    
    Junius was up again, this time in the 110HH Final. Junius had a
    poor start in the trials but finished strong in 15.77. In the finals,
    he came out well, but was not sprinting well between the hurdles.
    Nevertheless, Junius finished in 7th, 2 places up from his 9th
    seed.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the 400IH, Tony Pelosi '01, was ready to improve on his 55.94
    PR in the trials earlier in the afternoon. Tony somehow got out a
    little off, and for the first time this season came to the first
    hurdle with 23 steps instead of his usual 22. Tony can hurdle well
    with both legs, but the change through him off enough that he tried
    to get back on the correct leg, causing him to struggle and fatigue
    too early. Tony faded in the final 100, running 57.54 for 8th.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT was favored to score 4 points in the Pole Vault, an event the
    Engineers had three entrants in. Matt Potts '00, and Dan Opila '03,
    both cleared the first two heights to put themselves in good scoring
    position. Matt, struggling all year, came through when it counted
    most with a 13-3 1/2 personal best for 4th place. Dan finished in 6th
    place to give Tech 8 points in the event.
    
    
    
    
    
    Ed Keehr, was seeded 6th in the 5000, but when the early pace went
    out quickly in the high temperatures, Ed began to fade. Normally very
    consistent, Ed started running 78 second pace after the first mile
    and a half, and by 2 miles was up to 80 pace, and about to lose
    possession of 8th place. Somehow, Ed found a way to get it back. With
    2 1/2 laps to go, Ed started coming back. He ran a 78 quarter to
    start to move up on the 6th and 7th place runners. Ed's next lap was
    a 69 as he blew past the runners and into 5th place. Another runner
    caught Ed despite his continued kick, leaving Ed with his predicted
    6th place in 15:35.68.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final event, the 1600 Relay, looked to be hotly contested with
    many possible sub 3:20 performances. Instead, the heat during the day
    wore everyone out, resulting in no teams breaking 3:20. MIT started
    off with Mazor who brought the baton home in 50.0 and just behind
    Colby College. Todd Rosenfield '01, went out hard, taking over the
    lead and pulling away until the 200 mark. Amherst College and Colby
    were coming up strong in the end with Amherst pulling slightly ahead
    at the handoff. The handoff from Rosenfield, who ran a 50.4 leg, to
    Matt Lehman '03, was not very good, which put Lehman behind Amherst.
    Matt worked too hard to pull into the lead, causing him to fatigue
    too much at the end, which allowed Amherst to finish even up, with
    Springfield and Colby close behind. Montgomery had a great handoff to
    take a quick lead. Down the back straight, the Amherst runner put
    some pressure on Sean who responded by pulling away and never looking
    back, finishing in 49.6 to bring the team to victory in 3:20.28.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the Engineer's travel to UConn for the All Division New
    England Championships.

    **Montgomery and McGuire Place at All New
    England Championship**
    
    
    
    May 12-13, 2000
    
    
    
    
    
    Eight Track and Field athletes qualified for and made the trip
    down to Storrs, Connecticut to compete in the New England
    Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association Outdoor Track and Field
    Championship. This meet represents one of only two opportunities each
    season that athletes from Division III Institutions can compete
    against athletes from Division I and II schools.
    
    
    
    
    
    With MIT heading into exams, only those individuals who qualify
    and have a chance to move on to the NCAA Division III Championships
    usually go to this meet. The two day meet would have started with
    Nikos Michalakis '01, in the Javelin, but Nikos is still nursing a
    strained oblique muscle. Robbie Gray '02, got things rolling in the
    Long Jump. Robbie had nice distance but could not get on the board,
    finishing with a jump of 20-5.
    
    
    
    
    
    Tony Pelosi '01, entered in the 400IH, ran a 56.06, his second
    best time of the season. In the 1500, Sean Montgomery '01, was to run
    the trials on Friday and finals on Saturday if he qualified. In the
    trials, Sean spent a lot of energy moving in and out of the crowded
    pack, causing him to fatigue in the final 200 meters. Sean
    nevertheless finished in 3:54.04, good enough to make it into the
    finals. Later in the evening of the first day, Chris McGuire '00, was
    going for a national qualifying effort in the 5000 to go along with
    his qualifying performance in the 10K back in March. Unfortunately,
    the pace was ridiculously slow. The mile split was 4:49 and the 1 1/2
    was 7:19. At this point Chris took the lead and pushed the pace to 69
    second quarters. However, Chris could not hear his splits and did not
    know if the pace was fast or not. Not expecting to be in position to
    win the race, Chris was too timid and let the opportunity slip away.
    However, he still finished strong to make the provisional standard
    with a time of 14:49.25, good enough for 3rd place.
    
    
    
    
    
    On Saturday, Craig Mielcarz '03, started things of in the High
    Jump. The opening height was 6-5, which Craig did not make. Craig
    usually gets better as the competition progresses, and starting so
    high never allowed him to get into the rhythm.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 1500 was a final of 10 runners, of which Sean was the only one
    from Division III. Unlike the 5000, there was no fooling around with
    the pace in this one. The first quarter was in 58 for Sean and he was
    towards the back. At the half, Sean had moved up nicely, coming
    through with a split of 2:00 for the 800. The third quarter was more
    of the same, coming in at 3:02 with Sean in good position for 3rd
    place. With 200 to go, Sean seemed to let the pain get the best of
    him and lost 3 places. However, with 100 to go he woke up and passed
    them back to finish in 4th with a PR of 3:50.25.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 1600 Relay was going for a national qualifying mark of 3:17.
    Even if that time were achieved, the team of Yuval Mazor '02, Todd
    Rosenfield '01, Matt Lehman '03, and Montgomery knew they would have
    to run a solid 3:16 in order to make nationals. Yuval led things off
    with his best time of the year, a 49.2 leadoff. Todd, who actually
    runs faster indoors than outdoors, had a fine leg of 50.1. Lehman
    made up some ground with his 49.5 leg, and Sean, running a 49.2, kept
    MIT in solid position while almost catching the 2nd place team in the
    second fastest section. The 3:18.00 was the best time for MIT this
    year, but not good enough to advance to any other championships. 
    
    
    
    
    
    Montgomery, McGuire, and Michalakis have qualified for nationals
    and will be traveling to Naperville on May 23. Mielcarz is qualified
    provisionally in the High Jump and may try to better his position
    this weekend at RPI, the hosts of a last chance qualifying meet.

    **MIT LOSES TO POWERFUL SPRINGFIELD IN
    NEWMAC CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
    
    April 29, 2000
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT Men's Track and Field team went into the 2nd annual NEWMAC
    Championship as defending champions, and according to the seeds,
    slight (5 point) favorites. However, Springfield College, fierce
    competitors at home, proved that they can step up when necessary as
    they defeated MIT by a score of 212.5 to 198.5. Coast Guard with 115,
    WPI at 42, and Wheaton scoring 39 were the remaining teams.
    
    
    
    
    
    Springfield's team has a base of throwers and sprinters, exactly
    MIT's weaknesses. Conversely, MIT's strength within the conference is
    in the 1500 and up, where Springfield is considerably weak. True to
    form Springfield scored 78 out of a possible 112 points in the four
    throwing events to MIT's 12. In the 1500, 3000 Steeplechase, 5000,
    and 10K MIT scored 80 out of a possible 112 to Springfield's 9. The
    difference came in the sprints where Springfield dominated to the
    point of 37.5 to 8.5 in the 100 and 200.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT fell behind in some early events where they were expected to
    do better, but came through very well later in the meet. Both teams
    experienced many personal bests throughout the meet, but Springfield
    appeared more ready for the challenge.
    
    
    
    
    
    The first event was the 10K. MIT took advantage of their distance
    strength and entered the maximum of 4 runners according to conference
    rules. No other team had any entries, thus giving the maximum of 28
    points to MIT. Hoping to save strength for next week, yet wanting to
    run fast enough to qualify for the New England Division III
    Championships next weekend, Liyan Guo '01, Ed Keehr '01, and Albert
    Liu '03, went out at a pace that would bring them in under 35:00.
    Keehr and Liu were returning later in the meet in the 5000 if
    necessary, and did not go with Guo after the scheduled 3 mile mark
    increase in pace. Guo won easily in 34:17.82.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Long Jump, Hammer, and Javelin all began at 11:00AM for the
    men. In the Hammer, Greg Walker '03, came through with a nice PR of
    123-8 to snare 6th place on his last throw. The Long Jump was
    supposed to net MIT 9 more points than Springfield, but instead
    Springfield outscored MIT by 8. This 17 point swing would prove to
    haunt Tech as the meet wore on. The Javelin went as expected for MIT
    in that Nikos Michalakis '01, won, but there were some easy points to
    pick up which Springfield did and MIT did not, netting Springfield 5
    more points than they were seeded to score.
    
    
    
    
    
    After these early events, the Engineers settled down and began to
    produce fine performances. In the 3000 Steeplechase, Phil Loiselle
    '01, Craig Wildman '03, and Sean Nolan '03 came through with 2nd,
    4th, and 6th places respectively. Loiselle ran to a season best of
    10:00.20, and Wildman cut his best by over 20 seconds with a 10:05.00
    4th place performance.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT's lack of sprinters was evident in the 400 Relay. Still making
    adjustments with their new lineup, MIT's first two handoffs left a
    bit to be desired as Springfield and Coast Guard ran away with the
    first two places. The 100 trials did not go well either. Marc
    Washington '03, and Robbie Gray '02, ran personal bests of 11.40 and
    11.44 respectively, but Springfield held the first three qualifying
    positions. In the final, MIT surprised by placing 4th and 5th, taking
    the 3rd place away from Springfield.
    
    
    
    
    
    Fortunately, the 1500 was next. Sean Montgomery '01, and Chris
    McGuire '00, were surprised by a very fast early pace of 62 at the
    400 and 2:05 at the 800. The pace did not slow at the 1200 in 3:08,
    but Montgomery picked it up anyway, finishing his last 300 in 46 to
    run a national qualifying performance, and meet record of 3:54.66 on
    this windy afternoon. McGuire ran to a 4 second PR of 3:56.58 for 3rd
    place. This is certainly bad news for McGuire's 10K opponents at
    Nationals.
    
    
    
    
    
    Another event which did not go well for Tech was the 110HH. MIT
    was supposed to score a 3rd and 5th in the race, but instead received
    4th and 6th. Unfortunately, Springfield stepped up and won the event
    when their runner was seeded 2nd.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT hoped for breakthrough performances in the 400 and High Jump,
    but that turned out not to be the case. Yuval Mazor '02, led the way
    for MIT in the 400 with a 50.31 personal best of 4th, but Sabol from
    Springfield won the event. Likewise, freshmen Craig Mielcarz and
    Brian Hoying hoped to improve their great marks of 6-8 and 6-6
    respectively, but it was not their day as they both cleared a very
    respectable 6-6 while the Springfield jumper made 6-8.
    
    
    
    
    
    Events that went well for MIT came toward the middle part of the
    meet. The Pole Vault went very well as Dan Kwon '02, jumped 13-0 1/4
    to tie for 2nd with the Springfield jumper. Matt Potts '00, and Dan
    Opila '03 contributed for 4th and 5th respectively. The Triple Jump
    proved another source of good fortune when the Springfield jumper
    seeded 4th fouled out. MIT jumpers took advantage with 3 season
    bests. Kalpak Kothari '01 leaped 44-08 1/4 for 2nd, Junius Ho '01,
    41-09 1/4 for 4th, and Robbie Gray with a 6th place 40-07 effort.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 800 and 400IH looked like they might be pivotal events for MIT
    when Sean Montgomery (1:53.88), John Biesiadecki '01 (1:58.05), and
    George Hanson '03 (2:00.99), upset Springfield for a 1st, 3rd, and
    6th in the 800 to score a 4 point swing on Springfield. The
    intermediates provided similar results as Tony Pelosi '01, Peter
    Bluvas '01, and Mielcarz placed 3rd, 4th, and 5th to get 1 more point
    than they were seeded.
    
    
    
    
    
    With only the 5000 and 1600 Relay to go, MIT was down by 33
    points. Coach Taylor made the decision to go ahead and double back
    the 10K runners as well as Sean Nolan '03, from the Steeplechase, and
    McGuire from the 1500. The hope was that if MIT could sweep there was
    still a slim chance that Springfield might get disqualified in the
    relay enabling MIT to win the meet. As it turned out, Keehr and
    McGuire were able to place 1st and 2nd pretty easily, but Springfield
    had a runner who ran a big season best to claim 3rd, thus clinching
    the victory for the home team.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the finale, the foursome of Mazor, Todd Rosenfield '01, Matt
    Lehman '03, and Montgomery ran a comfortable 3:19.93 to win going
    away.
    
    
    
    
    
    Coach Taylor took the blame for his team's loss. "Whenever our
    track team does not respond to a championship challenge like this one
    it is the head coach's fault for not properly preparing and
    motivating the team."
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the Engineers travel back to Springfield for the New
    England Division III Championships. Those contending for the title
    are Springfield, MIT, and Williams College.

    **MEN'S TRACK AND FIELD MOVES TO
    5-0**
    
    
    
    April 8, 2000
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT Men's Track and Field team traveled to Brunswick, Maine today
    with their 2-0 record to take on Bowdoin (runners-up in the New
    England Indoor Division III Championship), Colby, and the University
    of Southern Maine. They left with a 5-0 record in a fairly close meet
    with Bowdoin, outscoring the Bears 249 1/2 to 229 1/2. Colby and
    Southern Maine finished with 138 and 52 points respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    The weather, which was supposed to include rain and colder
    temperatures, cooperated with sunshine and 60s. This allowed for some
    better performances, but overall, it looked like the Engineers were
    not very psyched up for the competition.
    
    
    
    
    
    Once again, MIT was led by the jumpers as they scored 67 1/2
    points out of a possible 81 in the Long, Triple, and High Jumps. The
    new NCAA scoring format for quadrangular meets awards 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1
    points for 1-8 places, allowing up to 4 individuals to score from a
    team per event. Craig Mielcarz, 03, led the way with 24 points as he
    won the High Jump (6-6), placed 3rd in the Long Jump with 20-0, and
    also scored in the two hurdle events with a 6th in the 110HH and a
    3rd in the 400IH. Also doing well in the jumps was Junius Ho '01, who
    scored a 2nd in the Triple Jump with a 40-0 performance, a 4th in the
    Long Jump, and also won the 110HH in a best of 15.73. Kalpak Kothari
    '01, won the Triple Jump with a 42' effort on the uphill approach
    with the additional challenge of the landing area being higher than
    the takeoff board due to the sand being higher than the borders of
    the pit.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the middle distance events, Sean Montgomery '01, showed his
    All-America form despite suffering through a stomach problem the last
    half of the week. Sean took the lead in the 1500 with 700 to go,
    running the final 600 meters in 1:33 to win easily in 3:58.42. Sean
    came back in the 800, taking the lead with 400 to go, running 55
    seconds on the final lap to finish 20 meters in front in 1:54.86.
    Also performing well in the middle distances were Chris McGuire '00,
    with a 4:01.84 2nd place PR in the 1500, and a 5th and 6th place
    finish from George Hanson '03, and Matt Yarosz '00, running 2:01.97
    and 2:02.28 respectively in the 800.
    
    
    
    
    
    There were a few other key performances in the meet. Perhaps the
    most outstanding of those performances was Ed Keehr's '01, 15:08.72
    victory in the 5000. Ed's time was a 31 second PR. Kevin Atkinson's
    '02,  8th place finish in the 100 was nearly a .4 personal best, and
    his start was not particularly impressive. Freshman Greg Walker threw
    two personal bests, with 113' efforts in both the Hammer and Discus.
    Peter Bluvas '01, improved 6 feet in the Discus with a 121'01"
    effort. Of course, in the Javelin, Nikos Michalakis '01, won his
    event with a throw of 197-2.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the Engineers travel to Medford to face the Jumbos of
    Tufts and UMass Lowell in what promises to be a very challenging
    meet.

    **MIT CRUISES TO UNDEFEATED
    SEASON**
    
    
    
    April 15, 2000
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT took their 5-0 record to the home of the Tufts Jumbos with the
    hope of returning to Cambridge 8-0. Division II, UMass/Lowell,
    Bowdoin, and Tufts, all have considerable talent, but it proved to be
    insufficient to stop the Engineers from their quest as MIT claimed
    first with 226 points to 180 for UMass/Lowell, 140 for Tufts, and 113
    for Bowdoin.
    
    
    
    
    
    On Friday, when the seeds were released to the coaches, it was
    apparent that Bowdoin, who had a good chance of winning the meet if
    they decided to make the effort, would be satisfied with preparing
    athletes for later in the season by taking it easy on them in this
    meet. Tufts, still hurting from injuries incurred during the indoor
    season, would show good representation, but did not have enough,
    particularly in the jumping events, to present a serious challenge.
    UMass/Lowell not only had the personnel to gain the victory, they had
    their athletes positioned to get the job done. Lowell held the upper
    hand in the sprints through the 400, including the relays, and the
    throws. MIT had higher seeds in the 1500-5000, and the Triple Jump
    and Pole Vault. The 400IH, 800, Javelin, Long Jump, and High Jump
    were pretty even. MIT Coach Halston Taylor thought it would be these
    events that would decide the meet.
    
    
    
    
    
    The first event, the Long Jump, proved to be an indicator of how
    things were to proceed for the remainder of the day. Jumping with the
    wind, the Lowell jumpers took the initial lead with first and second.
    Junius Ho '01, was the first Engineer to split them up, and Craig
    Mielcarz '03, joined him after his second attempt. Going into the
    finals, Craig had taken the lead, with Junius still in 3rd. In the
    second round of the finals, Mason of Lowell passed Mielcarz by 1
    centimeter for the lead. Craig came back and retook the lead by 2
    centimeters. In the next and final round, Mason seemed to put it away
    with a fine 22-2 effort, 15 centimeters ahead of Mielcarz. Craig was
    not to be denied. With plenty of support from his teammates, he hit
    the board well, sailing to 6.77/22-2 1/2 for the victory.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the throws, some of the Bowdoin throwers did not show up, and
    it seemed that only the MIT throwers took advantage, scoring far more
    points than anticipated and more than they had all year. Peter Bluvas
    '01, competing with a pulled groin, was able to throw a personal best
    of 121-1 to place 3rd, and freshman Greg Walker, placed 4th with a
    personal best of his own at 118-7.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Pole Vault, only had entries from Bowdoin and MIT. Last week,
    Bowdoin had handed MIT a pretty thorough defeat in the vault, and
    Tech hoped to reverse that, particularly with one of Bowdoin's better
    vaulters out with an injury. Plagued by the cross winds and
    inconsistent run ups, MIT once again fell 2nd to Bowdoin, but
    nevertheless gained 17 points on Lowell.
    
    
    
    
    
    Coming out of the first three events, MIT had doubled Lowell's
    score 50 to 25. Two key matchups were getting underway in the Javelin
    and High Jump. Nikos Michalakis '01, was taking his 201' Javelin mark
    against a Lowell thrower whose best is 194'. On the other side of the
    track Mielcarz and Brian Hoying '03, were taking their 6-8 and 6-6
    jumping bests against Lowell's 6-8 and 6-4 tandem. In both cases, MIT
    came out on top. Nikos popped a 204-11 on his first throw to end the
    suspense and secure the victory. He was accompanied by a 162-3 effort
    for 4th by his brother Spiros, and a 155-6 personal best by Dakus
    Gunn '01, for 5th. Mielcarz continued his freshman year undefeated
    string with a 6-5 1/2 victory, and Hoying supported him for 2nd
    place, narrowly missing 6-7 1/2 on three very good attempts.
    
    
    
    
    
    By this time, the 400 Relay was about to get underway to start off
    the track events. MIT, favored to place 3rd, had made a change in
    their lineup with the sudden improvement of Kevin Atkinson '02, and
    the apparent fatigue of Todd Rosenfield '01. The change, while
    looking okay in practice, exposed premature handoffs on the first two
    exchanges to slow MIT down considerably for a 44.30 finish.
    Fortunately, Bowdoin, the favorites, dropped the baton on the first
    exchange, allowing MIT to score 5 points with their 3rd place
    finish.
    
    
    
    
    
    Continuing to receive gifts from Bowdoin, the Steeplechase was a
    dual between 2 runners from Tufts and 3 from MIT. Bowdoin pulled
    their runners in favor of the 1500, and Lowell did not have any
    runners capable of the steeple event. Running season bests, Phil
    Loiselle '01, and Craig Wildman '03, finished 2nd and 5th with
    10:05.87 and 10:29.05 respectively. Sean Nolan '03, continued to
    struggle since his debut in California three weeks ago, running
    10:16.62 for 4th place. Once again, MIT added 16 points to Lowell's
    0.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 1500, the premier event along with the 800, had the best
    runners from all four schools ready to test the windy conditions. MIT
    only entered two runners, Sean Montgomery '01, and Chris McGuire '00,
    because the field was so deep and talented, it looked like it would
    take a 4:08 or better to place in the top eight. Sean sat in the rear
    and stayed out of trouble, letting the race develop until the halfway
    point. After the leaders came through the 800 in 2:13, Sean moved up,
    causing the pack to run the 3rd 400 in 61. Sean took the lead and
    picked it up a little as the final 400 was covered in 60, leaving
    everyone in his dust except for his teammate. Sean and Chris finished
    1-2 with 3:59.76 and 4:00.91 respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    At this point, MIT had a 60 point lead, and things looked well in
    hand. However, Lowell had the potential to make up that difference in
    the 100-800 events if things went their way. In the Shot Put and 400,
    Lowell made up 36 of those points, putting MIT on alert. Fortunately,
    the High Hurdles did not go as they expected. Running 1-3 halfway
    through the race, both Lowell runners hit hurdles, struggling to the
    line in 7th and 8th place while MIT garnered 15 points. Junius Ho led
    the effort with a 15.90 performance into the wind for 2nd place.
    Bluvas and Mielcarz helped the MIT effort with 4th and 6th place
    finishes respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Triple Jump presented an opportunity to put Lowell away. Even
    without the injured Rick Rajter '03, Tech had the potential to finish
    1-2-3 for 22 points to Lowell's expected 2-3 points. However, a
    foul-out by Ho, combined with an unusually bad day by Robbie Gray
    '02, left MIT with only 13 points to Lowell's 3. Kalpak Kothari
    remained undefeated in the outdoor season with a 42-11 victory.
    
    
    
    
    
    After the 100, Lowell had closed to 41 points behind MIT with
    three of their biggest events to come. The first was the 800. With
    both Lowell and MIT sporting 1:53 half-milers, and many others listed
    between 1:56-1:58, the race was built up as a good one. The leaders
    went out in a conservative 56 first quarter into the strong winds.
    Montgomery let the others do the work, staying patient in 3rd-5th
    place on the inside. With 200 to go, Montgomery and the Lowell runner
    pulled away from the rest of the field, picking up the pace as they
    went. As the two entered the final straight, Montgomery pulled away
    with ease, running 1:52.89 for the victory. John Biesiadecki '01,
    finished with a season best of 1:59.67 for 7th place. Even with the
    victory Lowell took the event 17-11 to close to 35 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the 400IH, Tony Pelosi '01, was to lead the way for Tech. Also
    in the race were fellow 56 second long hurdlers from Tufts and
    Lowell. Tony got out too slowly, forcing him into a catch-up mode.
    Making up significant ground, and nearly in the position to win, he
    went with 17 steps to the 8th hurdle instead of 16 to slow him down
    enough to prevent the victory. Tony did put on a good kick after the
    last hurdle to finish 2nd, ahead of the Lowell runner in a PR of
    56.32. Once again, Bluvas and Mielcarz offered support with 6th and
    7th place finishes to give MIT a 12-6 edge over Lowell, and virtually
    seal the team victory.
    
    
    
    
    
    To wrap things up, Yuval Mazor '02, bounced back from a dismal 400
    with a 23.18 PR in the 200 for 3rd place. McGuire and Ed Keehr '01,
    finished 1-2 in the 5000 with strong support from Albert Liu '03, and
    Liyan Guo '01. The final event, the 1600 Relay summed up the whole
    meet as the foursome of Rosenfield, Matt Lehman '03, Mazor, and
    Montgomery defeated the Indoor All New England Champions from Lowell
    with a 3:21.32 performance. Lehman and Montgomery led the way with
    49.6 and 49.3 splits respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT will back off a bit on the team intensity, and
    pursue some top performances in the Vern Cox Invitational at
    Springfield on Friday night.

    **2000 SPRING TRIP**
    
    
    
    **3 QUALIFY FOR NATIONALS**
    
    
    
    
    
    March 27, 2000
    
    
    
    
    
    As usual, the Spring Trip was built around; building camaraderie,
    rewarding those individuals who most contributed to the success of
    the team in Indoor Track who were also participating in Outdoor Track
    and Field, and a warm weather location for great training and
    competition.
    
    
    
    
    
    Success was found on all fronts. The first four days, our
    contingent of seventeen athletes and three coaches stayed in
    Claremont, CA. The coaching staff at Claremont Mudd Scripps was kind
    and hospitable enough to allow us to use their track and weight room
    facilities at our convenience.
    
    
    
    
    
    We arrived on Monday evening too late for much more than a warmup.
    On Tuesday, after pracitce, we made a trip down to Huntington Beach
    to join our host Neal Karchem '99, for a great day of volleyball,
    frisbee, football, body surfing, and a super barbeque on the beach.
    The entire team really apprectiated Neal's generosity and
    hospitality.
    
    
    
    
    
    After Thursday's practice, the team took a trip to Santa Barbara
    to spend a day on the beach, and eat dinner at Junius Ho's parent's
    Chinese restaurant. In addition to the truly awesome food, the Hos
    made the entire team feel like family. They also invited Payton
    Jordan, the 1968 Olympic Coach for Track and Field, and long time
    Stanford University coach, along with his wife, and Mrs. Duffy
    Daugherty, the wife of the famous ex-football coach of Michigan
    State, both now local friends of the family. Great track and field
    stories went well with the fabulous dinner.
    
    
    
    
    
    On Friday, after practice, we headed down to San Diego. On
    Saturday, the team went their separate ways after a light practice.
    One group went to Tijuana while another group went to watch a local
    track meet at Point Loma. Both groups met up at UCSD to observe the
    elite Discus competition. UCSD has perhaps the greatest discus
    throwing area in the world. Headwinds blow off the ocean to the
    elevated throwing area where amazing distances are achieved. This day
    was no exception as we witnessed a new NCAA record by Gabor Mate of
    Auburn University finishing third overall in the competition. First
    and second were earned by Adam Setliff and Andy Bloom respectively at
    224-9 and 224-7. World Champion, Anthony Washington did not make the
    finals.
    
    
    
    
    
    Saturday saw the rest of the competition, including all the events
    we were scheduled for. We had some remarkable performances given the
    brief time we have been working in Outdoor Track. Chris McGuire '00,
    led the way with an automatic qualifying effort in the 10K. Waiting
    until 6:00PM to race, Chris lost patience quickly with the pack and
    made a move to catch the leader, Ronaldo Da Costa, of Brazil, the 2nd
    fastest marathoner of all time. Chris succeeded in catching him and
    them proceeded to take the lead for the next 4 miles, each under
    5:00. Falling behind in the final 2 laps, Chris nevertheless did not
    slow down, running 73-74 seconds for every lap after the very first
    quarter of the race. Chris finished in second with a time of
    30:56.06.
    
    
    
    
    
    Provisional national qualifying marks were made by Nikos
    Michalakis '01, in the Javelin and Craig Mielcarz '03, in the High
    Jump. Nikos put every throw in the 190-194 range, finishing with a
    194-7 effort. Craig, having hyper-extended his knee in the Long Jump,
    was not certain he would be able to High Jump. Coming in early, Craig
    jumped better as the bar went up. At 6-8 he had plenty of clearance,
    and had a very good attempt at 6-10, but failed to clear that
    height.
    
    
    
    
    
    Other fine efforts were put in by many MIT competitors. Sean
    Montgomery '01, competing in the 800, won with a 1:53.06 performance.
    Our 400 Relay team of Todd Rosenfield '01, Robbie Gray '02, Yuval
    Mazor '02, and Marc Washington '03, ran a superb 43.96. The amazing
    part is no one in that foursome can run faster than 11.60 in the open
    100. Not bad for 2 weeks of practice with handoffs.
    
    
    
    
    
    Brian Hoying was nominated by his teammates for the performance of
    the meet, as he cleared 6-6 in the High Jump with a full arm cast due
    to some wrist surgery he had three weeks ago.
    
    
    
    
    
    Freshman, Sean Nolan, put in two fine performances. He ran a
    15:32.76 in the 5000 to lead the day off, and finished the day, 6
    hours later with a 10:04 first time performance in the
    Steeplechase.
    
    
    
    
    
    Overall, we qualified 3 for nationals, and 6 for the New England
    Division III Championship. Next week we start the regular season with
    a home meet versus RPI and WPI in the Engineer's Cup

    **MEN'S TRACK AND FIELD LEAVES MEET
    EARLY** **DUE TO POOR WEATHER CONDITIONS**
    
    
    
    April 21, 2000
    
    
    
    
    
    The weather in Springfield, MA at the Vern Cox Invitational was
    the cause for some teams not to show up at all, and others to pull
    competitors out of events due to safety concerns. MIT coach Halston
    Taylor, sent his team home after four events, indicating that one
    week before the start of a series of championships was too close to
    risk injuries and illness in a meet that was non-scoring. Rain
    pooring down, cold temperatures in the 40s, and gusting winds were
    too much in a meet schedule that was predicted to be at least 4 1/2
    hours in length.
    
    
    
    
    
    The purpose of this meet for MIT was to improve performances to
    qualify for the various championships upcoming in the next 5 weeks.
    Tech jumpers started things off in the Long Jump with marks that
    could hardly be called improved performances. Robbie Gray '02, Craig
    Mielcarz '03, and Junius Ho '01, all jumping 21' 6" or better this
    year, could do no better than 20' 2". In addition, the jumpers, in
    hopes of getting out of the rain, were just huddling under an
    umbrella inbetween jumps rather than properly prepare for their next
    effort. Although they all made the finals, the team left prior to the
    start of those finals.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 3000 Steeplechase was the first running event. Phil Loiselle
    '01, and Craig Wildman '03, made the most of the situation and ran
    well. Craig ran a personal best with a 10:26 effort. MIT withdrew
    their 400 Relay team in fear of pulled muscles then ran all middle
    distance and distance runners in the 1500 before leaving for
    home.
    
    
    
    
    
    Nikos Michalakis '01, competed in the first round of the Javelin
    at the same time the Long Jumpers were competing. Nikos managed a
    180' 2" effort despite the conditions, but was certainly in risk of
    injury during the plant and block phase of his throw, and held plenty
    in reserve.
    
    
    
    
    
    Coach Taylor said it was the first time in his 21 years of
    coaching that he has had a team leave a meet before it was over. "One
    other time in poor weather conditions I resisted the urge to pull my
    team and we lost our two best sprinters for the remainder of the
    season with severe muscle pulls. I could see this happening again,
    and 1 week prior to the start of our championships made it not worth
    the risk."
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT returns to Springfield to defend their crown as
    NEWMAC Champions against a favored Springfield team that is always
    tough at home.
