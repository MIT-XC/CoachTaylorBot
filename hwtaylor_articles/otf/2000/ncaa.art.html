<P>May 25-27, 2000</P>

<P>The MIT Men's Track and Field team qualified three individuals for
the 2000 Outdoor Championships held at North Central College in
Naperville, IL. Two were seeded to score and earn All-American
honors, and one was not. Chris McGuire '00, the one not seeded to
score, closed his MIT career in style, placing 5th in the 10,000
meter race with a huge personal best of 30:41.98, earning
All-American honors. Nikos Michalakis '01, and Sean Montgomery '01,
failed to make the finals in their events.</P>

<P>Sean was the first to participate for MIT as the 1500 trials were
scheduled for the first day. Sean was in the 2nd of two heats, which
would qualify the top 4 from each plus the next 4 fastest times. The
first heat was quite slow with the times ranging from 3:55-4:01.
Seeded third overall, Sean was willing to sit in the back of the pack
and sprint home on the final lap. However, the pace was incredibly
slow at 66 for the first 400 and 2:12 at the half. The pack moved
during the 3rd quarter as they ran a 61 split. Sean moved to 4th and
then dropped back to 7th, unable to keep up. Sean finished with a sub
par 3:58.17. After the race both he and his coach came to the
conclusion that the slow pace had Sean running flat, taking the
strength out of his legs. "He was definitely ready to win it", said
Coach Halston Taylor. "He ran 3:50 and 1:52 in the past two weeks and
had prepared and rested properly since then".</P>

<P>Later in the evening, with the sun and heat not so intense, Chris
took to the track. Seeded 15th, Chris's goal was to place in the top
6, a lofty goal. The pace for the first three miles was quite
consistent (4:58, 4:55, 4:57) with no one wanting to take a chance
too early. The fourth mile was significantly faster as Colin Young,
the eventual winner, picked up the pace, thus stringing out the
field. Chris made the move to stay with the 3rd group, consisting of
places 5th-8th. His fourth mile was in 4:49, and he was moving up to
the 3rd and 4th place runners. The fifth and sixth miles were back
around 4:58 pace as the runners were showing signs of fatigue. Chris
had moved into a solid group of 4, who were vying for 3rd place. With
3 laps to go, 1 runner dropped from the pack, and with 1 lap to go,
the group took off. Chris finished with a 64 final 400 and still got
beat by the other two runners, finishing 5th in 30:41.98, a 15 second
personal best. His time was good for 3rd on the all time MIT
list.</P>

<P>On Saturday, Nikos was up in the Javelin trials. Nikos had flown
in the night before as he had some personal matters to attend to.
This did not allow for him to get accustomed to the throwing surface
or wet conditions. Looking good in his warmups, the feeling was that
he would at least match his 5th place finish from 1999. However, on
his first attempt, Nikos slipped on the wet surface and fouled what
would have been a 200+ throw. On his second attempt, he got a fair
throw in, but it was nothing more than that as he again slipped. On
his final effort in the trials, he had a pretty good throw, but was
not able to "block" very well for fear of slipping again. His best
effort of 184-4 did not make finals.</P>

<P>As more and more of the NAIA and Division II colleges migrate
towards Division III, the standards for making nationals continue to
become more difficult. The NCAA has not raised the number of
qualifiers from approximately 16 per event, which is the reason that
Sean Montgomery did not make the 800 field, despite his 1:52.20
performance.</P>
