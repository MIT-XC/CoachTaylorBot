              <p><span class="headline">MIT HAS IMPRESSIVE SHOWING TO REMAIN UNDEFEATED</span></p>
              <p align="left">April 10, 2010</p>
              <p align="left">Despite very high winds, which at times exceeded 30 mph, MIT athletes performed very well, setting personal bests in many events, including the lap events. They were cheered on by some of the seventy admitted track and cross country prefrosh who were there for Campus Preview Weekend. The women won every running event against <a href="mittri.res.php">Bates College and Colby College</a> as they won with 167 points to 129 for Bates and 109 for Colby. The men won every running event but the 100 meter dash, an event where MIT sat out Stephen Morton '10, and top sprinters Rene Peters '13, and Chazz Sims '13, tweaked their hamstrings prior to the event, leaving MIT nearly void of sprinters. The Engineer's effort saw them finish in first with 201.5 points to 139 for Bates and 60.5 for Colby.</p>
              <p align="left">In the women's meet, MIT was concerned about Bates' strength in the throwing and jumping events and their overall depth. The concern with Colby was their strength in all the field events and their overall balance. Both teams have much larger rosters than MIT and with there being six scoring places (7-5-4-3-2-1), winning the event would not necessarily be enough to score more points than another team. </p>
              <p align="left">As expected things did not start well, as Bates outscored MIT 16-1 in the hammer and 12 to 4 in the shot put. In the long jump, an event MIT expected to do well in, Bates outscored MIT 12-1 and it looked like it was going to be a very long day. About this time, the running events began and Maggie Lloyd '12, took MIT's first victory, claiming the steeplechase in 11:55.33 despite all five runners doing their best not to take the lead. Lloyd took off after three laps, running her best paced race ever. However, Bates still scored 4 to MIT's 7 and Colby claimed the other three places for 10 points.</p>
              <p align="left">Despite the very strong winds, MIT tied their season best in the 4x100, running 49.68 for the victory. But again, with Bates scoring 4 and Colby 3 to MIT's 7, ground was simply not being made up fast enough. In the 1500, Jacqui Wentz '10, returned from her stress reaction suffered on February 6, claiming a very hard fought victory in the 1500, running 4:47.40. Alina Gatowski and Chandler Burfield took third and sixth places respectively to give MIT some much needed points.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 100HH, Portia Jones '12, got a great start, and was so surprised at her speed that she did not realize until too late that she was too close to the hurdle. She smashed into hurdle one, recovered a bit and then hit hurdle two, taking her out of the race. Fortunately, Hazel Briner '11, came through with the victory and Holly Chamberlain '13, took fourth.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT was starting to catch up and the high jump helped. Jones led Briner, Diana Zhu '13, and Victoria Okuneye '13, to a 2-3-4-5 finish for a big 14 points. Jones jump of 5-1 was an outdoor personal best. She may have been able to clear 5-3, but she had to leave for the 100, an event she has never run for MIT. However, she showed that perhaps she should run it more often as she set a new MIT record of 12.63 in taking the victory. Margaret Leibovic '10, claimed second.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT got set back again, as Bates took the javelin, outscoring Tech 12-1. Fortunately, in the discus, Juls Andren '10, came through with a personal best throw of 114-6 to earn third and Colby helped out by claiming 12 of the other points.</p>
              <p align="left">Back on the track, Jamie Simmons '12, and Martha Gross '12, ran outdoor personal bests in the 400, placing first and second respectively with times of 57.95 and 58.68. This was particularly impressive as they had to fight a very strong wind on the backstretch.</p>
              <p align="left">The final two field events, the triple jump and the pole vault, were events MIT was counting on. In the triple jump, Karin Fisher '11, came through with a new personal best, jumping 34-6 1/4, but MIT only managed to earn one other point.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT gradually began to pull ahead as they continued to claim running victories. Alicia Kaestli '12, ran the best race of her career, taking the race in 2:21.81. Lloyd and Gatowski came back with great times to get fifth and sixth. Jones returned to the track to win the 400IH and Kirsten Aarsvold supported with a fourth place.</p>
              <p align="left">The final three running events put MIT in front for good. Gross, Simmons and Leibovic owned the 200, running 25.78, 26.09 and 26.49 respectively to place 1-2-4. Tania Morimoto '12, blasted a 5:37 final mile to easily win the 5000 in 18:19.03. Sarah Sprague '13, and Lauren Allen '13, ran personal bests to earn third (18:56.36) and sixth (19:01.49). The 4x400 team of Aarsvold, Gross, Simmons and Wentz claimed a solid victory in 4:03.18.</p>
              <p align="left">If there was any doubt as to the outcome of the meet, the pole vaulters shut that door, taking all six places led by Fisher with a jump of 11-3 3/4. Briner took second, Lauren Kuntz '13, took third, Caroline Figgatt '11, placed fourth in a personal best of 10-4, Leslie Meyer '13, claimed fifth and Lynn Jepsen '11, took the final scoring place.</p>
              <p align="left">In the men's meet, all plans were thrown off when the University of Southern Maine called an hour before the meet stating they would not be able to attend due to complications with their bus. Southern Maine has a team that could have possibly won the meet and would have certainly changed the outcome of the meet. The meet was reseeded and the scoring changed from eight scoring places to six.</p>
              <p align="left">Bates is very strong in the throwing events and had a lot of depth overall, which was a concern to MIT. Even though MIT is also strong in the throwing events, Bates was able to outscore MIT 57 to 28. Nevertheless, Tech throwers did well, having quite a few personal bests, particularly in the hammer. Tony McDonald '10, Ken Cooper '13, and Adam Mustafa '11, all had personal bests, placing third, fifth and sixth.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT was able to balance things out in the field events with the jumps, outscoring Bates 49.5 to 20.5, making the field events a wash as both teams scored 77.5 points. Morton won his specialties, the long jump and triple jump, although his marks were quite modest for him, 22-3 and 45-8 1/2. Rene Peters '13, got in a 20-3 1/2 jump for third place before tweaking his hamstring, which would also take him out of the 4x100 and 100. Jackson Wirekoh '13, placed in both jumps, adding a fourth in the long jump and a second in the triple jump. Matt Falk '12, helped his team by placing second and Travis Hery '11, chipped in with a fourth place. As with the women, the pole vault was MIT's big event as Greg Tao '10, led Cyrus Vafadari '12, Yida Gao '13, and Ian Fischer '12, to a 1-2-3-4 finish at 15-3, 14-3 1/4, 13-9 1/4 and 13-3 1/2 respectively.</p>
              <p align="left">Unlike the women, the men had depth to go along with all of their running victories. Paul Welle '11, and Richard Prevost '11, running behind the leader for the first three quarters, surged after the 1200 mark, both went unchallenged to an easy 1-2 finish in 9:43.37 and 9:46.51.</p>
              <p align="left">Nathan Peterson '12, stepped in for Peters on the 4x100 and there did not seem to be any difference as MIT pulled even on the second and third legs by Josh Duncavage and Nick Leonard. Morton received the baton perfectly, not losing any speed through the zone, and pulled away to bring the team home first in 43.14, a fine time in the high winds.</p>
              <p align="left">Yermie Cohen '10, led Bill Phipps '10, and Stephen Serene '12, in the 1500 to a 1-4-5 finish. After following the pack through the first 800, Cohen ran a 63 third quarter to pull away and put the victory away with a 44 last 300, with 100 of that right into the high winds. </p>
              <p align="left">The high hurdles were perhaps the biggest surprise for the Engineers. Brian Djaja '13, was unable to run due to a nagging knee problem, but Andrew Musacchio '11, Leonard and Duncavage were able to claim the top three spots. All three ran personal bests, timing 15.74, 15.79 and 16.31.</p>
              <p align="left">Another surprise victory came in the 400. Relaxing on the backstretch and not fighting the wind, DJ Ronde '13, brought the victory home with a 51.86. Kahlil Dozier '12, and Matt Barron '13, were able to support with third and sixth place finishes.</p>
              <p align="left">After MIT got blanked in the 100, Pat Marx '13, walked down teammate Cohen in the 800 to post excellent times of 1:55.65 and 1:56.07. Welle and Prevost doubled up and added a fourth and sixth.</p>
              <p align="left">Leonard and Duncavage returned to the 400IH to place 1-2. Again the times were quite good given the wind. Leonard pulled away after the 300 mark, claiming the victory with a 56.63. Duncavage faded a bit in the final 100, but ran a personal best of 58.22.</p>
              <p align="left">Morton came back to run the 200 and ran a season best to win in 21.94. Dozier placed fourth in 22.89.</p>
              <p align="left">The 5000 was a great race. Hemu Arumugam '10, and Ben Mattocks '12, ignored the wind and took the pace out, intending to qualify for the New England Division III Championship, which required a 15:35 performance. Arumugam led start to finish, running miles of 4:56, 4:58 and 4:49 before closing in 30 seconds for the final 200 to win in 15:13.90. Mattocks fell slightly off pace after 2 1/4 miles, but still qualified, placing second with 15:23.29. Dmitrij Petters '13, ran a personal best of 15:55.68 to place fourth and Jack Bourbonnais '10, finished sixth.</p>
              <p align="left">The 4x400 was the final touch. Ronde, Duncavage, Leonard and Marx ran 3:27.26 to easily win. Marx finished in 49.4 while Leonard added a 51.0 leg.</p>
              <p align="left">Next week MIT is host to the MIT Spring Invitational, the final meet before the NEWMAC Conference Championship. The meet starts at noon.</p>
