    TECH TRACK CONTINUES TO STEP UP WITH NCAA QUALIFYING PERFORMANCES 
    
    
                  
    
    May 13-14, 2010
    
    
                  
    
    While MIT used the ECAC Division III Championship as a national qualifier, resting some, attempting to get better NCAA marks from others and attempting to get some who had not qualified to the magical marks.
    
    
                  
    
    The women managed to win four events despite the reserved team effort and had four improved NCAA performances. Hazel Briner '11, started things off with the heptathlon. While Briner did not have any personal bests until her amazing 2:19.49 800 finale, she still managed a new PR and MIT record in winning the event with a score of 4378 points, which currently has her ranked 16th on the NCAA Division III list.
    
    
                  
    
    Also on the first day, Jacqui Wentz '10, ran the 3000 steeplechase, figuring she would need to improve on her 10:50 performance from earlier in the season. Improve she did, running the second fastest time in the country with her new MIT record of 10:22.32 for a twenty seven second victory.
    
    
                  
    
    Tania Morimoto '12, took to the track in the 10K, an event where her previous qualifying performance of 37:01 would not get her to nationals. The early pace was quick and Morimoto wanted to ease into it so she began with a 90 second first lap, eased into 89 second quarters to come through the 1600 in 5:56. Moving the pace up to 87s, Morimoto slowly reeled in the lead pack, catching them before the half way point. With four laps to go she took the lead, trying to win. Her 85 second lap opened up a five meter gap, but she was not able to hold the pace, eventually holding on for third in a 27 second PR of 36:34.11. A time that moves her to number 24 on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    On day two, the 4x100 got the Engineers underway. Unfortunately, MIT was unable to improve on their best performance due to two poor handoffs. Despite the mishaps the quartet of Margaret Leibovic '10, Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12 and Portia Jones '12, put together a time of 48.66 for third place, showing they have the ability to run under 48 seconds if they put three handoffs together.
    
    
                  
    
    Portia Jones entered the 100HH as the second seed. However, after a great start and a sprint intensity she has never shown before, Jones never saw another competitor after leaving the blocks, running 14.44 for the victory despite absolutely no wind.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT had no one else competing until the 400IH. Jones, having only run a 65 thus far in the season, and not a chance of qualifying for nationals with that time, knew she had to run a great time. However, due to her slower qualifying time, she was in the second of three sections. This did not matter as Jones screamed through a high 28 first 200, running flawlessly. She stretched to reach hurdles six and seven, slowing down on the hurdles. This caught up with her on the final three, but she nevertheless finished with a 61.34 performance, a new MIT record and second best on the NCAA list. Simmons, already number four on the list, was hoping to get out and run the sub 61 she is capable of. She looked great though three hurdles then seemed to totally lose her rhythm, having difficulty on every hurdle and finishing with a 65.04.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's final event was the 4x400. Already with the third fastest time in the country, MIT did not need to try to run faster. What was more important was to try to see who the best fourth leg would be to join Jones, Simmons and Gross. After Simmons led off with a new personal best of 56.4 leg, Wentz came back from the steeplechase and showed she is multi-talented as she cruised to a 58.1 leg and seemed to have plenty left at the end. Kirsten Aarsvold '11, who ran a 59 split last weekend, was only able to provide a 61.4 leg this time around. Gross got the baton, trying a little too hard to catch the leader and faded a bit on the homestretch to give her a 58.0 anchor for a 3:54.07 total time, good for second place. 
    
    
                  
    
    The men left many of their top performers at home such as Yermie Cohen '10, and Paul Welle '11, as well as sending Stephen Morton '10, down to the IC4A Championship at Princeton University.
    
    
                  
    
    Vlad Sobes '11, and James Oleinik '10, led the way for the Engineers, both claiming second place. Sobes threw 193-0 for runner-up honors in the javelin while Oleinik tossed the shot 50-0 on his final throw to claim second.
    
    
                  
    
    Mitch Kelley '11, had the only personal best for the men, throwing 157-7 in the discus for fourth place and 33rd on the NCAA qualifying list. This new mark moved Kelley to third on the all-time MIT list. 
    
    
                  
    
    Greg Tao '10, had a sub par performance in the pole vault and was thus unable to move up on his NCAA 16th ranked spot with his early season 15-11 vault. Nevertheless he earned a fifth place with his 15-5 clearance.
    
    
                  
    
    Richard Prevost '11, dropped back suddenly after the 1600 mark of the 3000 steeplechase, going from running 74 second quarters to 79, 82 and 84 second final three 400s for a sixth place 9:37.84 finish.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT earned two seventh places, one by Kelley in the shot put with his 47-6 1/4 put and the other by Dan Harper '12, running 15:19.55 in the hot and humid conditions.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT hosts a true NCAA approved Last Chance Qualifier on Friday, May 21 at noon. This will be the final day anyone is permitted to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship.

    MIT MEN AND WOMEN TAKE VICTORIES IN ENGINEER'S CUP 
    
    
                  
    
    April 3, 2010 
    
    
                  
    
    In near 80 degree temperatures and high winds, MIT successfully defended the Engineer's Cup in Troy, NY, home of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in the annual tri meet pitting MIT against RPI and WPI. The men overwhelmed their competition by a score of 176 to 133 for RPI and 96 for WPI with the scoring format of 7-5-4-3-2-1 for first through six places. The MIT women held on to a 149.5 to 139.5 victory over RPI with WPI posting 107 points for third. The MIT women succeeded despite only competing 25 athletes.
    
    
                  
    
    On the men's side, MIT won seven of the 11 running events and three of the eight field events. For the women, MIT also won seven of the 11 running events, but only one of the field events, that being the pole vault. 
    
    
                  
    
    MIT moved some runners around to different events, particularly on the men's side where the larger roster allowed such flexibility. Continuing to dominate, Stephen Morton '10, won his three events as well as anchored the winning 4x100 relay team. Despite the strong tail wind, Morton showed he thrives more on competition than conditions. His winning efforts in the long and triple jumps were 23-1 3/4 and 47-1 1/2 respectively, far from his best. Keeping him out of the 100 to give him a small rest, Morton did run the 200, winning in 22.67.
    
    
                  
    
    Despite Morton not racing in the 100 meter dash, Rene Peters '13, made certain MIT would not lose the points, coming away with an excellent 11.07 victory. Peters also ran the leadoff leg in the successful 4x100.
    
    
                  
    
    Pat Marx '13, moved from the 800 to the 400, with the same results, a victory. Marx ran a come from behind 50.36 in the strong winds. Marx also dropped down to the 200, earning a fourth place with a time of 22.85.
    
    
                  
    
    Paul Welle '11, moved from his favorite event, the steeplechase, to the 1500 and 800, and came away with two victories. In the 1500, Welle took off after the first 400 went out in a pedestrian 68 seconds, leading his teammates; Richard Prevost '11, Ben Mattocks '12, and Hemu Arumugam '10, to a 1-2-3-4 finish with times of 4:05.72, 4:06.40, 4:08.11 and 4:09.87 respectively. In the 800, the results were similar, with Welle braving the strong winds on the backstretch to win in 1:58.89. Stephen Serene '12, and Bill Phipps '10, supported with second and third place finishes in 1:59.18 and 1:59.20.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's other track victory was earned by Yermie Cohen '10, who moved up to the 5000. Although Cohen tried to run a reasonably fast time, the strong backstretch winds were just too much, forcing him to slow in the last mile, finishing in 15:36.49. Dan Harper '12, supported with a second place performance of 15:43.79.
    
    
                  
    
    In addition to Morton's two horizontal jump victories, James Oleinik 'G, led the MIT shot putters to a 1-2-3-4 finish with a throw of 48-7 1/4. Mitch Kelley '11, threw 46-6 3/4 for second place, while Tony McDonald '10, threw 45-0 1/4 for third place and Ken Cooper '13, put the shot 44-2 3/4 for fourth.
    
    
                  
    
    For the women, many carried the load, but Portia Jones '12, was the only MIT athlete with two victories, earning first place in the 100HH with a time of 14.68 and a 65.75 performance in the 400IH. She also anchored the winning 4x100 team, who combined to run a time of 49.88. Hazel Briner '11, did not win any events, but she led all MIT scorers with 21 points. Briner earned a second place in the pole vault with a leap of 11-5 3/4. On her final attempt at 11-11 3/4, in what looked to be a good vault, her pole broke, slapping her in the leg in the process. Briner also placed third in the long jump with a personal best of 17-2, third in the 100HH with a 15.81, fourth in the shot put with a 35-7 3/4 toss, fourth in the 200 in 26.87 and fifth in the high jump with a clearance of 4-11.
    
    
                  
    
    Jamie Simmons '12, moved from the 400IH to the 400 with similar results as she won in 59.03. Simmons also ran a strong leg on the 4x100 relay and led off the 4x400 with an excellent 58.5 leg.
    
    
                  
    
    Alicia Kaestli '12, returned to winning ways, taking the 800 by moving into the lead early and holding on for a 2:24.46 victory. Alina Gatowski '11, who won the 1500 in a personal best of 4:50.01, supported Kaestli with a second place in 2:24.53.
    
    
                  
    
    Maggie Lloyd '12, took the lead at the start of the 3000 Steeplechase and never relinquished it, winning in 12:02.34.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's final victory was in the final event, the pole vault. Karin Fisher '11, who also jumped to a personal best of 34-2 1/4 in the triple jump to earn second place, won the vault with a 11-5 3/4 effort, beating Briner on misses.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT hosts their first home meet of the outdoor season. The men take on Bates, Colby and Southern Maine while the women do battle with Bates and Colby. Both meets begin at noon on Saturday, 4/10.

    MIT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HOME LAST CHANCE QUALIFIER
    
    
                  
    
    Six Improved NCAA Qualifying Marks, Two MIT Records, Eight Personal Bests Showcase MIT's Efforts 
    
    
                  
    
    May 21 , 2010
    
    
                  
    
    MIT was fortunate to host the NCAA approved Last Chance Qualifier for the New England region, and the MIT track and field performers took advantage of the situation. Given that MIT was in their last day of final exams it would have been nearly impossible for MIT to have competed at any other facility. Only those already qualified for the NCAA Division III Championship next week, or those who were really close to doing so were representing MIT. Over 20 teams from throughout the region and New York were represented in the meet, which only lasted two and a half hours. Relatively small fields, a rolling time schedule and a facility that aids in efficient meet management enabled the very quick meet. 
    
    
                  
    
    MIT entered 13 events in the men's and women's meet and won every one of them. MIT performers competed at an amazingly high level, producing six improved NCAA qualifying marks, two women's records and eight personal bests en route to one of the best competitive efforts in MIT history.
    
    
                  
    
    Jacqui Wentz '10, displayed her talents once again by demolishing the field in the 1500. Despite the windy conditions Wentz took the lead at the start, running splits of 70, 2:21 and 3:33 as she closed with a 52 final 300 to finish in an MIT record and NCAA leading time of 4:25.43.
    
    
                  
    
    Portia Jones '12, employed a similar strategy in the 400, making up the stagger halfway through the first turn and never looking back as she too set an MIT record of 55.83, the third fastest time in the country so far. Also in the race, Martha Gross '12, ran a very competitive 58.38 and Kirsten Aarsvold '11, set a personal best with her 61.45.
    
    
                  
    
    Karin Fisher '11, moved up to number  14 on the NCAA list, good enough to make it into the national field that will be vaulting on Thursday at 1:00 at Baldwin Wallace College in Berea, OH. Her vault of 12-2 1/2 won the event while Hazel Briner '11, cleared 11-0 3/4 and Lauren Kuntz '13, made 10-6 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Three other victories were earned by the Lady Engineers. Jamie Simmons '12, won the 400IH, as she ran a very respectable 63.04 in the strong wind. Jones came back in the 200 only about 30 minutes after her 400 record and ran 24.81. Gross also came back in the 200, running 25.99, while Briner ran 26.78. The 4x100 team of Margaret Leibovic '10, Gross, Simmons and Jones made an effort to improve their NCAA qualifying time by enough to make it into the selected field but it was not to be as they only ran a 48.70, which was good enough for the victory.
    
    
                  
    
    For the men, their were three personal bests to go along with the seven victories. Mitch Kelley '11, had the most impressive performance, throwing nearly a six foot personal best in the discus to win in 163-4, moving him up to number 22 on the NCAA list and number two on the MIT all-time list.
    
    
                  
    
    Yermie Cohen '10, ran a 1:53.45 PR to win the 800. Cohen went out in 55, took over the lead and sprinted home against the challenging wind. Already the number one seed on the NCAA list in the 1500, Cohen was just getting a tune-up prior to the national championship. 
    
    
                  
    
    Greg Tao '10, finally put together the vault day he is capable of, setting a new personal best of 16-1 1/4 to move up to number 12 on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Making an effort to improve in the 3000 Steeplechase, Paul Welle '11, was not able to hold a fast early pace as the wind got the best of him. His 9:16.75 was good for the win but not an improvement on his 9:12.22, which at number 20 on the NCAA list does not look promising for gaining selection.
    
    
                  
    
    Stephen Morton '10, needed to improve his mark in the triple jump and wanted to have a few good long jumps as well. All three of his long jumps were well over 23', with his best fair jump being 23-7 1/4 for the win. He did improve his triple jump even though he was only able to get two of his six jumps in. His winning jump was 48-0 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    James Oleinik 'G, did not improve his 52-5 1/2 shot put, which has him at 25th on the NCAA list, but he did have his second best put ever with his 51-5 victory. Perhaps not the best finish to his competitive career, but pretty darn close.
    
    
                  
    
    The athletes find out on Sunday who is in the NCAA Championship and who is not. The competition begins on Thursday and ends on Saturday.

    MIT HAS IMPRESSIVE SHOWING TO REMAIN UNDEFEATED

    Despite very high winds, which at times exceeded 30 mph, MIT athletes performed very well, setting personal bests in many events, including the lap events. They were cheered on by some of the seventy admitted track and cross country prefrosh who were there for Campus Preview Weekend. The women won every running event against Bates College and Colby College as they won with 167 points to 129 for Bates and 109 for Colby. The men won every running event but the 100 meter dash, an event where MIT sat out Stephen Morton '10, and top sprinters Rene Peters '13, and Chazz Sims '13, tweaked their hamstrings prior to the event, leaving MIT nearly void of sprinters. The Engineer's effort saw them finish in first with 201.5 points to 139 for Bates and 60.5 for Colby.
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's meet, MIT was concerned about Bates' strength in the throwing and jumping events and their overall depth. The concern with Colby was their strength in all the field events and their overall balance. Both teams have much larger rosters than MIT and with there being six scoring places (7-5-4-3-2-1), winning the event would not necessarily be enough to score more points than another team. 
    
    
                  
    
    As expected things did not start well, as Bates outscored MIT 16-1 in the hammer and 12 to 4 in the shot put. In the long jump, an event MIT expected to do well in, Bates outscored MIT 12-1 and it looked like it was going to be a very long day. About this time, the running events began and Maggie Lloyd '12, took MIT's first victory, claiming the steeplechase in 11:55.33 despite all five runners doing their best not to take the lead. Lloyd took off after three laps, running her best paced race ever. However, Bates still scored 4 to MIT's 7 and Colby claimed the other three places for 10 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Despite the very strong winds, MIT tied their season best in the 4x100, running 49.68 for the victory. But again, with Bates scoring 4 and Colby 3 to MIT's 7, ground was simply not being made up fast enough. In the 1500, Jacqui Wentz '10, returned from her stress reaction suffered on February 6, claiming a very hard fought victory in the 1500, running 4:47.40. Alina Gatowski and Chandler Burfield took third and sixth places respectively to give MIT some much needed points.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 100HH, Portia Jones '12, got a great start, and was so surprised at her speed that she did not realize until too late that she was too close to the hurdle. She smashed into hurdle one, recovered a bit and then hit hurdle two, taking her out of the race. Fortunately, Hazel Briner '11, came through with the victory and Holly Chamberlain '13, took fourth.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT was starting to catch up and the high jump helped. Jones led Briner, Diana Zhu '13, and Victoria Okuneye '13, to a 2-3-4-5 finish for a big 14 points. Jones jump of 5-1 was an outdoor personal best. She may have been able to clear 5-3, but she had to leave for the 100, an event she has never run for MIT. However, she showed that perhaps she should run it more often as she set a new MIT record of 12.63 in taking the victory. Margaret Leibovic '10, claimed second.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT got set back again, as Bates took the javelin, outscoring Tech 12-1. Fortunately, in the discus, Juls Andren '10, came through with a personal best throw of 114-6 to earn third and Colby helped out by claiming 12 of the other points.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, Jamie Simmons '12, and Martha Gross '12, ran outdoor personal bests in the 400, placing first and second respectively with times of 57.95 and 58.68. This was particularly impressive as they had to fight a very strong wind on the backstretch.
    
    
                  
    
    The final two field events, the triple jump and the pole vault, were events MIT was counting on. In the triple jump, Karin Fisher '11, came through with a new personal best, jumping 34-6 1/4, but MIT only managed to earn one other point.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT gradually began to pull ahead as they continued to claim running victories. Alicia Kaestli '12, ran the best race of her career, taking the race in 2:21.81. Lloyd and Gatowski came back with great times to get fifth and sixth. Jones returned to the track to win the 400IH and Kirsten Aarsvold supported with a fourth place.
    
    
                  
    
    The final three running events put MIT in front for good. Gross, Simmons and Leibovic owned the 200, running 25.78, 26.09 and 26.49 respectively to place 1-2-4. Tania Morimoto '12, blasted a 5:37 final mile to easily win the 5000 in 18:19.03. Sarah Sprague '13, and Lauren Allen '13, ran personal bests to earn third (18:56.36) and sixth (19:01.49). The 4x400 team of Aarsvold, Gross, Simmons and Wentz claimed a solid victory in 4:03.18.
    
    
                  
    
    If there was any doubt as to the outcome of the meet, the pole vaulters shut that door, taking all six places led by Fisher with a jump of 11-3 3/4. Briner took second, Lauren Kuntz '13, took third, Caroline Figgatt '11, placed fourth in a personal best of 10-4, Leslie Meyer '13, claimed fifth and Lynn Jepsen '11, took the final scoring place.
    
    
                  
    
    In the men's meet, all plans were thrown off when the University of Southern Maine called an hour before the meet stating they would not be able to attend due to complications with their bus. Southern Maine has a team that could have possibly won the meet and would have certainly changed the outcome of the meet. The meet was reseeded and the scoring changed from eight scoring places to six.
    
    
                  
    
    Bates is very strong in the throwing events and had a lot of depth overall, which was a concern to MIT. Even though MIT is also strong in the throwing events, Bates was able to outscore MIT 57 to 28. Nevertheless, Tech throwers did well, having quite a few personal bests, particularly in the hammer. Tony McDonald '10, Ken Cooper '13, and Adam Mustafa '11, all had personal bests, placing third, fifth and sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT was able to balance things out in the field events with the jumps, outscoring Bates 49.5 to 20.5, making the field events a wash as both teams scored 77.5 points. Morton won his specialties, the long jump and triple jump, although his marks were quite modest for him, 22-3 and 45-8 1/2. Rene Peters '13, got in a 20-3 1/2 jump for third place before tweaking his hamstring, which would also take him out of the 4x100 and 100. Jackson Wirekoh '13, placed in both jumps, adding a fourth in the long jump and a second in the triple jump. Matt Falk '12, helped his team by placing second and Travis Hery '11, chipped in with a fourth place. As with the women, the pole vault was MIT's big event as Greg Tao '10, led Cyrus Vafadari '12, Yida Gao '13, and Ian Fischer '12, to a 1-2-3-4 finish at 15-3, 14-3 1/4, 13-9 1/4 and 13-3 1/2 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    Unlike the women, the men had depth to go along with all of their running victories. Paul Welle '11, and Richard Prevost '11, running behind the leader for the first three quarters, surged after the 1200 mark, both went unchallenged to an easy 1-2 finish in 9:43.37 and 9:46.51.
    
    
                  
    
    Nathan Peterson '12, stepped in for Peters on the 4x100 and there did not seem to be any difference as MIT pulled even on the second and third legs by Josh Duncavage and Nick Leonard. Morton received the baton perfectly, not losing any speed through the zone, and pulled away to bring the team home first in 43.14, a fine time in the high winds.
    
    
                  
    
    Yermie Cohen '10, led Bill Phipps '10, and Stephen Serene '12, in the 1500 to a 1-4-5 finish. After following the pack through the first 800, Cohen ran a 63 third quarter to pull away and put the victory away with a 44 last 300, with 100 of that right into the high winds. 
    
    
                  
    
    The high hurdles were perhaps the biggest surprise for the Engineers. Brian Djaja '13, was unable to run due to a nagging knee problem, but Andrew Musacchio '11, Leonard and Duncavage were able to claim the top three spots. All three ran personal bests, timing 15.74, 15.79 and 16.31.
    
    
                  
    
    Another surprise victory came in the 400. Relaxing on the backstretch and not fighting the wind, DJ Ronde '13, brought the victory home with a 51.86. Kahlil Dozier '12, and Matt Barron '13, were able to support with third and sixth place finishes.
    
    
                  
    
    After MIT got blanked in the 100, Pat Marx '13, walked down teammate Cohen in the 800 to post excellent times of 1:55.65 and 1:56.07. Welle and Prevost doubled up and added a fourth and sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    Leonard and Duncavage returned to the 400IH to place 1-2. Again the times were quite good given the wind. Leonard pulled away after the 300 mark, claiming the victory with a 56.63. Duncavage faded a bit in the final 100, but ran a personal best of 58.22.
    
    
                  
    
    Morton came back to run the 200 and ran a season best to win in 21.94. Dozier placed fourth in 22.89.
    
    
                  
    
    The 5000 was a great race. Hemu Arumugam '10, and Ben Mattocks '12, ignored the wind and took the pace out, intending to qualify for the New England Division III Championship, which required a 15:35 performance. Arumugam led start to finish, running miles of 4:56, 4:58 and 4:49 before closing in 30 seconds for the final 200 to win in 15:13.90. Mattocks fell slightly off pace after 2 1/4 miles, but still qualified, placing second with 15:23.29. Dmitrij Petters '13, ran a personal best of 15:55.68 to place fourth and Jack Bourbonnais '10, finished sixth.
    
    
                  
    
    The 4x400 was the final touch. Ronde, Duncavage, Leonard and Marx ran 3:27.26 to easily win. Marx finished in 49.4 while Leonard added a 51.0 leg.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week MIT is host to the MIT Spring Invitational, the final meet before the NEWMAC Conference Championship. The meet starts at noon.

    MIT MEN'S AND WOMEN'S TEAM REACH PODIUM, PLACING 4TH AND 3RD RESPECTIVELY AT NCAA DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP 
    
    
                  
    
    May 27-29 , 2010
    
    
                  
    
    Day one of the NCAA Division III Championships, hosted by Baldwin Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, brought hot temperatures and hot performances from the MIT contingent. MIT ended the day with three school records, an individual long jump title and two additional personal bests. In addition, MIT was five for five in advancing from trials to Saturday's finals in the running events.
    
    
                  
    
    Vlad Sobes '11, started things off in the javelin throw. This was Sobes's first NCAA Championship. In fact, assuming he would not qualify, he took a job in Knoxville, TN that began early in the week. He flew in for the javelin and flew back to his job, all within 24 hours. While in Ohio, Sobes made the most of it. He had an excellent first throw, a new personal best of 200-9. This throw got him in the finals in seventh place. On his second throw in the finals, Sobes popped a 203-10 PR to move him to fourth place. However, in the final round he was passed twice, one by only one centimeter, to finish sixth, just 19 centimeters out of second. Not bad for coming in seeded 15th. 
    
    
                  
    
    At the same time Karin Fisher '11, was busy in the pole vault. Despite having the poles arrive the morning of competition, one day late, and five of the men's and women's poles arriving broken, Fisher was all business. She borrowed the poles she needed and cleared 11-5, then 11-10 3/4, both on the first attempt. At 12-2 3/4, Fisher was unable to clear the new outdoor PR until her third and final attempt. This late clear put her in 10th place. She would need to clear the next height, 12-6 3/4 to place, but she was unable to do so. Nevertheless, seeded 14th and earning 10th place with a personal best was an excellent way to end her junior year. 
    
    
                  
    
    First on the track for MIT was Jacqui Wentz '10, in the 1500. Wentz, seeded first, was in the first of two sections. The top four in each section along with the next four fastest times would advance to Saturday's final. The pace was pedestrian at best as no one wanted to take it out. Going through splits of 78 and 2:36, the pack finally picked up the pace to run a 70 third quarter and then finishing with a 50 final 300 as Wentz easily pulled away with 50 meters to go to win in 4:36.62.
    
    
                  
    
    Yermie Cohen '10, was next, running in the men's 1500. Completely opposite from what the women experienced, the pace went out in 60, 2:04 and 3:06 as Cohen took the lead with 500 to go. Seeded number one, Cohen showed it was valid as he won his heat and had the fastest qualifying time, running 3:50.74.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up for the Engineer's was Jamie Simmons '12, in the 400IH. Simmons, seeded fifth in the field, was in the first of three sections where the winners and next five fastest times would advance. Simmons got out pretty well, somewhat stuttered three of the ten hurdles, but none very badly and lost her balance twice due to over rotating her arms, but did nothing short of setting a stadium record and new MIT record as she not only won her heat but had the fastest overall time of 60.52.
    
    
                  
    
    Greg Tao '10, was up in the pole vault and the three time All America winner was hoping to add number four. Tao cleared 15-5 1/2 on his second attempt, but was unable to clear the money height of 15-11 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Back to the track, Portia Jones '12, was in the 200, her first of four different events, all with trials and potential finals over the three days. Running in the second of three heats and having the outside lane in a race where they were advancing heat winners and the next five fastest times, it was critical for Jones to get out well and run the turn hard. This she did to perfection, coming off the turn in second and holding it the rest of the way to run a new MIT record of 24.28. This time was fourth overall in the event and faster than anyone in the country had run in the regular season. It took a blazing 24.46 to make to the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    At this same time, Stephen Morton '10, was over at the long jump ready to exorcise the long jump demons and take care of unfinished business. After fouling out at the indoor championship this year and making finals last spring only to finish ninth, Morton needed to get a fair jump in, which he did on four of his six jumps, all over seven meters. On his second jump, Morton landed a jump of 23-9 putting him in first after the trials. With virtually no wind, this mark held up through the finals, giving Morton his first national title. 
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x400 trials, MIT, seeded third, was the fastest seed in the third of three heats. With two teams from each heat advancing plus the next two fastest times, MIT just needed to be sure to stay out of trouble. Simmons led things off with a marvelous 55.9 leg to put MIT in the lead. Martha Gross '12, ready to run fast, ran 57.2 and had plenty left as she brought the baton in just behind the lead team. An excellent handoff sent Wentz into the lead. She proceeded to lose the lead, settle and race instead of running her best time until she realized she had a lot left. Pulling ahead at the end of the home stretch, Wentz ran a 58.2 as she handed off to Jones. Jones wanted to get separation and certainly did  as she raced through the first 200 in 25 flat. With a 25 meter lead, Jones allowed the fatigue to creep in as she slowed to finish in 56.2 for a new MIT record of 3:47.74, which proved to be the second fastest time in the competition.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event of the day for MIT was the women's 10K. Alina Gatowski '11, the 16th seed out of 18 runners was never in the race, choosing to run in the back. Gatowski was never engaged in the race, showing a lack of confidence very unlike what she has demonstrated this year. Her 38:45.42 was more than two and half minutes off the mark that got her here. 
    
    
                  
    
    At the end of the day, the men were in third place with 13 points. The women scored no points, but put themselves in good position to score well on Saturday. 
    
    
                  
    
    Day two opened with Jones in the 100HH, an event she entered as the seventh seed with a 14.43 best time. With a great start and excellent sprinting between the hurdles, Jones finished second in her heat, and second overall, with a new MIT record of 14.07 performance. 
    
    
                  
    
    Jones was back 40 minutes later in the 400, her best event by seed as she was the number three seed in the field. However, it was clear as soon as the gun went off that she was not mentally in the race. Jones went through the motions, finishing last in her heat with a 57.66.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up for Tech was the great Jacqui Wentz in the 3000 steeplechase. This was perhaps the most anticipated event of the day as nearly everyone in the know wanted to see what Wentz would do. What she did was follow the plan of letting someone else lead the race through the first four and a half laps and then pull away with 1200 to go. Running 83 second pace as an average through the 1600, Wentz dropped two 81 second quarters and then finished with a 38 last 200 to run an incredible 10:16.16, winning by 14 seconds, which not only was the fastest time in Division III this year, but also made the B standard for the USATF meet and is only four seconds away from the A standard. Needless to say this was a new MIT record.
    
    
                  
    
    The final day of competition began with the triple jump for MIT. Morton had not had a really good triple since indoor nationals. Competing in the second flight with four jumpers in the first flight already over 48-5, Morton made his first jump count, jumping 48-0 to make it into the finals, which included the top nine jumpers from the trials. In the final three rounds, Morton was able to move up to third with an outstanding jump of 49-3. Now that he was in contention and starting to feel it, Morton really brought it on his final attempt, blasting one well over 50'....but he fouled by about one inch. Not seeded to score, third place was pretty remarkable.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track Wentz was back in the 1500 final. Starting in the back and moving up to second place at the end of the 800, it looked as though Wentz was ready to go, but then she seemed to give into the fatigue and not able to respond to the pace picking up. Eventually she fought in the final 100 to earn fifth place in 4:28.91. A slight chink in her armor or was Wentz really fatigued and too tired to come back in the 4x400?
    
    
                  
    
    Cohen was next up on the men's side of the 1500. The pace for the race was crisp, but not too fast. Cohen moved up to second and sat on quarter splits of 62 and 2:07. During the next 400 meters Cohen was preparing to make his move and with just over 300 meters to go he took off. Coming through the 1200 in 3:08, Cohen sped up, opening up a five meter lead with 120 to go, but was passed in the final 100 even though he ran the final 300 in 42 seconds. However, he earned second place in 3:50.72 to give the men a final total of 27 points. Not bad after only being seeded to score 10 points in this championship.
    
    
                  
    
    The 100HH final was next and Jones was ready to go. A great start was followed by four excellent hurdles as Jones was in the lead and looking great. Then she again hit a hurdle with her lead leg, but recovered quickly to still be in a battle for second as she got over the next hurdle clean. However, she then really hit the next hurdle and nearly fell. Her determination held her up enough to finish fifth in 14.29. Even though this was Jones's second fastest time ever, she was obviously disappointed. The great breaks MIT had started the meet with were starting to go the other way.
    
    
                  
    
    A little later Simmons was up in the 400IH final where she was determined to gain a victory. Simmons was running super through six hurdles and seemed ready to deliver the win but suddenly  did not seem to have enough energy to pull away. Instead, she actually fell back to about sixth place before rallying in the final 100 to pull away for a second place finish in 61.01 and a much needed eight points. At this point MIT had 26 points and was around fifth place in the team standings. 
    
    
                  
    
    Jones was up next and a little worried about her leg, which started bothering her after the hurdles. She shook that off and delivered in the 200 final, running 24.28, again, finishing sixth to give MIT 29 points.
    
    
                  
    
    After the 5000 and triple jump, with only one event remaining, MIT was in sixth, two points behind Williams, who also had a team in the 4x400 relay. With Wentz, Simmons and Jones showing a little fatigue, it was time to have a talk and see just how badly they wanted to be one of the top four teams in the meet, all of whom receive a team trophy. Talk is cheap, so the ladies went out and showed how much difference a determined attitude can make. Simmons led off with a 56.1 to put MIT in second place. Gross ran the best leg of her young life, dropping a 56.4 to keep MIT in second. Wentz, not to be outdone, delivered her own personal best, a 57.7 leg to put MIT a close third. Jones got the baton and wasted no time in moving the team into second and setting her sites on Wartburg, one of the teams only three points behind MIT in the team standing and 20 meters in front of her in this race. Jones ran an amazing 54.1 to close within 1.14 seconds and give MIT a second place in 3:44.49 and third place overall with 37 points, their highest finish ever in an NCAA Track and Field Championship. 
    
    
                  
    
    The men's 27 points held on for fourth place overall, also earning a spot on the podium for the first time ever in outdoor history. In addition to this and the 13 All America awards taken away by MIT, Stephen Morton was named the NCAA Field Event Male Athlete of the Meet.
    
    
                  
    
    A remarkable season ending with a remarkable NCAA Championship. What will 2011 bring?

    MIT MEN AND WOMEN FINISH SECOND IN NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
                  
    
    12 New NCAA Qualifying Marks Achieved 
    
    
                  
    
    April 30-May 1, 2010
    
    
                  
    
    Both the men's and women's track & field teams from MIT earned second place finishes at the New England Division III Championships hosted by Tufts University. The men's team, holding onto first place until the final event, where  a one point lead was not enough to keep Williams College at bay, as the Ephs won the 4x400 and MIT settled for a fifth place finish in the event, giving them second place in the meet with 154 points to 159 for Williams. Third place went to Bates College with 66 points. Twenty five of the teams competing scored in the meet. MIT scored 38 more points than they were seeded for. The Tech women were never able to catch up to Williams, trailing them by just a few points over the two day meet. MIT had to settle for second with 120.5 points, 14 more than they were seeded to score and nearly twice the score of third place Springfield College, who had 68, but not close enough to the 157 points that Williams College scored. 
    
    
                  
    
    "This was arguably the best meet I have ever been a part of", said MIT's Coach Taylor when reflecting on the performance of his men's team in their battle with Williams. Having five new or improved NCAA qualifying performances, MIT also had 24 season or personal bests as the inspired Engineers put their best effort forward.
    
    
                  
    
    Things got started on Friday with Stephen Morton '10, getting the winning long jump on his first attempt. Morton popped a season best 23-10 1/2 to move him up in the NCAA Division III rankings to number four in the country. At the same time, Vlad Sobes '11, moved up from his fifth place seed, throwing 190-5 in the javelin into a very strong wind to place third. 
    
    
                  
    
    In the hammer, MIT was not seeded to score. The throwers knew that if MIT were to pull out the team victory, a large part of that success would be on their broad shoulders. Despite his low seed, CK Umachi '12, threw 161-11 to earn a much needed seventh place for two more points.
    
    
                  
    
    At the end of the evening, the 10K runners took to the track. With the wind having died down and the temperatures cooling off a bit, there was nothing holding back the pace of the race. The lead pack stayed together despite the crisp pace of 5:08 miles through the three mile mark. As the race strung out, Hemu Arumugam '10, and Dan Harper '12, stayed competitive, fighting for every position. At the end, Arumugam ran a personal best of 31:56.02 to finish second. Harper ran an excellent race, holding on for a fourth place in 32:17.92. At the end of day one, MIT trailed Williams 40 to 31.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two went about as good as could be expected for MIT. The shot put, the first final, epitomized MIT's competitiveness on this 80 degree day. MIT was seeded to get 11 points with second and sixth place finishes. The throwers built upon the performance by Umachi in the hammer, turning the event into their own little practice session. Mitch Kelley '11, seeded sixth, took the lead with a three foot personal best of 49-9 3/4. James Oleinik 'G, moved into second just behind Kelley and Tony McDonald '10, threw a personal best of 46-11 3/4 to make it into finals. In the finals, Oleinik threw a national qualifying performance of 52-5 1/2 to win the event. The big men were dancing and creating quite the scene, which further fueled the MIT cause. The shot putters earned 19 points and MIT was on their way.
    
    
                  
    
    The first final on the track was the 3000 steeplechase. Defending champion, Richard Prevost '11, was a little sick from a cold, but that did not stop him from running a great race and finishing fourth in 9:27.97. Paul Welle '11, last year's runner-up, took the lead with two and a half laps to go and ran away with the race, running a personal best and improved NCAA qualifying time of 9:15.10. Stephen Serene '12, just picking up the event three weeks ago, again lowered his time, placing seventh in 9:42.48.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x100 relay, MIT without their second best sprinter, Rene Peters '13, nevertheless moved the baton around the track with efficiency, placing fourth in an excellent time of 42.87. Nathan Peterson '12, Josh Duncavage '13, Nick Leonard '11 and Stephen Morton had excellent passes to earn the five points. Unfortunately for Morton, the race was at the same time as his flight of the triple jump. When he returned he was still a bit out of breath, contributing to his fouling his first two jumps. On his third jump he put it together, moving into second place. In the finals, on his last attempt, Morton, as he so often does, took the lead with a jump of 47-6 1/2, an NCAA qualifying mark. The next jumper, Tomas Kearney of Williams, who had been in the lead, then passes Morton by a centimeter. The final jumper who was leading after the trials, took back the lead, winning with a 48-01 3/4 jump. 
    
    
                  
    
    On the infield the pole vaulters were finishing their event and MIT, as usual, was playing a prominent role in the results. Davey Hunt '12, jumped a personal best 14-5 1/4 to place eighth in the quality field. Nathan Peterson '12, and Cyrus Vafadari '12, both performed brilliantly to vault 14-11 and place fifth and sixth respectively. Greg Tao '10, was in fourth place as he was the last of four to clear 15-5. However, in true Tao fashion, he was the only one to clear 15-11 to secure the victory and give MIT the much needed 18 points.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, Yermie Cohen '10, ran a great race in the very loaded 1500 field. With fifteen entries in the fast section, the contact was significant and avoiding getting caught up in the fray was important. The initial pace of 63 for the first quarter slowed to a 2:09 800, which clumped the field, forcing runners out into lane three and four. Finally the pace picked up with a sixty second third quarter and continued to speed up as the leaders sprinted for the finish. Cohen was in this group and nearly pulled out the victory, but he ended up in third with a personal best 3:51.92, .36 out of first.
    
    
                  
    
    Andrew Musacchio '11, picked up where he left off at the indoor championship, and qualified for the finals with a great PR of 15.55. Going into the finals, the team was excited that Musacchio was in and going to score at least one point if he finished, but he would have none of that. Instead of settling for his spot in the finals, Musacchio ran another personal best, a 15.30, good for fifth place.
    
    
                  
    
    Morton returned in the finals of the 100, an event in which he was seeded fifth, but not taking into consideration so many events prior to that final. Morton ignored his tired body, placing fourth with a 10.98 performance.
    
    
                  
    
    The 800 was an event MIT was hoping would be a big plus for moving up in the point total. Seeded only third, Pat Marx '13, ran an excellent race in the packed field, splitting 57 for the first quarter before getting boxed in for part of the second lap. Moving back and then out, Marx made his patented move for the finish, which ended in a second place personal best of 1:53.52. Cohen doubled back after the 1500 and ran an excellent personal best of 1:54.04 to pick up five big points for fourth place.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 400IH, Nick Leonard put it all together, racing a big personal best of 54.91 to move himself from his sixth seed to place third. Duncavage, running out of the second section, won his section in a personal best 56.10 to earn seventh overall and earn two more points for Tech.
    
    
                  
    
    In the first event where MIT did not pick up what was expected, the discus throw was at a point in the meet where the throwers were emotionally spent. Kelley made finals but was unable to get that big throw that had him seeded third, forcing him to settle for seventh with 141-6 in the qualify field. 
    
    
                  
    
    In the 200, Morton again brought his tired body to the track and the result was what everyone has come to expect from Morton--his best. He not only placed second, he ran a personal best of 21.82.
    
    
                  
    
    Arumugam and Harper returned  to join Ben Mattocks '12, in the 5000 to try to maintain MIT's 20 point lead. The field was large and Williams had five quality runners in the field, most doubling back from the 1500, steeplechase or 10K. The pace was never slow as the leaders took it out hard. Arumugam, fighting to stay in the back of the second pack came through the 1600 in 4:51 and the 3200 in 9:44. The pace picked up from there and Arumugam did everything he could but could only manage eighth in a season best 15:11.33. Harper closed with a lot of speed, but it was too little, too late as he finished out of the scoring in a personal best of 15:13.08. Williams earned 18 points to pull them within three.
    
    
                  
    
    The 4x800 was next with the 4x400 to follow. Being short of quality 400 runners, but not short at all of 800 runners, MIT put Marx in the 4x400 and went with a fresh Bill Phipps '10 and Logan Daum '11 to join Dawit Zewdie '13, and Cohen to run the 4x800. Phipps battled the leadoff Williams runner for first, handing off nearly at the same time with a fine 1:56.5 leg. Zewdie held his own, although he finished behind Williams with his own 1:56.7. Daum fell behind in the final 200, but finished well to run a 1:58.7 split. Cohen saved his best for last as he closed hard on the Williams competitor, making up nearly all of the 15 meter deficit, finishing .65 back with a 1:53.2 split.
    
    
                  
    
    Going into the final event, ahead by one point, MIT and Williams were both in the second fastest section of the 4x400 relay. However, with scratches from two teams, Williams was one of the teams that moved into the fast section, leaving MIT to defend that one point without the benefit of racing the team trying to catch them. MIT won their section, and even though MIT ran a personal best of 3:23.58 with Leonard (51.2), DJ Ronde (51.1), Duncavage (51.3) and Marx (49.3), it was no match for Williams running 3:17.58 to win the fast section and take the team title.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's meet did not have quite the drama, but was nevertheless a very exciting meet as the ladies put on quite a show with seven new NCAA qualifying marks. On Friday, the only events MIT was competing in were the first day of the heptathlon and the 10K. Hazel Briner '11, had a solid first day, but nothing spectacular as she was in second at the end of the day. She ran a 15.67 hurdle performance, a 4-10 1/4 clearance in the high jump, a 34-1 1/4 in the shot put and a 26.67 in the 200.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 10K, Alina Gatowski '11, did not follow the plan, which was to run from behind and only run fast enough to beat all non-MIT competitors. Instead she chose to lead her teammate, Tania Morimoto '12, to help her run a faster NCAA qualifying performance than her 37:01.55. Since there was not the sense of competition for Gatowski, she had no adrenalin and she fell off pace after just 3200 in 11:49. Morimoto held on for another mile, but then she also fell off pace. Katrina Gravel of Colby, ran a conservative pace and soon passed both women en route to an easy victory in 37:14.74. Gatowski held on for second, but Morimoto faded to sixth. Sarah Sprague '13, ran a great race, running a personal best and outkicking two runners from Williams to secure seventh place in 39:03.81. MIT was seeded to place 1-2-6, so the point loss was significant.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two began much better than day one ended. In the steeplechase, Jacqui Wentz '10, did what she needed to do, which was to just win the event. Wentz pulled away from the relatively slow pace with two and a half laps to go to win easily in 11:07.42. Maggie Lloyd '12, ran a great race, improving nine seconds to a sixth place in 11:31.93.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x100, the quartet of Margaret Leibovic '10, Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12, and Portia Jones '12, had outstanding handoffs, maintained the speed of the baton through the zones and ran a personal best and new MIT record of 48.44, good for third place. This time also moved them up on the NCAA qualifying list. 
    
    
                  
    
    Jones was the next competitor for MIT, earning a spot in the finals of the 100HH. Despite a poor start, Jones ran the fastest final 50, closing well to earn second in another personal best of 14.43. This time moved Jones to number four on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Immediately afterwards, Jones was up in the 400 where she was the defending champion. Joining her were teammates Simmons and Gross. Jones unfortunately drew lane eight so she could not see her competitors until the final straight, at which point she lost focus and faded down the stretch. Simmons came on strong and closed to third in a personal best of 57.08, just ahead of Jones in fourth. Gross ran a personal best of 57.95 to place sixth. Simmons time moved her to number 14 on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Wentz doubled back in the 800, but her 2:17 seed was only good enough to get her in the second fastest section. This lack of forethought on the part of the seeding committee was the loss of the fast section. Wentz was fortunate to have another runner take the pace out hard in 64. Wentz stayed close in 65 and slowly worked her way to the front, taking the lead in the final 150 to win her section in 2:12.92. The fast section was unable to match that performance, giving Wentz the win and putting her at number eight on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons was back in the 400IH where she was the top seed. Running an excellent race, but finishing with far too much left, Simmons won, running a personal best of 63.29.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones and Gross were back on the track in the 200. Jones had a fine start and despite the quality field, she pulled away with ease, running a personal best and new MIT record of 24.70. This time moves her to number four on the NCAA list. Gross also ran a personal best, placing eighth in 25.77.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x800, Alicia Kaestli '12, who had run the 800 in a personal best 2:20.76 earlier in the 800, led off with a 2:23.7. Lloyd doubled back from the steeplechase, but was by herself and only produced a 2:26.4 split. Emily Kuo '13, was a little too excited and went out in 68.1, which moved the team into first place in the unseeded section, but not for long. Kuo suffered for her fast first lap, running 2:30.5. Wentz, just running fast enough to win, nevertheless needed a 2:16.5 to get the job done. The overall time of 9:37.47 gave MIT fifth overall in the event. 
    
    
                  
    
    Briner finished the pentathlon in style, running a well paced 2:23.14 in the 800, scored 4262 points, an MIT record and provisional qualifying mark for the NCAA Championship. Briner was up in the pole vault, having cleared 10-8, when she needed to go run a leg in the 4x400. Gross led things off with a 58.2, followed by Simmons, also running 58.2. Briner, who it turned out was fighting a cold, was only able to produce a 62.3. Jones anchored, regaining the lead and winning with a 57.1 split to win the event in 3:56.06. 
    
    
                  
    
    The final event, the pole vault went well for MIT although none of the women set any personal bests. Briner was unable to clear another height, but tied for sixth place. Lauren Kuntz '13, also cleared 10-8, earning fifth place on fewer misses. Karin Fisher '11, jumped well, clearing 11-7 3/4 to place second.
    
    
                  
    
    Both teams wanted to win, but the superb performances, the team spirit that was inspirational throughout the meet and the amazing competitiveness of both teams earned everyone's respect, despite the second place finishes.
    
    
                  
    
    Now MIT will start to focus on getting people positioned for the NCAA Championships in four weeks. The next week is the NEICAAA Championship which pits all of the colleges from all divisions against each other. The Friday-Saturday competition will be held on Northeastern's Dedham campus. MIT will not be trying to score the most points possible, only attempting to rest people and compete people in events to qualify for the NCAAs.

    Great Performances Abound as MIT Prepares for NCAA Championships 
    
    
                  
    
    May 8-9 , 2010
    
    
                  
    
    Day one of the two day New England Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association (NEICAAA) had the great weather, with near 80 degree temperatures and bright sunshine, and day two had the rain and much cooler temperatures. However, both days provided great competition from teams from all divisions throughout New England.
    
    
                  
    
    Despite neither MIT team running their distance runners and Stephen Morton '10, taking the weekend off to prepare for the NCAA Championships in three weeks, both teams placed very well. The men finished sixth overall and the top Division III team with 36 points. The women placed eighth with 37 points, just 3.75 points behind Williams College, the only Division III team ahead of them. 
    
    
                  
    
    On day one, personal bests came from three individuals. Jamie Simmons '12, in the 400IH ran 62.90 despite decelerating on the first five hurdles due to her steps being off. Lauren Kuntz '13, cleared a new personal best of 10-11 3/4 in the pole vault. Brian Djaja '13, made amends for his DNF last weekend by running a PR of 15.21 in the high hurdles. Along with Simmons qualifying for the finals on Saturday, Portia Jones '12, qualified in the 400 by winning her section in 57.42 and had the fastest qualifying time in the 200, running 24.73, just .03 off her personal best. 
    
    
                  
    
    Scorers on Friday were led by Vlad Sobes '11, who threw 197-8 in the javelin to place fourth. In the women's pole vault, Karin Fisher '11, earned fifth place by clearing 11-5 3/4. Fisher was over 11-9 3/4 on her first attempt, but failed to push her pole away properly, thus allowing the pole to displace the crossbar. Kuntz placed eighth with her personal best.
    
    
                  
    
    Saturday, the day began with a 30 minutes lightning delay. That delay did nothing to derail the day MIT was about to have. Maggie Lloyd '12, got things started with a very well paced and strategically raced 3000 Steeplechase. Racing in the unseeded section, Lloyd continued to knock significant seconds off of her personal best, putting together splits ranging from 88 to 92 seconds to finish second in her section with a 11:19.26, thirty five seconds faster than her best last year.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's 4x100 relay was next for MIT. The quartet of Margaret Leibovic '10, Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12 and Portia Jones '12, needed about .3 seconds faster in order to secure a spot among the 4x100 teams going to the NCAA Division III Championship. However, due to the rain delay, they were not able to get out and check their marks in their respective zones. This was their downfall as each of the three handoffs lost significant time. Nevertheless, showing they were at least ready to run fast, the foursome ran 48.65, matching their second best performance ever. There are still two more opportunities to lower their time.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500, Yermie Cohen '10, and Jacqui Wentz '10 were making the effort to lower their NCAA qualifying times. Cohen was up first, being fortunate enough to just make it into the fastest section with his 3:51.92 from the week before. Having a sub four minute miler in the field helped as the pace went out fast for the top two runners. The chase group, which Cohen was a part of, was pretty quick as well, going through early splits of 61.4 and 2:02.7. The pace slowed a bit on the third quarter, coming through in 3:05.3. Cohen took the lead on the last lap, running 43 seconds for the final 300, obviously still having something left at the finish. His third place, 3:48.40, is not only an automatic qualifying NCAA Championship performance, but also leads the nation in Division III and is a new MIT record. Wentz was in the second of three sections, just missing the fastest section. Nevertheless, the pace was quick enough to get her the overall time she was looking for, with the first 400 being 72.7, the 800 2:26.5 and the 1200 in 3:39.8. Wentz had the lead in the third quarter, but did not put the competition away. She lost the lead in the final 300, and lacked her usual fight. Nevertheless, she finished in 4:33.00, a much improved time, but probably not fast enough to get into the national field.
    
    
                  
    
    Portia Jones was back on the track, representing MIT in the 400. She ran the first 200 a lot more conservatively than usual, putting herself in a great position to race the final 200. Jones pulled into the lead on the home stretch, winning in 56.79, her fastest outdoor performance for the season.
    
    
                  
    
    The 800 was next for MIT, and Pat Marx '13, was out to try to qualify for nationals. Not making the fast section meant he would have to push the final 400 the entire way and not be satisfied with just winning his section. The first lap was a solid 55 seconds, but Marx was taking a long time to move up. Finally making a move with 200 to go, Marx began to move up, however it was too little, too late as he was unable to win his section, which went in 1:52.69, which earned second overall. Marx was back at 1:53.62, good for third in his section and sixth overall.
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons ran a much cleaner race in the 400IH final, but still decelerated for four of the hurdles and came off one of the hurdles off balance, while still finishing with too much left. All of this indicates she has a lot more left before running the perfect race. Her third place 62.39 was an excellent personal best and moved her up to number two on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Jones was back on the track in the 200, an event where she was ranked sixth in the country. Jones had a nice start, but with a slight headwind was unable to better her time. She did secure a third place, matching her personal best time of 24.70
    
    
                  
    
    The seeded sections of the 3000 Steeplechase were next with Paul Welle also out to move up on the NCAA list. The pace was solid, with the leaders running 4:56 for the 1600. After one more 75 second lap, the pace picked up to 73 seconds and Welle took the lead. However, his failure to negotiate clean water jump attempts gave the eventual winner enough of a gap that Welle could not overcome, but still good enough for second place. Nevertheless, Welle moved up to number seven on the NCAA list and number three on the MIT all-time list with a 9:12.22. 
    
    
                  
    
    The only remaining running event for MIT was the 4x400. The women had only run 3:54 this season and knew they needed to get serious about running fast. Running in the seeded section put them with the best competition and the foursome took advantage of it. Running in lane one, Simmons was able to see the entire field in front of her, but the three turn stagger made it seem like an insurmountable distance. This did nothing but motivate Simmons as she walked down the field with an excellent 56.7 leadoff leg. A very good handoff to Gross, and an excellent leg of 57.1, put MIT in second place, about ten meters back of first. Kirsten Aarsvold '11, running on the 4x400 for the first time this season, lost ground despite a personal best 60.0 split, finishing in third, approximately 30 meters in back of UNH and another 10 meters behind UMass Lowell. Jones got the baton after Aarsvold failed to place it in her hand the first time and proceeded to make up ground on the leaders. Running 25.8 for the first 200 and blowing past the UNH runner with 120 to go, Jones was now 10 meters back of the leader. She closed another five meters, but could not close the distance, finishing .82 back, running an incredible 54.4 even though she did not sprint through the finish line. The cumulative time of 3:48.62 was an automatic NCAA qualifying mark, destroying the MIT record by three seconds.
    
    
                  
    
    In the men's pole vault, Greg Tao '10, placed second on misses with a jump of 15-2 3/4. Cyrus Vafadari '12, cleared 14-2 3/4 to place fifth and Nathan Peterson '12, finished seventh, clearing the same height.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT will continue to try to move individuals up on the NCAA Division III list. Most of those continuing will compete in the ECAC Division III Championship at Springfield College on Thursday and Friday. Stephen Morton and possibly one other will make the trip to the IC4A Championship hosted by Princeton University.

    MIT MEN AND WOMEN REPEAT AS NEWMAC CONFERENCE CHAMPIONS 
    
    
                  
    
    April 24, 2010
    
    
                  
    
    Both the men's and women's track and field teams were expected to repeat as NEWMAC Champions and neither team disappointed. The men won their 10th in succession and 11th of the 12 championships in conference history. MIT scored 249 points to 182.5 for runner-up Springfield College. The women won their second in a row and third in four years, racking up 197.5 points to 167 for host Springfield College.
    
    
                  
    
    Neither MIT team had superb meets, which can sometimes happen when the team is heavily favored to win and not "pumped up" for the meet. Both teams were also probably thinking more about the New England Division III Championship, which is next weekend. Nevertheless, the men set 14 personal bests, had two new NCAA Division III provisional qualifying marks and claimed eight individual victories. The women set two MIT records, 15 season or personal bests and two NCAA Division III provisional qualifying marks. 
    
    
                  
    
    MIT men's team took a couple hits before the meet ever started. Rene Peters '13, and Pat Marx '13, both expected to score quite a few points, took the weekend off from competing in hopes their nagging injuries will be completely healed by next weekend. After a slow start which had the coaches wondering why the victories were not happening with the frequency and in the events MIT is accustomed to dominating, they did eventually start rolling in.
    
    
                  
    
    The Tech men lost a key battle to WPI in the hammer throw, only securing fourth and fifth place while WPI claimed 1-2-3. This seemed to be the way things were going to go when the 10K also went to WPI, leaving MIT with only third, fifth and sixth--unheard of in the 10K for MIT. If this was not bad enough, despite Richard Prevost '11, running a personal best and NCAA qualifying time of 9:22.05, he was out kicked in 9:21.82. Favored winner, Paul Welle '11, finished third, new steepler, Stephen Serene '12, showed this is his event as he claimed fifth in 9:45.11 and Dawit Zewdie '13, took seventh in a personal best 9:59.60 to take some of the sting out of losing another first place.
    
    
                  
    
    Finally things began to click, when Yermie Cohen '10, led a quartet of MIT runners to a 1-3-4-7 finish in the 1500. Cohen waited until there was 400 meter to go before he sprinted away, finishing his final 300 in 42 seconds. Hemu Arumugam '10, and Ben Mattocks '12, ran personal bests in 4:02.53 and 4:02.85 respectively to take third and fourth. The men's javelin throw was going on at the same time and Vlad Sobes '11, dominated the event, throwing a five meter best and earning a national qualifying position with his 200-11 throw.
    
    
                  
    
    The 110HH did not go so well as Brian Djaja '13, seeded third, hit the sixth hurdle, stumbled into the seventh hurdle, pushing it down and getting disqualified. Nick Leonard '11, got a poor start as did Josh Duncavage '13. Only Andrew Musacchio '11, delivered for MIT, claiming third in the final. Fortunately, the shot putters fought off a poor start and claimed a 1-2-3-6 finish led by James Oleinik's victory with a throw of 47-00.25.
    
    
                  
    
    Stephen Morton '10, won both the long jump and triple jump, taking a minimum of jumps, but did not bring much speed to the track. Even though he set a season best in the 100 trials with his 10.95, he was only able to claim fifth in the 100 and fourth in the 200.
    
    
                  
    
    Cohen returned in the 800, running an evenly split race, hitting 58 on both the first and last laps to win in 1:56.29. Logan Daum '11, missed is personal best by .01 as he raced brilliantly to place third in 1:58.35.
    
    
                  
    
    Mitch Kelley, took care of first place with a new personal best in the discus of 151-7. His teammates did not bring it in this event, but MIT still added a fifth and sixth. The final field event, the pole vault, an expected win, did not quite finish that way, but MIT did the next best thing, claiming 2-3-4-5 with Cyrus Vafadari '12, setting a personal best and Davey Hunt '12 setting a season best of 14-9 and 14-2.75 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    In the remaining track events, Duncavage '13, ran a fine personal best in the 400IH to claim third in 56.43 as Leonard continued to struggle, running 57.61 for fourth. Dan Harper '12, the lone MIT runner in the 5000 after the team pulled Arumugam and Mattocks due to the teams insurmountable lead, won going away in a personal best of 15:20.65, running the final mile in 4:51 before closing the final 200 in 33.
    
    
                  
    
    The women only claimed six individual victories but their balance kept the other teams at bay, allowing them to pull three of their top seeded 5K runners and two of their 4x400 runners to save a little for the remaining championships.
    
    
                  
    
    Alina Gatowski '11, and Sarah Sprague '13, got things started in the 10K. Both ran as slow as necessary to get the job done on the warm and windy day. Gatowski finally tired of the pedestrian pace, opening up a lead after four miles to win easily. Sprague claimed third to give MIT an easy 16 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The 4x100, consisting of Margaret Leibovic '10, Martha Gross '12, Jamie Simmons '12, and Portia Jones '12, claimed second with a new MIT record and an NCAA Division III provisional qualifying time of 48.65.
    
    
                  
    
    The track events continued to go well as Maggie Lloyd '12, knocked nine seconds off her best to claim second in the 3000 steeplechase with a time of 11:40.40. Jacqui Wentz '10, Brooke Johnson '13, Alicia Kaestli '12 and Tania Morimoto '12, took care of the 1500, running 4:37.77, 4:47.34, 4:54.97 and 4:57.53 respectively to take 1-3-4-5. Wentz's time provisionally qualified her for the NCAA Division III Championship. 
    
    
                  
    
    However, in the field events things were not clicking as well. The javelin throw provided no points and the long jump only gave MIT a sixth place. MIT's signature event, the pole vault only provided a third, fourth and fifth. The high jump only produced a 2-5-8 finish as Jones claimed second on a 5-1 height clearance. The remaining throwing events only gave MIT four points. 
    
    
                  
    
    Fortunately, the track events continued to go well. Jones won the 100HH pretty easily in 14.73 and set a new MIT record when she sprinted to a 11.50 in the 100 meter dash trials. Her 11.52 gave her a third place in the final. Hazel Briner '11, ran a season best of 15.67 in the 100HH to support Jones's effort  with a fourth place and Leibovic earned a sixth in the 100.
    
    
                  
    
    Simmons and Gross took care of business in the 400, taking first and second with personal bests of 57.49 and 58.55. Wentz returned in the 800 and led it from start to finish in an even split 2:17.81. Wentz had to run out of the slow section since she had not run an 800 as yet in the outdoor season. Simmons returned in the 400IH and won easily in 63.85. Jones ran her sixth race of the day to place second to Simmons with a 65.46. Kirsten Aarsvold '11, added a fifth place for the cause. Gross returned in the 200 to place fourth in the 200 and Leibovic and Briner added a seventh and eighth.
    
    
                  
    
    After pulling the three top 5K runners, Lauren Allen '13, did her job, placing second in a personal best of 18:56.55, missing the New England Division III qualifying mark by .07 seconds.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event, the 4x400, Emily Kuo (64.4), Gross (59.0), Aarsvold (61.8) and Simmons (57.1) placed second in 4:02.52.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, the Engineers will need a lot more enthusiasm and much better performances if they are to stand a chance of taking the New England Division III Championship from favored Williams College. MIT's women won last years title despite being 50 point underdogs and the men won this years indoor New England title.

    FIVE NCAA QUALIFIERS LEAD THE WAY FOR WOMEN'S TRACK AND FIELD 
    
    
                  
    
    April 17, 2010
    
    
                  
    
    Despite a relatively warm April, the weather for MIT's annual Spring Invitational was far from pleasant. Nevertheless, MIT showed just how ready they are for the championships as they produced five NCAA qualifying marks and a school record in the 45 degree temperatures and light rain. 
    
    
                  
    
    Other than the performances, the highlight of the meet was a visit from World Record Holder in the mile, Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco. In town for a road race on Sunday, El Guerrouj requested to meet and speak with the MIT track team. 
    
    
                  
    
    Holding nearly a third of their athletes out to rest up for upcoming championships, the ones who competed performed very well. Alina Gatowski '11, set her second MIT record of the season, taking the 5000 in an NCAA provisional qualifying time of 17:22.81. Gatowski took advantage of the low temperatures and lack of wind, taking the lead at the gun, running 1600 splits of 5:29, 5:38, 5:37 and finishing with a 38 final 200, showing there was more there.
    
    
                  
    
    Earlier in the meet, Portia Jones '12, ran her first 400 of the season. Even though there was little competition, Jones toured the oval in 57.19 to provisionally qualify for the NCAA Championship in May. Jones also claimed the 200 in 25.75.
    
    
                  
    
    Jamie Simmons '12, returned to the 400IH, this time running a personal best of 63.33 to post the fourth fastest time in the country for Division III.
    
    
                  
    
    Jacqui Wentz '10, is wasting no time getting back to her All America shape of last year despite her two month lay off from her stress reaction. She was the only entrant in the 3000 Steeplechase but ran a solid NCAA qualifying performance of 10:50.06, the third fastest time in the country thus far.
    
    
                  
    
    Karin Fisher '11, matched her personal outdoor best in the pole vault with a 11-8 1/2 victory. Fisher had outstanding attempts at 12-2, but was not able to clear the height on this particular day.
    
    
                  
    
    While not qualifying for nationals, Brooke Johnson returned to competition in her first outdoor race, running 4:48.76 in the 1500. Johnson should improve quickly over the next few weeks if she can run 4:48 after only one week of running. Maggie Lloyd '12, made her 1500 debut, running 4:57.22.
    
    
                  
    
    On the men's side, the highlight event was the 800. Pat Marx '13, took advantage of a relatively quick pace of 55 for the first 400 and won easily in 1:53.94. Marx had more but did not push the third 200 sufficiently. Yermie Cohen '10, ran a fine time of 1:55.08 for his personal best. Other MIT runners doing well in the 800 were Dawit Zewdie '13, running 1:57.44, Bill Phipps '10, running 1:58.09 and Logan Daum '11, breaking 2:00 for the first time with a 1:58.34.
    
    
                  
    
    James Oleinik 'G, threw his season best of 50-3 1/4 in the shot put to win by nearly five feet. Also in the throws, Mitch Kelley '11, threw a personal best of 151-2 to win the discus.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 3000 Steeplechase, Stephen Serene '12, made his debut with an excellent negative split 10:01.97 for the victory.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, the men and women attempt to defend their NEWMAC conference titles at Springfield College on Saturday, starting at 11:00.

    MIT OPENS WITH EIGHT NCAA PROVISIONAL QUALIFYING MARKS 
    
    
                  
    
    October 27, 2010 
    
    
                  
    
    MIT traveled to Washington & Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, to compete in a multi-team invitational this past weekend. The intent was to seek out some warmer weather during the spring break week. With the exception of some wind and rain to start the day on Friday the weather could not have been much better. At the end of the two day affair MIT had accumulated eight NCAA Division III provisional qualifying performances.
    
    
                  
    
    Day 1, the first day of the heptathlon, saw Hazel Briner '11, take a substantial lead with marks of 16.51 in the 100HH, 4-11 in the high jump, 35-8 in the shot put and 27.82 in the 200. Greg Tao '10, won the pole vault with an NCAA qualifying performance of 15-11. Later in the day (nine hours later) Briner and Karin Fisher '11, tied for second in the vault with a clearance of 10-11 3/4. In other first day field events Vlad Sobes '11, won the javelin throw despite the muddy approach on the grass runway, with a throw of 186-5. Stephen Morton '10, won the triple jump with a leap of 46-4, but only took three attempts in an effort to save his legs for later in the season. Tony McDonald '10, led the MIT throwers in the discus with a toss of 140-1 for third place. 
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, the women's 4x400 team of Jamie Simmons '12, Martha Gross '12, Briner and Portia Jones '12, led the way to victory with a national qualifying performance of 3:54.28, thanks to a 55.8 anchor by Jones. The men ran a fine early season time of 3:24.94 as Pat Marx '13, anchored a team of Nick Leonard '11, DJ Ronde '13, and Josh Duncavage '13, with a 48.9 split. Stephen Serene '12, ran a personal best in the 1500 with a time of 4:03.38. In the 3000 steeplechase, Paul Welle '11 and Richard Prevost '11, had an excellent start to the season. Going out in an ambitious first mile of 4:57, Welle kept pace running a provisional qualifying time of 9:24.11. Prevost fell off a bit, but still ran a fine fourth place time of 9:34.71. In the 5K, Ben Mattocks '12, ran a very even paced race, running a personal best of 15:36.52 to win his section. The 10K was run as a combined men's and women's race, the only event the NCAA will permit to be conducted in such a manner. On the men's side, MIT ran very well. Hemu Arumugam '10, negatively split the race, which started with a pedestrian 81 second first 400. His mile splits were 5:14, 5:07, 5:11, 5:08, 5:02 and 5:05 before finishing the race in 32:02.11. Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, stayed on pace with Arumugam until 4.5 miles, finishing in 32:10.90. Dan Harper '12, also raced well, placing eighth in 32:31.63. The women put the exclamation point on a very good first day of competition. Alina Gatowski '11, led start to finish in a national qualifying time and MIT record of 36:11.12. Tania Morimoto '12, who shared pace setting duties with Gatowski through 4.5 miles, also ran a provisional qualifying time, placing third in 37:01.55. Freshman, Sarah Sprague ran an excellent 39:12.60 10K debut. Gatowski ran 18:28 for the first 5K and 17:43 for the final 5K. Her final mile was 5:34 and looked as though she had just begun to run.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two was sunny with temperatures between the upper 40s to lower 50s and a bit of wind. Briner closed out the heptathlon with a score of 4079, just short of NCAA qualifying, earning the victory with marks of 15-6 in the long jump, 78-6 in the javelin (muddy approach) and 2:27.42 in the 800.
    
    
                  
    
    Also for the women, the 4x100 unit of Margaret Leibovic '10, Gross, Simmons and Jones ran an impressive early season mark of 49.68 despite two pretty bad handoffs. Jones claimed a victory with a national qualifying performance and personal best of 14.56 in the 100HH. Maggie Lloyd ran two personal bests, 11:49.98 in the steeplechase on Friday and then 2:25.17 to win her section and place sixth overall in the 800. Gross ran an excellent 26.33 in the 200 after running an outdoor personal best of 58.98 in the 400. Simmons won the 400IH in 63.62 to provisionally qualify for nationals. Marie Burkland '13, raced to a 4:56.27 1500 to win her section and move into MIT's top 10 list.
    
    
                  
    
    Stephen Morton led the way on day two for the men. In the long jump, he again only took three jumps, improving on each one as he finished in second place with a national qualifying mark of 23-4 3/4. In the 200, he won with an excellent time of 22.15. In the 100 he raced to a 10.98 to place second. He also anchored the 4x100 to a very fast time of 42.82 despite poor handoffs. Rene Peters '13, opened up, handing off to Josh Duncavage '13, who handed off to third leg, Nick Leonard '11. Peters also placed sixth in the 100 with an 11.16 clocking. In the 800, Pat Marx '13, ran an excellent race, winning it with a personal best of 1:55.38. Also running quality opening times were Dawit Zewdie '13, and Serene, finishing in 1:57.58 and 1:57.66 respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    Also in the field events, James Oleinik 'G, placed third in the shot put with a put of 48-3 1/2. In the hammer, MIT had three men in the finals. CK Umachi '12, led the way in fifth with a personal best of 162-10. Tony McDonald '10, threw 151-7 for seventh and Ken Cooper '13, threw 149-11 for eighth place. Matt Falk jumped to a personal best in winning the high jump with a leap of 6-2 3/4.
    
    
                  
    
    On a side note, Yermie Cohen '10, completing his final outdoor season, competed in the 1500 in the Stanford Invitational, running 3:52.82 to qualify for nationals. 
    
    
                  
    
    Overall, MIT had an excellent first meet. Next Saturday, at 1:00, Tech travels to RPI in Troy, NY to compete in the Engineer's Cup against RPI and WPI.
