    May 16-17, 2008
    
    
      
    
    MIT traveled west to Springfield College, host of the ECAC Division III Championship, to try to improve qualifying marks for the NCAA Division III Championhips the following week, or in some cases, try to make those qualifying marks. While over 20 MIT athletes qualified for this championship, only six made this trip, mostly because the team philosophy is to only continue those with a shot at making nationals but partly because the MIT students are getting ready for finals and are pretty fatigued from the previous three championships. Those six athletes performed well enough to give MIT a 10th place finish among the 52 scoring teams with 26 points.
    
    
      
    
    Leading the way for Tech was once again the pole vault. Greg Tao back competing again, won with a near personal best of 15-5. Not vaulting his best, Omari Stephens still supported the Engineers quite will with his third place 14-11 effort. Patrick Barragan added a seventh place at 14-5 1/4. 
    
    
      
    
    In the shot put, James Oleinik continued to throw well. Oleinik claimed fourth place, throwing 49-5 1/2. The only other two athletes competing for MIT were Stephen Morton and Anthony Teixeira in the long and triple jumps. Morton had already qualified for nationals in the long jump but wanted to add the triple jump to his event list. Jumping into a light wind, Morton managed a sixth place with a lump of 22-1 3/4. Teixeira leaped to a very respectable 21-9 but did not make finals. In the triple jump, Morton only managed 44-5 1/2 in the trials before shutting it down under the pouring rain conditions. Teixeira could not find it this day, only jumping 43-5 3/4.
    
    
      
    
    Down at Princeton University, representing MIT at the IC4A Championship, Joe Roy-Mayhew raced his way to a personal best in the 10K, running 31:30.12
    
    
      
    
    Next week, Morton, Stephens and Tao will all represent MIT at the NCAA Championships at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh.

    **MIT Engineers Victory Over RPI and WPI**
    
    
      
    
    April 5, 2008
    
    
      
    
    The first meet of the season back in New England was a little warmer and a lot drier than expected and MIT took advantage by carving out a victory against RPI and WPI in the annual Engineer's Cup hosted by MIT with a score of 191 to 101 for RPI and 95 for WPI. MIT won 11 of the 19 events with Omari Stephens winning both the pole vault and the 110HH, Stephen Morton winning the 100 and 200 and Anthony Teixeira winning the long jump and triple jump for MIT's double event winners. The scoring went 7-5-4-3-2-1 for individual events and 7-5-0 for the relays. 
    
    
      
    
    Stephens won the vault with a season and outdoor best of 15-9. He was supported well as Greg Tao cleared a PR of 15-0 1/4 for second place and Patrick Barragan jumped a personal best of 14-3 1/4 for fourth place. In the high hurdles, Stephens pulled out the hard fought victory on the final hurdle in 15.30. Teixeira helped out by running 15.59 for fourth and Dave Fernholz placed sixth with a personal best of 16.13. 
    
    
      
    
    Teixeira only jumped in the trials of the long jump but that was enough for the win with a jump of 21-3 1/4. Without Stephen Morton in the event, Mattias Flander, Eric Beecher and Oliver Yeh took up the slack, placing third, fourth and fifth respectively. In the triple jump, "Tex" jumped 44-5 1/2 to win on his lasp attempt. Morton and Flander supported Teixeira'a victory with a second and third place. Obinna Anyanwu followed with a fifth place performance.
    
    
      
    
    Morton sprinted to a 10.92 100 meter dash victory and was supported by Flander in fourth place. In the 200, Morton and Teixeira placed 1-2 with Morton running away with the victory in 22.26. Morton and Teixeira also teamed up with Nick Leonard and Anyanwu to win the 4x100 relay in a season best of 43.24. Overall, the sprint times were quite good given the 45 degree temperature.
    
    
      
    
    Other MIT victories were led by a New England Division III leading performance by James Oleinik with a toss of 48-10 1/4. Kevin Kleinguetl took a small departure from his 800 and won the 400 with a time of 52.15. Dave Reshef was close behind in second place with a 52.34 performance. Richard Prevost knocked 20 seconds off of his debut in the 3000 Steeplechase with a 9:56.06 victory. Prevost was supported by Rocco Repetski in second place with a fine 10:14.85. The final MIT victory was in the 4x400 relay. Matt Bieniosek followed up his 1:57.71 second place in the 800 with a 52.1 leadoff leg. Reshef doubled back from his 400 with a 51.6 leg, handing off to Leonard who ran 53.8 to allow RPI to get very close. Kleinguetl prove equal to the task of anchoring as he ran a 51.5 for the victory.
    
    
      
    
    One of the top efforts of the day went to Tony McDonald. The sophomore thrower threw a 153-6 personal best for third place in the hammer, a 43-3 1/4 personal best in the shot put for another third and 126-7 for third place in the discus.
    
    
      
    
    One other performance of note was a personal best of 171-1 in the javelin by freshman Vlad Sobes. Sobes was leading until the final round.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT travels north to Colby College in Waterville, Maine to compete against Bates, Colby and Southern Maine.

    May 22-24, 2008
    
    
      
    
    Omari Stephens finished his MIT career by earning All America honors at the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championship hosted by the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. Clearing 14-11 in the pole vault, Stephens tied for eighth place, earning half a point for MIT. Greg Tao also competed in the pole vault and the sophomore also cleared 14-11, but finished 10th due to misses.
    
    
      
    
    Stephen Morton, another sophomore, competed in the long jump. After placing eighth indoors in the long jump at these championships, Morton's hopes were high to improve on that mark. Jumping 22-3, Morton missed finals my one place, finishing in 10th place.
    
    
      
    
    With two sophomores gaining such valuable experience the future looks very nice for the next two years.

    **MIT SECURES SECOND PLACE IN NEW ENGLAND DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    May 2-3, 2008
    
    
      
    
    The MIT Engineers were seeded second going into the New England Division III Championship and they did not disappoint, securing three event victories en route to scoring 92 points, just holding off the host Coast Guard Academy with 87 points for second place out of the 26 scoring teams. 
    
    
      
    
    Despite the temperatures in the low 50s and the cloudy, windy conditions, Tech was not deterred from performing their best marks of the season in many events. Beginning the meet on Friday, MIT was already 21 points down to Coast Guard due to the hosts placing 1-3-4 in the decathlon. MIT tried to answer in the 10K by taking the pace out and making an honest race out of it. Tech had five qualifiers in the 31 man field and hoped to drop most of them in the first mile with the 5:03 opening mile, but very few dropped back. With the second mile split of 10:11 there were still 12 runners in the lead pack. When the Joe Roy-Mayhew, Chris Wong and Brian Jacokes led the way through three miles in 15:20, ten were still in the pack. Jack Bourbonnais and Trevor Rundell had faded to the rear of the lead pack but were trying to stay in contact. Roy-Mayhew continued to push the pace through four with another 5:06. Rundell faded to a 5:22 and Bourbonnais a 5:10. Jacokes faded to the back of the pack in eighth place while Wong stayed right behind Roy-Mayhew. Things continued that way in the fifth mile with another 5:06 but then the pace really picked up. Roy-Mayhew covered the sixth mile in 4:55 and 68 in the final 400 and fell eight seconds off the leader but finished within one second of second for fourth place in a new personal best of 31:35.61. Chris Wong and Brian Jacokes also scored in seventh and eighth place with personal best times of 31:54.31 and 32:10.97 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    While MIT did not place as high as they had hoped for in the 10K, the long jump went better than expected. Stephen Morton, leading the long jump through the trials with teammate Anthony Teixeira in second place. In the fifth round, Carl Luxhoj from Coast Guard took the lead with a 22-8 effort. In typical Stephen Morton style, the sophomore flew down the runway and popped a 23-8 personal record to seal the victory. MIT's 16 points were a big boost for a total of 24 for the night.
    
    
      
    
    Day two began well for MIT as James Oleinik took the shot with a personal best of 49-8 1/2 for MIT's second victory. On the javelin runway, Vlad Sobes proved his 189-4 throw the week before was no fluke by throwing a 186-7 on his second attempt to take the lead, which he held until the final two rounds where he fell to fourth, which was his seed.
    
    
      
    
    On the track, freshmen Paul Welle and Richard Prevost were seeded third and fourth in the 3000 Steeplechase. The leaders, who were the top two seeds from Williams College, had other ideas as the pace roared through a first mile in 5:01. Prevost started to fall off the pace but Welle held though he slowed to 78 second 400s. Welle's final kick even though he tumbled out of the water pit netted him a 9:29.39 personal best for third place and ninth on the MIT all-time list. Prevost showed a lot of pride and determination holding on to seventh place in 9:38.22.
    
    
      
    
    In the 400 Relay, MIT got the baton around really well to the second handoff where Mattias Flander just could not hang with the other third legs. A good handoff to Morton gave MIT hope but his hamstring started bothering him, preventing him from hitting maximum speed. Nevertheless MIT finished sixth, one place higher than they were seeded.
    
    
      
    
    Jake Ruzevick raced very well in the 1500, holding onto seventh place in 4:00.62 despite an early pace taking the field through 800 meters in 2:06. In the next event, Teixeira added a fourth place in the 110HH in 15.44 although he had run a personal best in the trials in a time of 15.10. Teixeira was in second through seven hurdles but he hit hands with another hurdler on the eighth hurdle, which through him off the final two hurdles. Omari Stephens clipped a few hurdles but secured sixth place in 15.77. This finish was a slight gain in points as MIT was seeded fifth and sixth.
    
    
      
    
    Stephens went back to the pole vault where he recovered to clear on his third attempt at his opening height en route to a second place of 15-1. Teammate Greg Tao won for the second week in succession, jumping 15-5. Patrick Barragan once again added support with a fifth place finish and a successful vault of 14-3 1/4. 
    
    
      
    
    At this point, Coast Guard, never very far behind, started to close the gap. MIT was not seeded to score in the 400, 400IH or 800 and with Morton hurting, he was pulled out of the 200. The only scoring events left for MIT were the triple jump, the 5000 and the 4x400. In the triple jump Morton jumped in the trials but with his hamstring hurting he was only able to just make finals with the eighth best jump. Flander jumped very well and managed a fourth place with a 45-3 3/4. Teixeira, having his own hurting hamstrings, was unable to score as he finished just behind Morton in ninth. Luxhoj from Coast Guard again jumped well, finishing in second and closing the gap between MIT and Coast Guard to nine points and Coast Guard had a very good chance of winning the 4x400.
    
    
      
    
    Roy-Mayhew had volunteered earlier in the week to be put in the 10K and the 5K, a maniacal request in most meets and with both fields showing such high quality it was suicidal. With Coast Guard closing the gap his volunteer services were indeed needed. With the relative inexperience of Hemagiri Arumugam and Gihan Amarasiriwardena representing MIT in the 5000, Roy-Mayhew's presence was welcomed by the MIT coaching staff. In a very fast race, Roy-Mayhew held on through mile splits of 4:50, 4:56 and 4:52 and managed to finish the final 200 in 34 seconds to place 6th in 15:12.95. This secured second place for MIT as it gave MIT a 12 point lead going into the final event.
    
    
      
    
    In the 4x400, Coast Guard placed second in 3:22.53 and MIT placed eighth in 3:27.02 as everyone was cold and tired after sitting in the poor weather conditions for eight hours. Williams College won the meet as expected with 151 points.
    
    
      
    
    This meet wraps up the season for most of MIT's Engineers. A few who still have a shot at placing in the All New England Championship and or qualifying for nationals may continue for the remainder of the season. The NEICAAA Championship, the All New Englands, will be held at the University of New Hampshire on Friday and Saturday, May 9-10.

    **Teixeira and Oleinik Set Career Bests at All New England Meet**
    
    
      
    
    May 9-10, 2008
    
    
      
    
    Due to the end of the semester, which brings the due date for final projects, senior thesis and the approach of final exams, many All New England qualifiers from MIT ended their season with the New England Division III Championships. Once the individual championships begin only a few who have a shot at nationals and or those still improving continue in these last couple of weeks. The few that made this trip made the most of it, scoring 12 points in a tie for 20th place among the 37 scoring teams and many that did not score.
    
    
      
    
    Leading the way for Tech was Omari Stephens in the pole vault. Stephens had a lot of trouble on the approach but persevered, managing to clear 15-9 and earn second place and tie his outdoor best. Greg Tao was not able to make the trip and Patrick Barragan had difficulty with the 14-3 opening height.
    
    
      
    
    James Oleinik, who has been having an outstanding spring, added a foot to his personal best when he put the shot 50-10 to earn sixth place. Oleinik's first throw, a debatable foul, was even further.
    
    
      
    
    In the long jump, Anthony Teixeira leaped to a personal best 22-5 for eighth place. Teixeira also had a minimum foul that was right around the 23-0 mark. In the triple jump, Teixeira could not find the magic in the legs and was unable to make finals. Stephen Morton, only triple jumping in this meet, could not find the technique that gave him the indoor school record at 47-11, managing only a 44-11 1/2.
    
    
      
    
    In the javelin, Vlad Sobes threw 177-2 but just missed finals. Teixeira also competed in the 110HH but did not have his best day, running 15.46. 
    
    
      
    
    Next Thursday and Friday, MIT travels west to Springfield College to compete in the ECAC Division III Championship. Again, only a handful of MIT athletes will compete, attempting to get that NCAA qualifying mark.

    **ENGINEERS CONSTRUCT ANOTHER CONFERENCE VICTORY**
    
    
      
    
    **MIT's Eighth Consecutive Title**
    
    
      
    
    April 26, 2008
    
    
      
    
    MIT had won seven consecutive NEWMAC titles in a row and eight of the nine since the conference's inception in 1999. For the second year in succession, the meet was a toss-up based on the seeds. Last year, Springfield College presented the challenge, this year the culprit was a very talented team from the Coast Guard Academy, a program that has been building steadily over the years and were ready to take command of the conference. Based on the seeds the meet was dead even--determination and some good fortune would make the difference. 
    
    
      
    
    On a day when the wind swirled and was usually at the face of the sprinters and jumpers and the sun would come out to expose 65 degree temperatures and then go behind the clouds as the temperatures dropped to mid 50s, MIT started slowly, built to a series of solid performances and finished with a flurry of points to open up a commanding lead en route to their eighth consecutive championship with 240 points to 188.5 for  Coast Guard, 146 for Springfield, 119.5 for WPI, 71 for Wheaton and 3 for Babson.
    
    
      
    
    The first event, the 10K, an event MIT usually dominates did not go as expected. A Coast Guard runner took the pace out hard with a 75 second opening 400, disrupting MIT's strategy and forcing Tech's runners to abandon their plan and for a chase group. This amended plan worked for Jack Bourbonnais, who won with a 32:53.30 on the windy day, but Trevor Rundell and Gihan Amarasiriwardena could not maintain the pace. Rundell ran 33:16.78 for fifth and Amarasiriwardena faded to seventh with a 33:43.70. In 2007, MIT's times would have garnered 1-2-3. Coast Guard placed second and fourth to garner 13 points, starting the meet three points in arrears.
    
    
      
    
    The next final was the long jump. MIT was seeded to score 15 points while Coast Guard was set to score 21. Stephen Morton came through on his final attempt to jump 22-4 1/4 for the victory and Anthony Teixeira jumped 21-8 3/4 to claim third. Their efforts combined with an eighth place jump by Mattias Flander netted 17 points while Coast Guard slipped to second and fourth place for only 13 points. The high jump went almost as expected as MIT scored no points while Coast Guard scored 17, three less than expected. 
    
    
      
    
    Back on the track, the steeplechase was a huge breakthrough and made up for the surprise results of the 10K. Freshmen Paul Welle and Richard Prevost, distant third and fourth seeds, ran 18 second personal bests to place first and second respectively with times of 9:34.34 and 9:35.62. Rocco Repetski ran to a season best of 10:04.13 for sixth place, giving MIT 21 points, seven more than planned for.
    
    
      
    
    In the Javelin, Vlad Sobes had a huge personal best of 189-4 to move up to place third after being seeded sixth. Coast, seeded to score 21 points only netted 16, another tough blow for the Bears. Also in the field events and perhaps the most crushing blow, Coast Guard's second vaulter no-heighted and MIT displayed the best vault day in school history when Greg Tao (15-6), Patrick Barragan (14-9) and Nate Sharpe (13-3 1/2) all jumped to personal bests and Omari Stephens cleared 14-9 before bowing out with a tight groin for a 1-2-3-7 finish. 
    
    
      
    
    In the 1500, Jake Ruzevick continued his comeback with a 4:00.15 third place effort. Accompanying Ruzevick's performance were Joy Roy-Mayhew running 4:04.68 for fifth and Chris Wong at 4:05.56 for sixth. In one of the few events that did not go quite as well as MIT would have liked, Teixeira had a bad race in the high hurdles, placing fifth while Dave Fernholz did not even make the finals after being seeded seventh. Fortunately, the fourth seeded Stephens moved up to second place to minimize the losses.
    
    
      
    
    Stephen Oney ran his best race of the outdoor season with a 50.86 in the 400, good for sixth place. Right after that, Morton came through as the number one seed in the 100 as he claimed first running a 11.32 into a 2.3 meter per second head wind. Coast Guard scored four points less than they were seeded to continue their slide.
    
    
      
    
    In the triple jump, Morton still could not find his indoor form as he only jumped 44-2 3/4 for fifth place. Fortunately, Teixeira continued his outstanding day with a third place 45-3 1/2 jump and Mattias Flander leaped to a fourth place 44-9 3/4 effort. However, Coast Guard managed to win the event and three more points than they were seeded to score.
    
    
      
    
    Nick Leonard ran a well timed personal best as he continues to learn and improve in the 400IH. Leonards' time of 57.19 gave him a third place finish, one place higher than expected. The 800, the event MIT needed the most, gave MIT 14 more points as Matt Bieniosek led teammates Bill Phipps, Dave Reshef and Kevin Kleinguetl to the finish line in 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th places with respective times of 1:57.44, 1:57.65, 1:57.78 and 1:58.51. Again, Coast Guard was seeded to score 18 points and only pulled out 15.
    
    
      
    
    Tony McDonald led the throwers with placing in three different events, placing fifth in the hammer with a 151-10 effort, sixth in the discus at 130-3 and sixth in the shot at 44-0 3/4. While McDonald scored in three events, James Oleinik made his two events count. Oleinik won the shot with a put of 48-10 1/4 and placed second in the discus with a personal best of 137-9. The discus was one of MIT's best events of the day as the Engineers scored three more points than they were seeded thanks in part to the seventh place finish by Mitch Kelley while Coast Guard dropped nine more points by only scoring nine as two of their top seeds failed to score.
    
    
      
    
    In the 200, Morton ran cautiously, ending up with the second place he was seeded to get. However, Teixeira, not seeded to score pulled out a personal best of 22.95 to place fifth and again move MIT up in the scoring column. The final individual event of the day, the 5000, totally sealed the meet for MIT. Roy-Mayhew backed up his fine 1500 with a well run 15:22.12 victory. Supporting his effort, Hemagiri Arumugam, Brian Jacokes and Chris Wong placed third, fourth and fifth respectively to score 27 for Tech while Coast Guard only managed six after being seeded for 10.
    
    
      
    
    MIT ran season bests in both the 400 and 1600 meter relays. In the 4x100, the foursome of Teixeira, Leonard, Flander and Morton placed third in 43.23. In the 4x400, the final event of the meet, Oney, Reshef, Bieniosek and Kleinguetl placed third in 3:22.98.
    
    
      
    
    Next weekend, MIT travels to Coast Guard for the New England Division III Championship where the Bears will want some revenge and the opportunity to prove they are the better team.

    **Morton Leads Engineers With Varsity Record in the 100 Meters**

    The MIT Track and Field team rewarded themselves after a long week of very hard work  by competing in the Point Loma Invitational hosted by Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego. MIT finished second with 274 points in the 12 team meet despite leaving more than half the team back at MIT and with some of those on the trip not competing in their full complement of events. The scoring was a bit unusual in that no more than two individuals from a team could score in any event and the scoring went 15-13-12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1. 
    
    
      
    
    The spring trip began with five very hard days of work at Claremont McKenna Scripps Colleges. If the work alone did not get to the athletes then the heat certainly took its toll. By the end of the week, when the Engineers travled south to Point Loma for the meet, the entire team was dragging. However, knowing the hard work would pay huge dividends later in the season, the MIT athletes decided they would rather not wait until later, shrugged off their fatigue and ran, jumped and threw to many personal bests. 
    
    
      
    
    Tony McDonald got things going on Friday evening with a nice hammer throw of 137-8, a personal best good for fourth place. The team then went to a reception to welcome the MIT class of 2012 from the San Diego area before going over to Jake Ruzevick's home for a very nice home cooked meal. This, along with the other hosted meals by Chris Bateman, '07 and Chris Khan, '03, gave the team the fuel they needed to bring it on on Saturday.
    
    
      
    
    Paul Welle and Richard Prevost raced in their first ever 3000 Steeplechase, taking charge at the start and running excellent rookie times of 10:05.5 and 10:14.6 to place first and second in the event. The only other victory for MIT came at the hands, or rather the feet, of Stephen Morton. Despite tight and sore hamstrings, Morton managed an MIT record of 10.79 in the 100 meters despite a poor start and rough first 30 meters.
    
    
      
    
    Second place honors went to Kevin Kleinguetl, who ran the 800, leading from start to almost the finish in a great 1:55.72 time. Omari Stephens also earned runner-up with his 15-7 vault, continuing his successful vaulting from the indoor season. Also claiming second place was James Oleinik in the shot put with a heave of 46-10 1/4. Earning a tie for tenth on the MIT Outdoor Track and Field top 10 list for the triple jump, freshman Mattias Flander leaped 45-10 to also place second. Flander had a jump over 46' that was clearly legal but the official made an admitted error, calling the jump a foul causing the rakers to remove the mark before the judgement could be corrected.
    
    
      
    
    Both the 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams placed third despite very little work and perhaps the best team not being in place. Anthony Teixeira, only running the relay due to his over worked hamstrings, led the 4x100 off with a fine leadoff leg. Nick Leonard, running the second leg, surprised all with his speed as he held his own down the backstretch. Mattias Flander started the third leg well but fatigued towards the end, and combined with Stephen Morton leaving a bit early, he was unable to catch Morton without Morton nearly stopping at the end of the exchange zone. Despite all this, Morton passed teams down the home stretch, earning the team a respectable 43.31 performance. Running the 4x400 with three 800 runners and one multi-eventer, no one expected the team to place third, with the exception of those running the race for MIT. Matt Bieniosek led off with a nice 51.5 leg, which was followed by a 52.6 leg by a fatigued Bill Phipps. Leonard again surprised everyone by running an excellent 51.3 leg. Kleinguetl finished the leg off with an outstanding 51.2 anchor to put the team in third. Also placing third was Morton in the long jump with a 21-10 1/4 performance. The final third place for Tech was earned by Brian Jacokes, who fought off the pain and fatigue to race to a very respectable 15:36.37 for his outdoor personal best.
    
    
      
    
    There were three fourth place efforts by MIT, but none were more welcome that the 167' throw in the javelin by freshman Vlad Sobes. It has been a few years since the Engineers had a good javelin thrower. In addition to McDonald's throw in the hammer, Morton also earned fourth place but was also the victim of a poor judging call in the triple jump, missing out on a 46'+ mark. Instead, he settled for a 42-9 1/2 performance for the fourth place. 
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT hosts the annual Engineer's Cup against RPI and WPI on 4/5 at 12:00.

    **ENGINEERS WIN, FINISHING UNDEFEATED BUT IN SLOPPY FASHION**
    
    
      
    
    April 12, 2008
    
    
      
    
    The prospects of a good day weather wise were slim to none and that seemed to pervade the attitude of the MIT Engineers throughout the day. The weather held up, but for the most part the men's team did not. Although the team won the meet ( MIT 224, Bates 171, USM 156, Colby 106) and finished the season undefeated it was one of those victories one just does not feel good about heading into the championship part of the season.
    
    
      
    
    Traveling to Waterville, Maine, a three hour drive, on a cold, supposedly spring day for a meet against host, Colby College, Bates College and the University of Southern Maine, MIT did not start the trip off well, as the number two vaulter, Greg Tao missed the bus. To make matters worse, a major accident on the Maine Turnpike involving a double trailer UPS truck, that closed the Pike, caused the MIT team to get to the meet only 15 minutes prior to the start of the meet. Graciously, Colby moved the MIT field event competitors to the second flight in the throws and horizontal jumps to allow for a better warmup. 
    
    
      
    
    The 10K, a non-scoring event in this meet, was first up on the track. Looking for an easy run and to qualify for the New England Division III Championship in three weeks, Brian Jacokes, Joe Roy-Mayhew and Chris Wong went 1-2-3 and easily qualified, running 32:20.00, 32:20.09 and 32:47.50 respectively. The qualifying time was 34:00 and the fact the threesome ran so comfortably bodes well for the weeks to come.
    
    
      
    
    The distance runners got the job done in other events as well. In the 3000 Steeplechase, freshmen, Richard Prevost and Paul Welle, dueled throughout the race all the way to the finish line, both running personal bests of 9:52.70 and 9:52.94 respectively. In the 5000 meter race, the places were not so high but the season improvement was significant as all three MIT runners ran season bests. In a strange race that saw two Bates College runners tear out in a very fast 200 and a quality field including nationally qualified 10K runners, the Wheeler twins from USM holding back, the MIT runners stayed in the middle of the pack running 5:00 mile pace. Gihan Amarasiriwardena tried to stay with the chase group, but got dropped after the 3200 mark. Jack Bourbonnais, running consistent, but conservative pace, passed his teammate, placing fifth with a time of 15:42.11. Trevor Rundell ran a competitive race through 3200 meters then lost focus as he struggled home with a final mile of 5:17.
    
    
      
    
    The pole vaulters had to go inside because of the weather considerations and certainly did not seem to suffer for it. Omari Stephens, running back and forth between the indoor and outdoor track as he negotiated the trials and finals of the hurdles and the start of the men's vault, won easily, vaulting 15-9 for the second week in succession. With Tao not available and presumably asleep back at MIT, Patrick Barragan proved he is in championship form to stay as he vaulted 13-9 1/4 for third place. In addition, Nate Sharpe placed sixth, vaulting 12-9 1/2 and Travis Hery placed seventh with a 12-3 1/2 vault, quite good for the freshman decathlete.
    
    
      
    
    In the throws, James Oleinik had a solid day. He won the shot put with a throw of 48-6 and placed third in the discus with a 133-0 personal best. Tony McDonald had a solid day even though he had no personal bests. Placing fourth in the discus, fifth in the shot and fourth in the hammer provided MIT with some solid points. Also placing for MIT in the shot, Adam Mustafa and Mitchell Kelley placed seventh and eighth respectively with marks of 38-9 1/4 and 37-6. In the hammer, Coco Agbeyibor threw a nice PR of 136-6 to finish sixth. Although he did not place, Mustafa threw a personal best of 126-1.
    
    
      
    
    There were some other good performances but they did not happen with the normal frequency one expects when watching the men's track and field team. Stephen Oney began his season, after missing the last two meets for graduate school interviews, with a 51.76 400, good for second place. In the 800, most of the MIT runners were in the tank on this particular day, but Dave Reshef, running his first 800 this season ran a fine 1:59.85 for eighth place. Omari Stephens competed very well in the 110HH, winning with a season best of 15.28.
    
    
      
    
    Whether the MIT athletes were fatigued, not mentally prepared or some combination of both, they will need to improve if they hope to have a successful championship season.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT hosts their Spring Invitational on Saturday, their last meet before defending their NEWMAC Conference Championship.

    **TECH TUNES-UP AND RESTS FOR UPCOMING CHAMPIONSHIPS**
    
    
      
    
    April 19, 2008
    
    
      
    
    After the apparent fatigue displayed at the previous meet, many of the MIT Engineers were given an easy week, including competing in only one event, or not at all, in the MIT Spring Invitational. Good weather promoted solid performances for Tech in the non-scoring meet for those who did compete. 
    
    
      
    
    On the track, the most significant performance was run by freshman, Gihan Amarasiriwardena. Fighting off a cold and a strong wind, he qualified for the New England Division III Championship in the 5000 with a time of 15:32.70. Jack Bourbonnais also ran well, particularly given the conditions, clocking 15:43.37. In the 1500, Jake Ruzevick showed he is nearly back to his old self, running 4:03.77. Close behind Ruzevick were freshmen steeplers, Paul Welle (4:04.65) and Richard Prevost (4:05.27).
    
    
      
    
    In the hurdle events, Anthony Teixeira returned to hurdle form with a personal best of 15.21. Also running a personal best for Tech was Dave Fernholz, breaking 16 for the first time with a 15.96. In the 400IH event, Nick Leonard continued to improve, running 58.28.
    
    
      
    
    In the field events, many performances by MIT were of note. In the long jump, the second tier of Tech jumpers all improved with Michael Fitzgerald leading the way with a 19-4 1/4 jump. Right behind him in the standings were Adam Hartz at 19-4 and Oliver Yeh at 19-2 1/2. Similarly, in the triple jump, Mattias Flander jumped 45-5 3/4 to easily win the event and Obinna Anyanwu had his best jump of the year with his 43-1 3/4 effort. Also, in the high jump, Eric Beecher had his best jump of the year, clearing 5-10 3/4 and narrowly missing 6-1.
    
    
      
    
    Among the throwing events, the shot put was the best event for MIT. James Oleinik returned to 49' territory with a winning toss of 49-2 1/2. Throwing personal bests for MIT were Tony McDonald (44-1 1/4), Adam Mustafa (42-4 1/4), Coco Agbeyibor (39-3 3/4) and Mitch Kelley (38-9 3/4). In the discus, Oleinik again had the winning toss, throwing 128-4. Throwing for PRs were Mustafa at 121-10 and Kelley, also at 121-10.
    
    
      
    
    Next Saturday, MIT travels to Smith College to defend their NEWMAC Conference title, a meet they have won the past seven years in succession. Coast Guard appears to be the favored team with both good quality as well as depth in nearly all of the events. The Engineers will need their best effort of the year to come out ahead.
