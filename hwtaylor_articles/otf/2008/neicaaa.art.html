  <p align="left">May 9-10, 2008</p>
  <p align="left">Due to the end of the semester, which brings the due date for final projects, senior thesis and the approach of final exams, many All New England qualifiers from MIT ended their season with the New England Division III Championships. Once the individual championships begin only a few who have a shot at nationals and or those still improving continue in these last couple of weeks. The few that made this trip made the most of it, scoring 12 points in a tie for 20th place among the 37 scoring teams and many that did not score.</p>
  <p align="left">Leading the way for Tech was Omari Stephens in the pole vault. Stephens had a lot of trouble on the approach but persevered, managing to clear 15-9 and earn second place and tie his outdoor best. Greg Tao was not able to make the trip and Patrick Barragan had difficulty with the 14-3 opening height.</p>
  <p align="left">James Oleinik, who has been having an outstanding spring, added a foot to his personal best when he put the shot 50-10 to earn sixth place. Oleinik's first throw, a debatable foul, was even further.</p>
  <p align="left">In the long jump, Anthony Teixeira leaped to a personal best 22-5 for eighth place. Teixeira also had a minimum foul that was right around the 23-0 mark. In the triple jump, Teixeira could not find the magic in the legs and was unable to make finals. Stephen Morton, only triple jumping in this meet, could not find the technique that gave him the indoor school record at 47-11, managing only a 44-11 1/2.</p>
  <p align="left">In the javelin, Vlad Sobes threw 177-2 but just missed finals. Teixeira also competed in the 110HH but did not have his best day, running 15.46. </p>
  <p align="left">Next Thursday and Friday, MIT travels west to Springfield College to compete in the ECAC Division III Championship. Again, only a handful of MIT athletes will compete, attempting to get that NCAA qualifying mark.</p>
