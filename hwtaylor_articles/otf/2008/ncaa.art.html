  <p align="left">May 22-24, 2008</p>
  <p align="left">Omari Stephens finished his MIT career by earning All America honors at the <a href="ncaa.res.html">NCAA Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championship</a> hosted by the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. Clearing 14-11 in the pole vault, Stephens tied for eighth place, earning half a point for MIT. Greg Tao also competed in the pole vault and the sophomore also cleared 14-11, but finished 10th due to misses.</p>
  <p align="left">Stephen Morton, another sophomore, competed in the long jump. After placing eighth indoors in the long jump at these championships, Morton's hopes were high to improve on that mark. Jumping 22-3, Morton missed finals my one place, finishing in 10th place.</p>
  <p align="left">With two sophomores gaining such valuable experience the future looks very nice for the next two years.</p>
