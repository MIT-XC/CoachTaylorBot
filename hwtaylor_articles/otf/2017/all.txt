    ### Menkiti Sets Freshman Record, Women Win Bates Invite
    
    
                      
    
    ##### Men Suffer Loss to Bates
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 8, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    This weekend, Tech headed north to Lewiston, ME to take on Tufts University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the host, Bates College in the Bates Invitational.  On a day with temperatures peaking in the low 40's and wind gusts of up to 8 m/s at times, Tech was set to lock in on its first scored meet of the outdoor season.  Earlier in the week, it was questionable as to whether Bates would be able to host the College Invite due to snow and ice on the track; however, with a bit of warm rain and good luck, enough snow melted and was removed from the surface.  With only a few adjustments made to accommodate for snow that could not be removed, including moving the vertical jumps indoors, the meet provided Tech with a great opportunity to build off their strong start from a week ago on their Spring Trip.  As the competition came to a close, however, it seemed that the Engineers of MIT still have many questions to answer heading into the championship season.
    
    
                  
    
    Picking up where they left off from a week ago, the throws squad came up big at the Bates College Invite, churning out more strong performances and personal bests.  In the women's Discus, MIT looked to its standout throwers Jackie Vahey '17 and Ari Slutsky '18 to get the team rolling.  Captain, Jackie Vahey '17 continued her solid start in her specialty, slinging a throw of 136-03 ¼.  The day belonged to Ari Slutsky '18, however, narrowly edging her teammate with a season's best throw of 136-05 ¾.  Following the 1-2 punch of the women's Discus, the highlight of the day came in the men's competition as Cody Bratten '18 continued his hot streak.  Not fazed by the wind or cold, Bratten '18 unloaded his first throw of the day, launching the disc to a new personal best of 167-05 and adding over two meters to his previous best set a week ago.  Bratten's throw will most likely qualify him for the NCAA Outdoor Championships in May, is currently the third best throw in the country, and is the second best throw in MIT history.
    
    
                  
    
    In the horizontal jumps, Tech's men took advantage of the tail winds and the sluggish Long Jump performances of their counterparts, adding 16 points to the team total with three of the four jumpers reaching new personal bests in the process.  MIT was led by junior, Jason Villanueva, who took third with a leap of 20-10, improving his personal best set just a week ago.  Chris Washington '20 and Shane Lyons '20 also improved their previous best marks by jumping 20-07 and 20-02 ½, good for fourth and fifth place finishes.  In the women's Triple Jump, Freshmen Jasmine Jin struggled to find the right mindset in the wind and cold but managed to pull it together to jump 35-04 for second place.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, the MIT Steeplechasers were poised to make a strong statement in their season debuts.  In the women's race, Jenna Melanson '20 owned the field from start to finish, showing off her hurdling acumen and breezing to a first-place finish in a time of 11:15.19, over 23 seconds faster than the nearest finisher.  In the men's race Aidan Gilson '19 and Ben Freed '18 braved the cold and wind to run a smooth and decisive race.  Gilson '19 proved to be too much for Freed '18, winning in a time of 9:45.70.  Freed '18 finished in a time of 9:49.80, holding off Bates' Ferguson-Hull for a second-place finish.  In the 4x100 relay, the Tech women's squad looked to atone for last week's disqualification.  The team of Hannah Chen '18, Michelle Menkiti '20, Jane Reed '20, and Nneoma Okonkwo '18 did just that, getting the baton around the track in smooth fashion, running away with the victory in a time of 48.75.
    
    
                  
    
    Meanwhile, the vertical jumps were heating up indoors where the weather was a calm 70 degrees.  In the women's High Jump, Natalie Alper '17 continued her winning ways clearing 5-04 ¼ on her second attempt and running away with nine more points for the Tech team score.  Alper '17 once again took three solid attempts at 5-06, which would have improved upon her school record leap of a week ago, but narrowly missed.  In the men's Pole Vault, Scott Cameron was out for redemption following a no height performance in San Antonio, TX, while Bobby Upton '20 set his sights on improving his freshman record set a week ago.  The day was Cameron's, flinging himself over the 15-05 bar for the win, outdoing his teammate Upton '20 who finished second with a jump of 14-11.  Freshman Raja Rajcic unfortunately no heighted for the second week in a row.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, the 1500m had an old, familiar face in Colin Godwin '17 who has battled back from a stress fracture to his femur earlier in the year.  Although the race was not his fastest, by any means, Godwin '17 ran with purpose in the whipping winds, posting a time of 4:06.36 for third place.  Continuing on from her strong hurdle performance at the Trinity Tiger Invite, Hannah Chen '18 took advantage of a 4.0 m/s wind to blast her fastest 100m hurdle performance in her time at MIT.  Her time of 14.68 was good enough for second place and is fifth all-time in MIT history.
    
    
                  
    
    In the throws ring, Junior Ari Slutsky '18 continued her competitive ways in the Shot Put unleashing another season's best performance of 40-09 ½ for yet another first-place finish.  Her teammate, Jackie Vahey '17 added her own season's best throw of 36-11 ½, good enough for third.  On the men's side, the Shot Put competition was quite pedestrian as no one threw beyond 15m the entire competition.  Junior, Cody Bratten was able to manage a fourth place toss of 45-06 ½, while Jon Fakkema '19 finished a disappointing 9th.  
    
    
                  
    
    In the men's Triple Jump, Tech looked to gain the edge on a field that did not seem to be enjoying Maine's early spring weather.  In the preliminary rounds, MIT did not take advantage as the trio of Jason Villanueva '18, Ryan Prinster '18, and Shane Lyons '20 failed to produce anything noteworthy.  After Lyons '20 fouled out of the competition, it was Prinster '18 who woke up, improving his best preliminary jump by nearly a meter, tying his personal best from a windy, short approach, jumping 45-02 ½ for the win.  Villanueva '18 finished 2nd.  In the women's Long Jump, Tech's top jumpers Nneoma Okonkwo '18 and Haley Strouf '18 fought off a feisty Bates tandem of Sally Ceesay and Srishti Sunil to finish 1-2 with jumps of 18-03 and 18-00 ½.  Jumpers Jasmine Jin '20 and Kristen Frombach '19 improved their personal bests, with leaps of 16-10 and 16-09 ¼, respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    In the short sprints, the women's 100m proved to be helpful to the team score. With a 3.1 m/s tailwind Tech paced the field with Michelle Menkiti '20 and Nneoma Okonkwo '18 running 12.51 and 12.66 for first and second, respectively.  Menkiti's performance was a new MIT Freshman Record.  In the men's 100m, Danny Newman '17 better utilized the heavy tail wind of 4.9 m/s to run a personal best time of 10.95 which was good enough for second place.  In the women's 800m, Marissa McPhillips fought the wind to take second in a time of 2:20.56, while Clementine Mitchell '18 and Margaret Trautner '20, who saw her first action of the track season, placed fourth and sixth.  In the men's 800m, a heavily depleted Tech squad following injuries to freshmen Simon Alford and Tyndale Hannan, looked to sophomore Nathan Munet to get the job done.  Unfortunately, it was not meant to be as an ill Munet '19 finished a disappointing seventh in a time of 2:02.58.
    
    
                  
    
    Meanwhile, in the balmy confines of the Bates College indoor track facility, the men's High Jump and women's Pole Vault were underway.  On paper, the men's High Jump competition seemed destined to be a good one, however, due to the lack of energy in the building, the field did not deliver.  After a disappointing eighth place finish by freshman, Steven Speck, Chris Washington '20 seemed focused on winning the event for MIT.  Unfortunately, he was unable to find his rhythm, taking second and jumping a disappointing 6'4" in the process.  In the women's Pole Vault, the Tech women's crew did not look like their usual competitive selves, seeming erratic and inconsistent on their runways and takeoffs.  Despite the sub-par showing, the army of Engineer vaulters got the job done, finishing 1-2-3-4-5-7, scoring a grand total of 33 points.  It was MIT's Kari Stromhaug '19 who set the standard, finishing with a jump of 11-07 ¾ to win the competition.
    
    
                  
    
    Finishing up the track events, Hannah Chen '18 and Michelle Menkiti '20 finished 1-2 in the 200, running 25.59 and 25.79.  In the men's competition, senior Danny Newman, once again, utilized a 3.9 m/s wind and ran a blazing fast 22.07 for second place.  Sophomore Michael Amoako did the same, riding a 4.2 m/s wind to take third in a time of 22.44.  In the 5000m, Mary Eccles '18 ran a dominant race, fighting through the wind on the backstretch and making a big move to blow the race open on the sixth lap.  Eccles '18 did not look back from there, winning the race in a time of 18:03.25.  In the men's race, it was junior David Walter who was the Engineers' top finisher, coming in at 15:25.01.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event of the day, the Engineers of MIT looked to cap off an up and down competition with a strong closing to the day in the Hammer Throw.  After putting together impressive warm-up throws, Jackie Vahey '17 and Ari Slutsky '18 entered the competition with their focus on personal records rather than competing.  It was clear that both were pressing as their form began to shift from the effortless throws of warm-ups to the forced, tense throws of competition.  Despite leaving the door open to other competitors, no one was willing to walk through it, leaving Vahey '17 the victor with a throw of 159-04, while Slutsky '18 garnered second with a toss of 156-02.  In the men's competition, sophomore Jon Fakkema followed the women's lead, losing his technique during the competition but still managing a throw of 146-02, enough for third place.
    
    
                  
    
    When all was said and done, the MIT women's team finished first with a score of 235 to second place finisher Bates' 194.  The men's team, however, finished a disappointing second place, scoring 178.5 points and falling to Bates College by over 50 points.  Although there were bright spots, personal and season's bests, and many event wins throughout the competition, the Tech squads have yet to achieve the standard of success they seek to uphold.  Next week, the Engineers will face off with their arch rival Williams College in a dual meet battle in Williamstown, MA.  After an indoor season which saw MIT finishing behind the men of Williams College at the New England DIII Indoor Championships and the women's team falling just four points behind fourth place finisher Williams at the NCAA Indoor Championships, Tech has a lot to prove against the very formidable Ephs squads.  It will certainly take a more consistent, focused effort than was demonstrated in Lewiston, ME this weekend.  In addition, MIT will need the health of both teams to improve greatly to make a run at taking home both the men and women's dual meet titles.

    ### Deyo Leads Engineers in Early Season 10K
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    March 25, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    As in most years, when the weather permits, MIT sent a handful of distance runners down to Bridgewater State University for a shot at qualifying in the 10K for the New England Division III Championship and possibly higher level championships.  Most meets during the season do not run the 10K, and the temperature tends to become less conducive to faster times as the season progresses.  The weather was near perfect in the women's race, and slightly windy in the men's race, but with the temperature in the low 40's one could not hope for a better situation.  
    
    
                  
    
    The qualifying times for the New England Division III Championship were fairly pedestrian at 33:20 for the men and 41:20 for the women, so for the MIT runners it was more a matter of competing well and running a reasonably fast time.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's male entries were hoping to lock onto a pace between 5:00 and 5:05 per 1600 meters.  Unfortunately for some of them, they all went out in 4:59-5:03, and some were not quite ready, either mentally or physically.  Matt Deyo 'G led the way after about a mile of Brian Gilligan '17 taking the lead from the gun.  Both came through in 4:59.  Deyo continued to run 74 pace, coming through 3200 in 9:55.  Gilligan fell off a bit, but was solid at 9:57.  Daniel Weiss '19 was next at 10:01, along with David Walter '18.  Josh Derrick '20 was one who had gone out strong, but started fading after the mile mark as he was simply using too much energy--not running relaxed.  Rory Beyer '18 was at 10:07, and Nicholas Waltman '18 and Alex Knoedler '18 were running better paced races, coming through at 10:10 and 10:11 respectively.  Over the next two miles Deyo continued his pace, hitting 6400 at 19:50.  Weiss was the next fastest at 20:17.  Gilligan was trying to hold on at 20:24, but was falling back.  Beyer was at 20:25, Waltman 20:27, Derrick 20:36, Knoedler 20:38 and Walter 20:41.  Deyo had been all alone since 2K into the race and nothing was changing.  As the wind picked up on the backstretch he slowed to a 4:58 on the fifth 1600, but then rallied with a 4:55 and 68 final quarter to win in 30:51.63.  This is not nearly a fast enough performance to qualify for Nationals, but shows that with competition he can certainly get the job done.  Weiss finished in a very solid 31:52.85 to place third.  Waltman placed sixth in 32:14.22, Gilligan eighth in 32:16.91, Beyer ninth in 32:26.57, Knoedler 10th in 32:28.20, Derrick 13th in 32:38.40 and Walter was 15th in 33:12.17, out of a total of 33 runners.  All MIT runners qualified for the New England Division III Championship
    
    
                  
    
    The women had raced first when there was no wind, but it was also pretty early in the day at 9:00 a.m.  The eventual winner, Kerri Ruffo '18 from Northeastern took the pace out hard, pulling everyone out a bit faster than they wished to go.  Camila Thanos '19 went out at a suicidal pace of 87, slowed a bit, but did not hit a reasonable pace until 1200 meters, still hitting the 1600 in 6:07.  Bailee Margolis '19, Darby LaPlant '19 and Charlotte Folinus '20 all went out in 90 for the 400, when they should have been back at 94.  This seemingly small difference would have a huge effect over 6.2 miles.  Thanos continued to widen the lead on her teammates through 2400 meters, when she went to 95 second pace.  Margolis and LaPlant were running as if they were on a mission, starting to negative split as they went from 6:20 to 6:14 in the second 1600. Folinus started falling off just before the 3200 mark.  Thanos pulled out with a foot injury after 2800 meters and Folinus after 5K due to digestive issues, which was in about 20:00.  Margolis and LaPlant continued to race well, putting in a 6:18 and then a 6:13.  When Margolis continued to pick up the pace, dropping a 6:06, LaPlant fell off, but still ran 6:16.  The final 1600 for Margolis was a 6:03, finishing her final quarter in 91 for a 38:45.10, a new personal best, to finish fourth overall and the top Division III runner.  LaPlant finished in sixth in 39:11.50.
    
    
                  
    
    The technical event athletes on the team will be in Texas for the Spring Trip this coming week, competing at Trinity University on March 31.

    ### MIT Athletes Perform Well in Final Qualifier
    
    
                      
    
    #### Prepare for NCAA Division III Championship
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                  
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 18, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    MIT hosted the NCAA Final Qualifier for the New England Region on the hottest day in May one can imagine for this area of the country.  The 95 degree heat was mitigated by a 15 mph breeze throughout the meet, aiding the sprinters and jumpers.
    
    
                  
    
    This was the last day where an athlete could achieve a qualifying mark for the NCAA Division III Championship.  Many MIT athletes performed well, but only a few took advantage and performormed personal bests.  Starting things off, the quartet of Hannah Chen '18, Michelle Menkiti '20, Jane Reed '20 and Nneoma Okonkwo '18 ran a season best of 47.72 in the 4x100 Relay.  Eventhough it was their best performance of the season, it still was not good enough to get them into the top 16 teams accepted into the NCAA field.  It took a 47.39 to make it into the championship.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Discus, both Ariela Slutsky '18 and Jackie Vahey '17 set season bests.  Slutsky won with a 151-8 1/4 all time personal best.  Vahey threw 141-11.
    
    
                  
    
    In the men's competition, Jon Fakkema '19 threw a personal best in the Hammer, a 171-11 1/4 performance.  
    
    
                  
    
    Tre Albritten '18 competed in an open event for the first time this season, running the 200 in 21.61.  His performance fell two tenths short of qualifying for nationals.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500, a loaded field, aided by a pacer taking the race out in 2:03, screamed through the 1200 at 3:04 and Colin Godwin '17 was at the front.  He finished strong, running a personal best 3:51.60.  However, this time left him two spots shy of making Nationals as he ended up 22nd in the country and only the top 20 for the men, and top 22 for the women per event were selected.
    
    
                  
    
    On Tuesday, Tech Track & Field heads for Geneva, Ohio and the Spire Institute for the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championship.  The following 15 student-athletes will represent MIT Thursday through Saturday.

    ### Three Out of Four Race to National Qualifying Times
    
    
                      
    
    #### Deyo and Melanson Set Records
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                  
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 21, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    MIT brought four athletes to Princeton to race in the Larry Ellis Friday night distance portion of the meet.  Leading off for the Engineers was Jenna Melanson '20 in the 3000 Meter Steeplechase.  Having set the MIT freshman record at 11:06 last week, the rookie was aiming to get a time fast enough to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship in five weeks.  With a crisp pace of 84 seconds to start off, Melanson averaged 85 as she came through the 1600 in 5:42.  Instead of racing, she now was just running, slowing to 89 pace and then 91 on the final full lap.  However, she was able to finish the final 200 in 44 to blow away her freshman record with a 10:55.17.  This time may be fast enough for Nationals, but will be very close.
    
    
                  
    
    Next up was Maryann Gong '17 in the 5K.  The senior has been battling a bone growth in her foot that has reduced her mileage over the past few weeks, allowing her to work on speed instead.  The goal was just to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship, adding the 5K to her qualifying effort two weeks prior in the 10K.  The leaders went out pretty hard in 77 for the first quarter.  The chase group, which included Gong, was running 81 pace initially, but that gradually picked up to 79's after a 5:25 first 1600.  At the 3200, Gong came through in 10:43 for a 5:18 second 1600, but had started to lose contact with the leaders of the chase pack.  Struggling with staying mentally engaged in the race, the last few laps she slowed to 83 pace before rallying for an 81 and then 39 final 200 to finish fifth in 16:52.36, accomplishing her goal.              
    
    
                  
    
    The final race for MIT was the men's 5K, featuring Matt Deyo 'G and Dennis Maloney '19.  Both got out well in the pack of 26 runners although they were towards the back at 67 pace.  The pace stayed steady, coming through the 1600 at 4:33.  A gap had separated Deyo and Maloney from the chase pack of 10 so Deyo set out to bridge that gap.  After two more laps an individual tripped right in front of the two Engineers, causing Deyo to hurdle him and Maloney to go around.  This created a gap between the two and Maloney never got back in the race.  Deyo ran a 4:38 second 1600, too slow to get him to Nationals.  He slowed to 71 for the next lap, but then rallied a bit with a couple of 70's and then a 67 before closing in 32 to not only run what is surely a National qualifying time of 14:21.28, but broke the 37 year old MIT record set by Colin Kerwin '82.  Maloney did not give up, but he did not race either, not connecting mentally.  His final time was 14:42.46.
    
    
                  
    
    All four competitors will next compete at the NEWMAC Conference Championship next Saturday at MIT.

    ### Vahey Sets Varsity Hammer Record at Nationals
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 25-27, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's Men's and Women's Track & Field team went to the NCAA Division III Outdoor Track & Field Championship, in Geneva, Ohio to put the finishing touches on an outstanding year and they certainly succeeded.  
    
    
                  
    
    The championship started with a banquet honoring the athletes and coaches who have made it to this prestigious championship.  This is also the time when the Elite 90 Award is presented, honoring the individual male and female student-athlete with the highest GPA attending this championship.  If there is a tie, the award goes to the one with the highest number of academic units.  MIT Track & Field / Cross Country has had five different individuals win this award in its brief history and Wednesday night they added two more, marking only the second time a program has had both the male and female honoree in the same season.  The previous time it was also MIT, as Kyle Hannon '13 and Lauren Kuntz '13 both won the award at the 2012 Indoor Track & Field banquet.  This year's winners were Maryann Gong '17 and Aidan Gilson '19, both having perfect GPA's in Course 6 (Computer Science and Electrical Engineering) and 20 (Biological Engineering) respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers were very busy during the first day of the three day championship.  Things began with the 10K at 9:45 in the morning.  Mary Eccles '18, seeded 19th going into the race was hoping to put herself in the mix for an All America slot (top eight), and started off at the right pace. A lead group of four broke off at the start with a 76 first 400, but then settled into 82 second pace, which the winner, Taryn Cordani '18 from Ithaca College held until a final 74 kick to run 34:41.11.  Eccles pace was a sound 86 second pace and she seemed very comfortable.  However, the effects of a cold along with an upset stomach got the best of her. She finished last in 38:40.29.
    
    
                  
    
    Dennie Maloney '19 represented MIT in the Men's 10K.  Seeded ninth, the sophomore knew he had a good chance of placing well.  Maloney started out in the back of the pack, but eased to the front as the pace picked up from an initial quarter in 75 to a very quick 70 pace.  A group of five separated from the pack and Maloney was in that front group.  The pace was quick with the 1600 split of 4:47 and the 3200 split 9:30.  Maloney look great, almost bored.  The pace slowed a bit to 72 second pace and this caused Maloney to relax a bit, giving him a side stitch he was unable to shake.  His 5K split was 14:54, he still felt great and was in a solid fourth place.  However, once the side stitch hit he could not recover and fell back in the pack.  He recovered at the end, but could only manage a 10th place in 30:36.07.
    
    
                  
    
    It had been raining all day and did not show any signs of letting up.  Ariela Slutsky '18, seeded 12th in the Discus, was in the first flight and the highest seed in that flight.  She only threw 43.22 meters to finish fifth in that flight as the rain was giving everyone a hard time releasing the discus.  The second and seeded flight, apparently had even more problems with the rain.  Slutsky made finals and was in eighth place.  She was passed on the second round of finals, moving her out of placing.  On her final throw, as she has a history of doing, Slutsky threw 144-9 to move into sixth place, earning the first MIT points and taking home her first All America trophy.
    
    
                  
    
    While the Discus was going on so was the Women's Pole Vault. MIT had two entries, Jen Tylock '17 seeded 18th, and Kari Stromhaug '19 seeded 22nd.  The opening height was 11-7 3/4 and both Tylock and Stromhaug cleared the height as well as 12-1 1/2.  Tylock needed two attempts to clear both while Stromhaug was clean, making both heights on her first attempt.  At 12-5 1/2 both made it on their second attempts, giving both a new personal record.  In every other Division III Track & Field National Championship this would make All America, but this year 14 women made the height.  At 12-7 1/2, Stromhaug cleared on her second attempt, but Tylock was unable to make it, finishing 13th.  Stromhaug did not clear 12-9 1/2, but earned 8th place on fewer misses to claim her second All America honor this year.
    
    
                  
    
    Katie Bacher '20, seeded 20th in the 1500 was ready and did not seem to be bothered by the atmosphere at Nationals.  Having already competed at both the Cross Country and Indoor Track & Field national championships this year, the freshman seemed very relaxed.  She ran at the back of the pack, stayed on the rail and did not panic.  The initial pace of 72 was perfect, but then slowed to a 76.  It picked  up to a 73 for Bacher, but she could not kick with the leaders, managing a solid 53 final 300 for a 4:34.70. She finished 13th overall, missing finals my one place.
    
    
                  
    
    Hannah Chen '18 started her quest for her third straight All America in the 400IH.  The junior was seeded sixth going into the race.  She had a solid start and a very nice first hurdle.  She had to stutter a bit on the second hurdle, falling behind early.  However, her strong finish carried her to a 61.70, the seventh overall qualifier for Saturday's final.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Men's Discus, Cody Bratten '18, seeded ninth was about to find out how he would perform in the rain.  Unfortunately the big junior could not grip the discus, only throwing 139-9 to finish 18th.
    
    
                  
    
    The final events on the track for MIT the first evening was the Men's and Women's 3,000 Meter Steeplechase.  Jenna Melanson '20 was up first.  The first heat of the women's race was a slow tactical race (10:57.19).  Given the formula for advancement (top 5 from each heat and the next four fastest), the second heat should have it pretty easy.  Although the first lap was a quick 82 seconds, Melanson felt it was uncomfortably slow and took the lead.  By the time she came through the 1600 in 5:34 there was no one near her.  She was able to cruise the rest of the way with a 10:44.81 victory, advancing to the finals.
    
    
                  
    
    Aidan Gilson '19 was out to show he could get the job done with his legs as well as his brain.  The ninth seed, tucked in behind favorite Luke O'Connor '17 from Tufts when it was clear no one wanted to to take the pace out hard.  The first heat ran 9:18.17, so a reasonably quick effort could get the top eight or nine in from the second heat, but no one wanted to push the pace.  Gilson stayed with the leaders through a 5:01 first 1600 and then stayed in fourth position through the finish for a 9:20.70 to finish eighth overall and qualify for Saturday's final.
    
    
                  
    
    The final event of the day for MIT was the Women's Long Jump.  Nneoma Okonkwo '18, a two-time All America winner in the event, was seeded ninth in a very talented field.  The junior had been limited in practice with a bad case of shin splints, walking around in a immobilizing boot for the past couple of weeks, so making the finals was not a sure thing.  It only took 18-4 to make finals, but Okonkwo could only manage 17-11 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two was essentially a day off for the Engineers.  Only Chen competed, taking on the 100HH.  She got out well but hit a few hurdles en route to a 14.80 performance, finishing 17th overall.
    
    
                  
    
    The final day of the meet, Saturday, began for MIT with the women's Hammer Throw.  Jackie Vahey '17, seeded 15th, threw a personal best of 53.41 meters to place third in the first flight and ninth overall in the trials to make it into the finals.  In the finals, on her final throw she threw a new MIT record 181-1 to move into seventh place.  Ariela Slutsky doubled back from the Discus to finish 14th at 166-8.
    
    
                  
    
    As the Hammer was going on, the Steeplechase final was starting.  The race turned strategic right away, which made Melanson a little uncomfortable.  The bunched pack did not allow her to approach the barriers as efficiently as usual.  She disengaged for two laps, falling back to 89 second pace before finally moving in the final lap, closing the final 200 in 39 seconds to move into fifth place with a time of 10:44.62, an impressive feat for the freshman.
    
    
                  
    
    The Men's Steeplechase was next.  Before the start of the race, Gilson looked as though he was in shock, overwhelmed at where he was and what was about to take place.  He started the race well, putting himself in great position threw 1600 meters, splitting 4:55, but then disengaged completely, falling back to 11th place in 9:25.19.
    
    
                  
    
    Bobby Upton '20 was the 20th seed going into the Pole Vault, so expectations were low, but the talented freshman has the ability to do well nationally, so MIT hopes were high.  However, he was not able to clear the 15-3 opening height.
    
    
                  
    
    Chen was back in the final of the 400IH.  In lane nine, she had no one to run off of, but started out well if not a little slow.  She lost the stagger on the backstretch, but finished well to nab seventh place in 61.46.
    
    
                  
    
    The final events for MIT were the Men's and Women's 5K.  Maryann Gong '17 was up first.  The 15 time All America winner has had a difficult spring, dealing with injury and illness causing reduced mileage and a lack of confidence.  The senior went with the leaders through a quick 5:13 opening mile but it was obvious that she was not committed to that level of running.  Once she disengaged from the lead group, she basically gave up the race.  Gong finished in 17:40.10, not the way she wanted to go out.  However, she has brought a lot of accolades to MIT in her four years, raising the program to a higher level than when she arrived and she will be missed.
    
    
                  
    
    Matt Deyo 'G was in his final race as well.  The gutsy graduate student is extremely determined and scoring in the 5K was on his agenda.  With the temperature in the low 70's and the sun bright, no one was anxious to take the pace out too hard.  The pack strung out but remained intact through a first mile in 4:39.  Deyo slowly moved up, about one person per lap.  Just before the 3200 mark the leaders began to open a gap, splitting 9:21.  Deyo was slowly moving up to scoring position, but did not make a serious move until 600 to go.  Running a 64 lap moved him into fifth place briefly, but he fell off in the final 200 meters, placing seventh in 14:30.80, 1.61 seconds out of fifth.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were only seeded to score 10 points and ended up in a tie for 20th place with 12 points.  The men, not seeded to score at all, scored two points on Deyo's finish, putting them in a tie for 72nd.  It was not the best Nationals for the Engineers, but there is a lot of talent back at MIT waiting to develop next year as well as an excellent incoming class of freshmen.  The Engineers hope to be back, contending for a much higher finish in the years to come.

    ### MIT Defends New England Division III Titles
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 5-6, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    Three weeks ago, MIT visited Williams College for a good old-fashioned dual meet, a meet in which both the men and women lost to the Ephs.  The Engineers may have lost the battle, but they won the war, winning the New England Division III Championship at Williams today. Both the men and women have stepped up their game in the first two weeks of the championship season.  Despite injuries and illness, those who were healthy rose to the occasion and got the job done, and then some. The men won against 32 scoring teams with 123 points.  The closest team was Tufts with 98, while Bates finished third with 87.5 and then came Williams with 76.5. The women's meet, despite 32 scoring teams, turned into a dual meet between the two rivals as MIT scored 167 points to Williams 153.5, but was not decided until the final event.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT knew they would have to come out swinging and hit Williams hard in the early events, putting doubt in their mind and showing that the Engineers came to win.  With the pouring rain and cold temperatures, MIT was in their element as they focused competing while their opponents were distracted by the weather. In the men's Hammer, Jon Fakkema '19, not seeded to score, placed fifth with a PR of 165-0 on his final throw.  In the 10K, MIT thought they may be able to place 1-2-3, which would be 24 points.  They did that one better, placing 1-2-3-4 for 29 points.  Dennis Maloney '19 and Matt Deyo 'G, easily the top seeds, planned to just run 31:30 pace and help out their teammates and save something for the 5K the following afternoon.  For Deyo this meant sacrificing a perfect weather opportunity to add the 10K as a national qualifying event to his current spot in the 5K.  Daniel Weiss '19 was running with his teammates and the trio opened up a 15 second gap on the second pack, which was led by Alex Knoedler '18.  Knoedler was being held back by his coach, but after 6400 meters he was given the green light to move ahead of his group.  After 8000 meters their coach told the first three they could back off as they were starting to drop Weiss and slowing might help Knoedler pull away from his group.  Knoedler moved past Weiss with four laps to go and caught up with Maloney and Deyo who were just cruising at this point.  The three finished together, all running 31:44 with Maloney finishing slightly ahead of Knoedler and Deyo. Weiss was running as fast as he could in the final lap to stay ahead of a fast closing Williams runner, finishing with a 69 to hold onto fourth place.              
    
    
                  
    
    The 34 points by the men in the first evening was impressive and put the team 12 points up on Williams after day one.  The women did even better.  Nneoma Okonkwo '18 won the Long Jump with a season best 19-3 1/4 and Haley Strouf '18, seeded sixth going into the competition, finished third with a season best jump of 18-7 1/4 for 13 points in the event.  In the Hammer, where Tech throwers were seeded third and fifth, both Ariela Slutsky '18 and Jackie Vahey '17 stepped up their game in the rain and 50 degree temperatures, placing second the third with throws of 169-3 and 165-6 respectively.  In the final event of the evening for the women, the 10K, MIT was hoping for a big 16 points.  Mary Eccles '18 took control of the race after 400 meters, dropping the pace to 86-87 per lap and leaving her competition to battle for the remaining places.  Eccles finished first in 36:07.96, currently 14th on the NCAA list.  Two of those battling it out for the remaining places were Tech's Bailey Margolis '19 and Darby LaPlant '19.  At first the two worked together, but after 1600 meters in 6:07 Margolis started pulling away.  After 3200 meters LaPlant caught back up and the two worked together for a 6:06 third 1600 and then a 6:08 before LaPlant first pulled ahead and then fell back.  All the while the pair had put themselves in fifth and sixth and they fought to stay there, both running PR's.  Margolis ran 38:24.95 and LaPlant 38:28.99, along with Eccles netting 17 points, one more than their seeds.
    
    
                  
    
    The women ended the first evening with 47 points, eight more than they were seeded while Williams had put 14 points on the board. The Engineers knew the very tough Williams team would come back strong, particularly with their potential points in the High Jump and Triple Jump.  To keep the Ephs on their heels MIT had to come out strong in the early events on Saturday and they certainly came through.
    
    
                  
    
    Jenna Melanson '20 delivered a crushing blow in the 3000 Steeplechase.  The freshman took the lead once the pace slowed during the second lap and the field let her go.  Coming through the 1600 in 5:38 she had a huge lead, but slowed at this point to 89-90 pace until the final 200 where she brought it home hard to secure the victory in a personal best 10:51.98.  That time puts Melanson at 10th in NCAA Division III and the top freshman in the country.
    
    
                  
    
    The men called that and raised it by 10 more.  Aidan Gilson '19 was fine with the top seed setting the pace until the final two laps.  At that point Gilson and teammate Ben Freed '18 dropped the pace from 76 to 73 and then 34's for the final 200 to go 1-2 in 9:18.89 and 9:21.97 respectively.  Brian Bates '20 delivered his patented sub 30 final 200 to go from ninth to seventh in a personal best 9:38.54 for a total of 20 points when they had only been seeded for 10.
    
    
                  
    
    In the very next event, the 4x100, the women were seeded third and had a reasonable chance of doing of placing higher.  However, on the final exchange, Okonkwo left early for the second week in succession, coming to nearly a complete stop in order to get the baton within the exchange zone.  Fortunately her speed allowed her to secure sixth place, but it was the first event that did not go in MIT's favor.
    
    
                  
    
    In the field events, the High Jump for the women went slightly better than expected.  Williams earned their expected 25 points and MIT earned an extra half point as Natalie Alper '17 tied for fourth at 5-3 when she had been seeded fifth.  Williams did pick up some points in the Triple Jump.  They were seeded to score 14, but managed to secure 18 to inch closer to MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    For the men, Scott Cameron '19 won the Pole Vault in very high and variable wind with a successful vault of 15-1 3/4.  Bobby Upton '20 placed third at 14-8 and Raja Rajcic '20 earned fifth place to give their team 20 points, one more than they were seeded to score.  All the while, the men's team from Williams was imploding, taking themselves out of the battle for first place.  However, Tufts University, and Bates College were stepping up, Tufts hoping to add the outdoor title to their indoor victory.
    
    
                  
    
    The throwers for the Engineers picked up where they left off the day before.  Cody Bratten '18, seeded seventh in the Shot Put, placed fifth with a 48-3 1/4 toss to give his team two bonus points.  Meanwhile, Slutsky and Vahey took first and second in the Discus, which they were seeded to do.  The wind was certainly not favorable for big throws, but the pair got the job done.  Slutsky threw 134-7 and Vahey 134-1.  Trading circles, Slutsky then placed third in the Shot Put with a fine 41-5 3/4 season best.  Bratten was seeded first in the Discus, and although the junior threw well with a throw of 155-2, he was unable to place higher than third.  However, Albert Menio '20 earned an unexpected point by placing eighth with a personal best of 136-5.
    
    
                  
    
    Back on the track, the 1500 looked to be a big event for MIT.  Maryann Gong '17 was seeded third but that was it for Tech.  However, Katie Bacher '20 and Marissa McPhillips, championship beasts, had something to say about that.  A solid pace was set early with a 72 initial lap.  Although it slowed a bit to 2:27, it picked up again as Gong tried to steal the victory.  She was not able to hold the lead, but Bacher came out of nowhere to move past her for third in a PR of 4:34.50.  Gong was right behind her in a season best 4:34.61.  McPhillips, showing an excellent kick of her own, placed sixth in 4:36.47.  The eight additional points would come in handy.  Colin Godwin '17, running out of the slow section, demolished his competition with a 1:48 final 700 meters to run 3:55.52 in the extremely windy conditions.  This held up for eighth place overall for another unexpected point.
    
    
                  
    
    In the hurdles, Hannah Chen '18, who had run an excellent 14.74 in the trials the day before, got a horrible start, falling behind immediately.  She battled back a bit to finish in fifth at 15.09, but the meet was slowly swinging the momentum in Williams favor.
    
    
                  
    
    Jane Reed '20 lowered her personal best in the 400 with a 58.11, also placing eighth out of the slow section.  Although they did not score, Henry Tareque '17 ran a huge PR of 49.55 to tie for 13th.  Brandon Corts '17 also finished his career with another personal best of 50.26.
    
    
                  
    
    The women, seeded 1-2 in the 100, got their wings clipped when Okonkwo did not qualify for the final from Friday's prelims.  Menkiti did place third in a fine 12.12, so MIT only lost an expected eight points.  In the very next event, the 800, Williams fortunately gave those points back by only scoring nine points when they had been seeded to score 22.  Although she was unable to score out of the slow section, McPhillips finished ninth with a PR of 2:14.92.  Bacher, also ran a PR of 2:16.38.
    
    
                  
    
    Danny Newman '17, seeded sixth in the 100, dropped one place, finishing in seventh in 10.94.  He later came back in the 200 to finish fourth in 21.84.  Between those events, Chris Sweeney '18 continued to work his way back from hamstring problems, moving up from his sixth seed to place third in a season best of 53.94 in the 400IH.  Chen came back from the high hurdles to perform in her premier event, the intermediate hurdles, which she was heavily favored to win.  The junior easily won in 61.25.  In the next event, the 200, Menkiti, seeded third, earned exactly that to keep MIT on pace.
    
    
                  
    
    As the teams entered the 5K, it was clear that the men would win the meet if they could earn their expected 14 points in the distance event.  For the women, the meet was really close with the 5K, 4x400, 4x800 and Pole Vault remaining.  Deyo and Maloney successfully made their double by placing second and third respectively in 14:36.11 and 14:37.95 to give Tech the needed 14 points and secure the victory, their fourth New England Division III Outdoor titel in a row.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were not as successful in the 5K.  Gong did not have one of her better days.  Surprised by the fast start by Emma Zehner of Williams, she lost confidence and faded badly even though she was the top seed.  Her fifth place was supported by a tough, hard fought seventh place by Eccles returning from her 10K, to give MIT six points.  Williams scored 16, two more than they were seeded to earn to pull within three points of MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x800 Williams was seeded first and MIT fourth.  MIT would be depending on the tough duo of McPhillips and Bacher to keep them in the mix.  Clementine Mitchell '18, who had run a season best of 4:45.47 in the 1500 earlier, came through with a solid 2:20.9.  Williams was in front, but Bacher closed the gap with a 2:16.9 despite having one shoe ripped off as she received the baton.  Tessa Weiss '20 ran an inspired 2:21.7 to put MIT in fourth going into the anchor.  McPhillips ran 2:15.1 in her third race of the day to bring MIT to second place in 9:14.82, the third fastest time in program history.  Williams was now one point behind MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 4x400, Williams again was the top seed while MIT was seeded fifth.  Reed led off with a 59.2 and Gabriella Zak '20 ran 59.4 to keep MIT in it.  Alper ran an excellent 58.0 and Chen finished with a 57.3 to move MIT into third place in 3:54.10, a season best.  Williams placed second to pull ahead of MIT by one point.  The meet would come down to the Pole Vault.
    
    
                  
    
    Earlier in the afternoon, the decision had been made to move the women's vault inside due to the dangerous wind conditions.  The competition was excellent and so were the results.  Williams took three points with a sixth place finish, but MIT locked up their fifth consecutive New England Division III Outdoor title and a clean sweep of the Cross Country, Indoor Track and Field and Outdoor championships by scoring 17.5 points with all MIT athletes cheering them on.  Jen Tylock '17 placed second in a PR of 12-4 1/2.  Kaitlyn Sparks '20 placed fourth, also jumping a PR of 12-4 1/2.  Kari Stromhaug '19 was fifth at 12-0 1/2 and Kathleen Brandes '19 tied for eighth at 11-6 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    The men finished the meet strong despite already having locked up the title.  In the 4x800 the team placed fourth after being seeded seventh when Nathan Munet '19 ran 1:56.1, Godwin delivered a remarkable 1:54.0, Gilson a 1:57.4 and Tareque a 2:01.0 after going out in 54.7.  The overall time was 7:48.77.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final event, the foursome of Corts (50.3), Michael Amoako '20 (49.5), Tom Frejowski '19 (51.4) and Newman (48.6) ran a season best 3:20.92 to place eighth. 
    
    
                  
    
    MIT will give their distance runners a much deserved break and prepare for Nationals.  The next meet is the NEICAAA Championship on May 12-13 followed by the NCAA Final Qualifier, hosted by MIT on May 18.

    ### Steeplers Breakthrough for MIT at All New England Championship
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    May 12-13, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    After the past two weeks of team championships, a toll had been taken on the mental side of the MIT Track & Field team.  At least that is how it appeared on day one of the NEICAAA Championship, a championship that brings together all Division I, II, and III colleges in New England.  With the distance runners and some jumpers resting this weekend, and the team not going for points, but only trying to improve performances for the NCAA Division III Championship in two weeks, the athletes seemed flat.  They competed well relative to the competition, but the energy just did not seem to be there, not for MIT and not for anyone else either, at least for day one of the championship.
    
    
                  
    
    Nneoma Okonkwo '18 and Haley Strouf '18 got things started in the Long Jump.  Both jumpers made it to the finals, but they were not jumping near their best.  In the final, both improved, moving up to first and fourth respectively, excellent places for the duo.  Okonkwo jumped 18-6 1/2 for the victory and Strouf jumped 18-1 1/2.
    
    
                  
    
    At the same time Jackie Vahey '17 and Ariela Slutsky '18 were representing the Engineers in the Hammer Throw.  Both performed well, placing seventh and eighth with Vahey throwing 170-3 and Slutsky 170-0.  Still the energy was just not there.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Pole Vault, the four entries from MIT again competed well, but no where near what they did the week before when the team counted on them.  Kari Stromhaug '19 placed fourth, clearing 12-1 1/2.  Kathleen Brandes '19 was seventh at 11-7 3/4.  Jen Tylock '17 and McKenzie Patarino '19 both cleared 11-1 3/4 but did not place.
    
    
                  
    
    Natalie Alper '17 jumped very well in the High Jump, placing sixth at 5-5.  Also doing well as things got started on the track was Hannah Chen '18.  Chen first ran 14.58 in the 100HH prelims, not her best time ever, but probably her fastest non wind-aided performance.  This got her into the finals the next day.  A little later Chen came back in the 400IH trials, placing second overall and winning her heat in 61.64.
    
    
                  
    
    Others were not so fortunate in the trials of the running events.  Michelle Menkiti '20 ran 12.36 in the 100 trials and 25.21 in the 200 trials, neither time quite good enough to make the finals.  On the men's side Danny Newman '17 ran 22.01 in the 200, Henry Tareque '17 50.89 in the 400 and Chris Sweeney '18 56.20 in the 400IH, none of them matching the performances from the week before or making it to the finals. 
    
    
                  
    
    The only field event on day one for the men was the Pole Vault.  Scott Cameron '19 injured his hamstring in winning the Pole Vault the week before, ending his season.  Bobby Upton '20 vaulted, but not his best, only clearing 14-5 1/4.
    
    
                  
    
    Day two needed to be better.  Things got going with the Men's Discus.  The results made everyone wonder if the Tech athletes could muster anything that would resemble a personal best.  Cody Bratten '18, like most of this teammates competed well, but also seemed flat.  He placed eighth with a throw of 150-9.  Jon Fakkema '19 threw 141-5.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track the women's 4x100 Relay was the first event.  Chen got out well and the handoff to Menkiti was also successful.  However, there was a hitch with the handoff to Jane Reed '20, causing Reed to slow as she neared the end of the zone.  The next handoff to Okonkwo was a little early in the zone due to a coach's error, causing the baton to slow through the zone.  The overall time of 48.85 was definitely off their best.
    
    
                  
    
    The 1500 was next and Colin Godwin '17 got things going.  The injury plagued senior was making the best of his final season, taking matters into his own hands when necessary.  Since he missed the first half of the season he had to race out of the slow section the week before and this weekend.  After a 62.0 first quarter and a 2:05.0 half, Godwin took the lead, picking up the pace significantly and never taking his foot off the gas.  The next quarter was a 61 and he then finished with a 45 final 300 for a 3:52.36 victory and personal best.  The fast section only produced two times faster than Godwin's, giving the senior third place overall.  Godwin provided the spark needed for a turn-a-round.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were next and MIT had Katie Bacher '20, Marissa McPhillips '20 and Maryann Gong '17 all hoping to produce national qualifying performances.  Bacher and McPhillips were in the second of three sections while Gong was in the fast section.  The pace for the second section was crisp at the 400 with Bacher towards the front in 71 and McPhillips in the back at 73.  Unfortunately the leaders slowed the pace and things bunched up.  The split at the 800 was 2:27, so Bacher and McPhillips started moving towards the front.  Entering the final lap the two were in the lead, splitting 3:41 and continuing on to finish 1-2 in their section with respective times of 4:34.70 and 4:35.69, a new PR for McPhillips.  Gong is still trying to find where she is mentally and it showed in the second half of her race.  After coming through the 800 in 2:22 and looking strong, she suddenly fell apart, finishing in 4:38.53.
    
    
                  
    
    Back to the field events, Bratten doubled back in the Shot Put, but could not find success there either, putting the shot 45-1 1/2.  In the Women's Discus, number one seed Slutsky, was leading going into the finals with a fine throw of 147-8, a mark that appeared to be farther, but was possibly mis-marked.  In the final another thrower passed her by eight centimeters, giving Slutsky second place.  Vahey earned eighth with a throw of 130-5.
    
    
                  
    
    The final events for MIT were the men's and women's 3000 Meter Steeplechase.  In the men's fast section, Aidan Gilson '19 and Ben Freed '18 were hoping to put a great race together and reach a sub 9:12, a mark that generally would make the national championship field.  Luke O'Connor '17 of Tufts, the top seed in the country for DIII at 8:58, took the pace out hard in 2:16 at the half.  Gilson made the pre-race decision to go with him and hung on well, looking very comfortable.  Freed led the chase group at 2:20.  O'Connor slowed the pace to 74-75 for the next three laps before picking up the pace.  Gilson stayed on pace with a 4:46 1600 with Freed doing the same at 4:50.  In the final 1000 meters, Gilson fell away from O'Connor, but stayed solid at 74-75 pace and even picked it up for a 36 final 200, running a huge PR of 9:05.61, the sixth fastest time in DIII.  Freed, slowed to 76 and then 77 in the final two laps, but closed in 35 for a 9:13.78, a PR that currently puts him 21st on the NCAA list.
    
    
                  
    
    Jenna Melanson '20, already 10th on the national list, was hoping to have a race where she did not lose focus in the latter stages, thus running closer to her potential.  The field was loaded with outstanding Division I talent, but all were much faster than Melanson.  Running towards the back of the pack she still came through a frighteningly fast 80 first quarter.  As she settled in, the pace slowed but gradually.  The planned pace was 86, which she did not hit until the third quarter.  The 1600 split was a crisp 5:36 as the freshman moved into fifth place  and was moving up on fourth.  Averaging 88 for the next three laps while she was in limbo with no one immediately in front of her, Melanson sped up at the end to finish in fourth in a new personal best of 10:43.41, the third time she has set the MIT freshman record.  This mark places Melanson fifth on the NCAA Division III list.
    
    
                  
    
    With five days remaining to qualify for Nationals, there will be a series of Final Qualifying meets around the country, one of which will be hosted by MIT, next Thursday evening.  The Engineers hope to get a few more on the list for the trip to Ohio.

    ### Balanced Attack Helps Engineers Defend NEWMAC Titles
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 29, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    The Men's and Women's Track & Field teams of MIT not only withstood the unusual 80 degree heat and high humidity, they overpowered the competition to win the NEWMAC Championship, the 17th in succession for the men and the ninth consecutive title for the women.  The Engineers won the meet with a balanced attack that gave the women 270 points, 153.5 more than runner-up WPI.  The men, seeded to win by about 50 points, prevailed with 291.5 points, 91 more than runner-up WPI.
    
    
                  
    
    The balance was not only between the field and running events, but also throughout the events within those respective disciplines.  For the women, the only event in which they did not score was the one they scratched from in order to not run up the score, the 4x400 Relay.  The men scored in all but the 110HH and Javelin, event areas where they are really void with the exception of decathlete Luke Gray '18, who is primarily a pole vaulter.  The men's field events scored 140.5 points while the runners collected 151 points.  The women's field events totaled 118 points while the track athletes scored 152.5.  The women earned nine victories, as did the men.
    
    
                  
    
    Michelle Menkiti '20, broke both of her freshman records as she finished second in both the 100 and 200 Meter sprints.  In the 100 the rookie ran an impressive 12.11, a .29 PR.  In the 200 she broke 25 seconds for the first time, running 24.85.  For her performances Menkiti earned co-Rookie of the Year for Track & Field in the NEWMAC Conference.
    
    
                  
    
    Two individuals earned double victories, Nneoma Okonkwo '18 and Hannah Chen '18.  Okonkwo won her primary event, the Long Jump with an 18-10 1/2 performance.  In the 100, Okonkwo ran a personal best 12.04 to edge Menkiti and set up a 1-2 finish.  Chen ran to a personal best in the high hurdles, running 14.46 for the victory.  In the 400IH, Chen won easily, running 62.61 despite the strong headwind on the backstretch. 
    
    
                  
    
    Jackie Vahey '17 totaled the most points for the women.  Vahey won the Discus with a throw of 135-3 1/2, finished second in the Hammer with a toss of 170-7 1/2 and put the Shot 39-6 1/4 to finish fourth in that event, totaling 23 points.  Both Okonkwo and Chen were on the victorious 4x100 relay, along with Menkiti and Jane Reed '20, which ran 47.80, giving both juniors 22.5 points.  The other 20 point scorer was another thrower, Ariela Slutsky '18.  The junior did not have her best day, but competed well, placing second in the Discus (133-9), third in the Hammer (168-4 1/4) and third in the Shot Put (40-0 1/4).
    
    
                  
    
    The most dominant event for the women was the 1500.  Tech earned 27 of a possible 29 points, which is limited by the NEWMAC rule of only allowing four entries per event.  Maryann Gong '17, a national qualifier in both the 5K and 10K, had not raced a 1500 as yet this season, and because of another NEWMAC rule had to run in the slow section with a seed of no-time.  This was unfortunate for the rest of the competition who missed an opportunity to compete against the 15 time All American.  Gong ignored the wind, ran splits of 71, 74, 74 and 57 for a solo 4:36.32.  In the seeded section, Marissa McPhillips '20 waited until less than 600 meters to go before she took the lead and pushed through for the section victory in a huge personal best of 4:38.51.  Katie Bacher '20 also ran a personal best, placing fourth in 4:43.78.  Clemmie Mitchell '18, still suffering the after effects of being sick, finished fifth in 4:56.46.
    
    
                  
    
    Natalie Alper '17 was another victor for the women.  Alper cleared 5-4 1/4 to win the High Jump on misses.  Jenna Melanson '20 cruised to victory in the 3000 Steeplechase, winning in 11:19.26.
    
    
                  
    
    The high point scorer for the victorious men's team was Jon Fakkema '19 with 26 points.  The sophomore had a very impressive day.  He started the day with a strong effort of 140-7 for second place in the Discus.  He then won the Hammer with a personal best of 164-3 1/4 and finished the day with another second place and a personal best of 45-5 1/4 in the Shot Put.
    
    
                  
    
    The only double winner for the Engineers was Cody Bratten '18, which earned him NEWMAC Field Event Athlete of the Year.  The junior won the Discus with a throw of 156-10 1/2 and the Shot Put at 48-2 1/4.  Having not throw the Hammer in over a year, he added one point by placing eighth in that event.
    
    
                  
    
    Arinze Okeke '17 showed significant improvement in his second week back.  He won the Triple Jump with a performance of 46-1 1/2 and placed second in the Long Jump with a leap of 21-11 3/4.  Scott Cameron also joined the winner's circle, earning the victory in the Pole Vault with a height of 15-5.  Danny Newman '17 had quite the day in the sprints, taking the 200 victory with a personal best of 21.68 and placing second in the 100 at 10.89.  Newman also led off the 4x100 Relay with teammates Michael Amoako '19, Ken Acquah '20 and Tre Albritten '18 to place third in a season best of 43.10.  Aidan Gilson '19 won the 3000 Steeplechase in a casual 9:39.81 and then came back to place fourth in the 400IH with a 58.86 performance.  Daniel Weiss '19 ran a great race in the 5K to win in 15:30.71.  The sophomore took the lead just past the 2K mark and never relinquished it, running 37, 35, 34 for 200 splits in the final 600 meters.  Alex Knoedler '18 used similar tactics, taking the lead with a strong move just 2900 meters into the race.  After a 5:10 first mile in the humid conditions, the pace began to slow, so after a lap in 82, the junior blasted to the front and never gave up the lead, winning in 32:37.96.
    
    
                  
    
    The most dominant events for the Engineers were the Shot Put and Triple Jump, both events netting 26 points.  After Bratten and Fakkema, Adam Estes '20 threw an amazing personal best of 40-7 3/4 for fourth place and Albert Menio '20 added a sixth at 40-2 1/2.  After Okeke's victory in the Triple Jump, Jason Villanueva '19 added a second at 44-6 3/4, Ryan Prinster '18 placed third with a 44-6 performance and Shane Lyons '20 jumped 40-8 1/4 for eighth place.  Just one point behind, the men's 5K earned 25 points with Billy Woltz '20 (15:46.37), David Walter '18 (15:55.69) and Steven Goldy '20 (15:56.67) placing third, fourth and fifth respectively behind Weiss's victory.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, both teams hope to successfully defend their New England Division III titles at Williams College.  Neither MIT team will be favored, but that has not prevented the Engineers from being victorious in the past.

    ### Gong and Maloney Race to NCAA Qualifying Performances
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 7, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    On a cold and windy night (40 degrees with 20 mph gusts), one had to wonder was this four hour drive south to Princeton University for the Sam Howell Invitational going to be worth the effort and time.  Well, with this being the best opportunity available this season to get an NCAA qualifying performance in the 10K, the athletes did not have the luxury of waiting for a better situation.  They had to make it happen and so they did.
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's 10K, Maryann Gong '17 made an ill-advised decision in assuming she was the best in the field and took the lead before finding out if anyone else was willing to do the work.  Not only that, but she opened up with an 83 first quarter when she was looking for 86-87 pace.  She continued to lead through a 5:39 and 5:43 first two miles as she settled into 86 pace.  The eventual winner, Cassandra Gill '17of Iona (Division I) took the lead, but sped up to 84 pace, which gapped Gong, who was not capable of holding that pace after bearing the brunt of the wind through the first two miles.  Gong continued to battle the wind with machine-like efficiency, running splits of 5:45, 5:47, 5:48 and 5:46.  During the entire fifth and sixth mile Emma Zehner '17 of Williams was closing the gap on Gong.  In the final lap it looked as though she would overtake Gong, but Gong managed a 79 last lap to hold her off and finish in 35:47.93 for second place.  While this was not a personal best, it was certainly the best race of Gong's career.
    
    
                  
    
    The men's 10K not only had the 3K and 5K indoor national champions, Peter Hale '17 of Williams and Tim Nichols '17 of Tufts respectively, but also a rabbit setting a vicious pace at 71 seconds per 400. Within the first mile, it was clear that Nichols was the only one capable of going with the rabbit's pace.  The chase pack settled in at 72-73 pace and hit splits of 4:53, 4:49, and 4:48 through three miles.  At this point, Dennis Maloney '19 and Matt Deyo 'G were with two others, one of them being Hale, who was setting the pace.  The 5K for Maloney was 15:04 and Deyo was 15:06 as he began to give in to GI issues he had been experiencing since his warm-up.  Maloney ran 4:49 for mile four and Deyo 4:55.  Deyo did not realize he had about a 15 second buffer on a national qualifying time and gave in to the pain, not finishing the race after a 75 quarter.  Maloney stayed in the three man chase group until Hale made a move with four laps to go, running 4:50 for the fifth mile.  Maloney was again reluctant to make a move before he was comfortable doing so, which meant he was not going to catch Hale.  Nevertheless, he ran 4:49 for the sixth mile and closed with a 68 final 400 to ran 30:07.93 to finish fourth and the highest placing non-senior.  This is also the third fastest time in MIT history.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, the trio will join their teammates in a good old-fashioned dual meet with Williams College.

    ### Distance Runners and Throwers Raise Their Game
    
    
                      
    
    ###### Return of Injured Athletes Give Tech Hope For Championship Season
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 22, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    After two scoring meets the MIT Engineers appreciated the opportunity to compete in the Sean Collier Invitational, a non-scoring meet.  This would permit those who needed a break the opportunity to rest prior to the championship season that begins on April 29th at home with the NEWMAC Championship.  While many would rest, many others took the opportunity to compete in order to improve performances that would allow them to compete deeper into the championship season, thus giving their team a better chance of winning those championships.
    
    
                  
    
    While most of the women's distance crew rested, Leandra Zimmermann '19 competed in her first meet of the season.  Zimmermann led the 5K from start to finish, running an excellent 18:05.28 to easily win the event and qualify for the New England Division III Championship.  Many of the men still needed qualifying times in the 5K for the New England Division III Championship and the 50 degree temperature with little to no wind provided a great opportunity.  The plan was to run 73-74 second pace and work with each other, and this they did very well.  The group split 4:54 at the 1600 and 9:49 for 3200 meters, taking turns setting the pace.  Josh Derrick '20, Daniel Weiss '19, Steven Goldy '20, Alex Knoedler '18, and Cooper Sloan '18 were working well together through this point in the race.  Sloan began to struggle in the last third of the race, but was desperately trying to hold on.  The remaining foursome continued to another 4:56 1600 for a 14:45 4800.  With an accompanying runner going for the win, Derrick decided he did not want to lose the race after all the work put in, and accepted the challenge.  Derrick won the race in 15:15.15, a 30 second final 200.  Weiss (15:20.28), Goldy (15:21.24), and Knoedler (15:23.71) decided to stick to the plan and save their energy for next week.  Sloan held 1:47 pace for the final 600, but missed the qualifying mark by 2.25 seconds, running 15:32.25.
    
    
                  
    
    Earlier in the day Aidan Gilson '19 ran a personal best in the 3000 Steeplechase, posting a 9:21.28 while running the most casual race possible.  Gilson jogged along behind the leader for 2000 meters before taking the lead as the pace had slowed to 78 second pace.  Gilson picked the pace up and then finished with a 35 final 200 to easily secure the victory.  Displaying further hurdling prowess, the sophomore ran his first ever 400IH later in the day, placing third with a time of 58.59.
    
    
                  
    
    In the throws, Ariela Slutsky '18 had another one of career days.  The junior began with a victory in the Discus, throwing a personal best of 149-6 1/4.  This mark puts Slutsky in seventh on the NCAA Division III list.  She then went to the Shot Put where she proceeded to place second with a fine throw of 40-08 3/4.  If she can keep her speed across the circle she will add many feet to that mark.  Her day not done, she took on the Hammer Throw, again winning with a personal best.  Her throw of 171-6 1/2 moves her to 12th on the NCAA list, two spots below teammate Jackie Vahey '17.
    
    
                  
    
    Cody Bratten '18 had a fine competitive day by winning the Discus with a throw of 151-3 1/4 and placing second in the Shot Put at 44-5 3/4.  However, Jon Fakkema '19 threw the big personal best, placing second in the Hammer with a 161-2 1/4 effort.
    
    
                  
    
    Other Tech winners on the men's side included Scott Cameron '19, clearing a PR of 15-7 3/4 to take first place in the Pole Vault.  Also returning to competition after suffering a broken fibula back in January, Arinze Okeke '17 won the Triple Jump in 44-6 3/4 from a very short approach.  Tyndale Hannan '20 returned to competition after missing some time with a hamstring injury, running 1:56.32 in the 800.
    
    
                  
    
    Jen Tylock '17 joined the winner's circle as she showed she is ready for the championships.  The senior won the Pole Vault with a clear of 11-4 1/2.  Hannah Chen '18 was a double winner for MIT, taking first place honors in the 100HH (15.29) and the 400IH (1:03.30).  Neither were spectacular times, but with the weather and lack of competition, the junior performed well.  Katie Bacher '20 was the other victor, taking first place in the 800 in 2:19.62.  The freshman allowed herself to be boxed in for nearly 300 meters of a slow first 400 before breaking out to negative split, finishing with a 68 last quarter.
    
    
                  
    
    Next Saturday MIT will go for their 17th consecutive NEWMAC title for the men and ninth in a row for the women.  Despite illness and injuries the Engineers are hopeful they can persevere at home.

    ### MIT Athletes Take Advantage of Spring Trip Meets
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    March 31, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    As is the case every outdoor season, the MIT Men and Women's Track and Field teams traveled out of the snow and cold of New England in search of warm weather and great performances to begin the 2017 outdoor campaign.  Unlike recent years when MIT's cohort of sprinters, jumpers, vaulters, and throwers have traveled to Los Angeles to train at Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, this year's group traveled to San Antonio, Texas and was hosted by Head Men's and Women's Track and Field Coach Marcus Whitehead and his Trinity University teams.  The weather was outstanding for the week, hitting the mid to upper 80's every day, and afforded Tech the opportunity to compete at a high level and get the outdoor season off to a fast start.   Following a successful week of training, the entirety of the Spring Trip squad competed at the Trinity Tiger Invite hosted on Friday.  For the throwers, however, their outdoor season began on Thursday at the Texas State Bobcat Invitational, competing in the Discus for the first time outdoors.   
    
    
                  
    
    At the Bobcat Invitational, the stage was set for the throwers to begin the season with a bang and get the Tech squads rolling into the weekend.  Although the weather was perfect and the facilities and competition of mostly DI and DII athletes were fantastic, the meet officiating was far from it.  In a Discus competition that saw seven flights of competitors take seven hours to complete, the MIT throwers would have their focus tested.  That being said, they certainly stepped up to the challenge.  The women competed first and were led by senior captain Jackie Vahey.  From the third flight, Vahey '17 was able to put together a throw of 132-06, a solid opener to her outdoor season in her signature event.  After being told she did not qualify, but then realizing that they had only allowed six competitors to move on to the finals, the meet officials granted Vahey '17 the finals throws that she earned.  Although she did not throw farther, she was able to place 7th in a competitive field of athletes.  Both Ari Slutsky '18 and Felusho Jebutu '20 also competed, throwing 112-01 and 102-00, respectively.
    
    
                  
    
    On the Men's side, the trio of Albert Menio '20, Jon Fakkema '19, and Cody Bratten '18 looked to keep the momentum going.  Menio '20 and Fakkema '19 performed well, marking throws of 125-06 and 127-10, respectively, but had throws significantly farther that were not marked due to a 43.00m minimum mark standard set by the meet officials.  Highlighting the throwers' excellent start was Cody Bratten '18.  Bratten, a Discus specialist, came out firing, not only placing 5th in a talented field of competitors, but also improving his lifetime best by over a meter.  Bratten '18 unleashed a bomb of 160-08, placing him 5th all-time in MIT history and 5th in all of NCAA DIII so far this year.  His distance would have qualified him for the outdoor championships in last year's field and could quite possibly do so this season. 
    
    
                  
    
    Next up, the full compliment of MIT technical athletes looked to build off of the tremendous start engineered by the throws crew.  In what was easily the most beautiful day of the week, Tech looked to make a statement at the Trinity Tiger Invite.  Once again, the throwers took it upon themselves to lead the way.  In the first event of the day, the women's throwers took to the Hammer circle.  Captain, Jackie Vahey '17 demonstrated Tech's dominance by winning in convincing fashion.  Vahey's throw of 173-02 was a huge personal best, is currently 4th in the country, and stands as the 2nd best mark in MIT history.  In addition, Ari Slutsky '18 launched a personal best throw of 162-11, which is currently 9th in the country and 5th all-time at MIT.  In the men's hammer throw, Fakkema '19 put on a show of his own, tossing a personal best of 152-10 on his way to another Tech victory.  Menio '20 also placed 7th in the event, with a throw of 125-01.
    
    
                  
    
    In the Discus, Vahey '17 came up with another great showing, improving upon her performance from the day before by throwing 138-01 for 3rd place.  Slutsky '18 kept pace, improving her previous day's performance by over 5m, finishing 4th with a throw of 131-01.  On the men's side, Bratten '18 didn't quite have the stellar performance of a day earlier, but finished 2nd with a solid throw of 153-04, right around his personal best of a season ago.  Fakkema '19, however, made the most of his second opportunity and threw a big lifetime best of 144-08, earning him 4th place.
    
    
                  
    
    On the Long Jump runway, the jumps crew looked to keep Tech rolling.  Following up her All-America campaign from the indoor season, Nneoma Okonkwo '18 did not disappoint, dominating the field and winning the event with a leap of 19-00 ¾, giving Tech its third event win on the day.  Okonkwo's jump currently ranks her 2nd in NCAA DIII.  Jumpers Haley Strouf '18 and Natalie Alper '17 both posted strong performances as well, jumping 17-10 ¾ and 16-11 ¼, placing them 3rd and 8th respectively.  On the men's side, Tech competed without the talents of All-Americans Billy Ruschel '18 and Arinze Okeke '17, but had others step up in the process, resulting in three season's best performances.  Specifically, Jason Villanueva '18 set a new personal best leap of 20-07 ¾ on his way to an 8th place finish.
    
    
                  
    
    While the horizontal jumpers were having fun in the Trinity sand pits, the Women's Pole Vaulters owned the runway and placed 6 in the top 7 spots of the competition.  Kari Stromhaug '19 posted the best performance of the evening, vaulting 12-03 ½ on her way to victory.  Stromhaug's season opener stands as the 4th best performance in MIT history, is currently 5th in the country, and may be enough to qualify her for the outdoor championship in May.  Sophomore, Kathleen Brandes also posted a personal best performance, vaulting 11-05 ¾ on her way to 2nd place.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track, the MIT women's 4x100m relay was poised to clock a fast time in the warm San Antonio weather.  Unfortunately, the relay comprised of junior captain Hannah Chen, Michelle Menkiti '20, Gabriella Zak '20, and Nneoma Okonkwo '18, was doomed from the start.  As Chen '18 burst out of the blocks and was approaching the first baton exchange, Menkiti '20 left much too early as she mistakenly was watching Trinity University's first leg enter the exchange zone.  As a result, Chen was unable to pass the baton within the exchange zone, disqualifying the Tech relay team.  The disappointment did not last long, however, as Chen '18 quickly turned things around with her 100m hurdle performance.  With a 2.1 m/s tailwind, Chen paced the field posting a personal best time of 15.01, .02 seconds faster than her previous best of a year ago.  
    
                    Back to the throws circle, MIT's throwers looked to wrap up an incredible weekend with a competitive showing in the Shot Put.  Ari Slutsky '18 led the way for the women's squad, posting a season's best throw of 40-07 ½, good enough for a 2nd place finish.  On the men's side, junior Cody Bratten continued his stellar weekend by posting yet another personal best, taking 2nd place in the process with a toss of 48-07 ½, which is currently 7th all-time at MIT.  Fakkema '19 and Menio '20, once again performed well, throwing 44-04 ¾ and 40-00 1/2, respectively.  Dana Balek '18 rounded out the throws performances, competing well in the women's javelin, throwing a solid 105-04 for 3rd place.
    
    
                  
    
    Meanwhile, on the track, Tech's sprinters took to the starting blocks.  In the women's 400m race, Gabriella Zak '20 got out to a fast start in the first 200m and although she struggled to hang on in the last 100m, posted a solid outdoor season opener of 60.36 for 3rd place.  In the men's race, senior Danny Newman began his final outdoor campaign clocking a 51.45 and taking 7th place in the process.  In the 100m, junior Nneoma Okonkwo and freshman Michelle Menkiti battled poor starts to post times of 12.63 and 12.65, placing them 3rd and 5th, respectively.  In what was the highlight of the evening on the track for MIT, Hannah Chen '18 and Gabriella Zak '20 tested their mettle in the 400m hurdles.  In her collegiate debut, Zak '20 got out well in the first 200m, but once again struggled to maintain pace in the second half of the race, ultimately finishing 3rd in a time of 65.58.  Chen '18, a two-time All-American in the event, ran an incredibly well-paced race, hitting her hurdles in stride and easily cruising in for her second victory of the evening in a time of 61.19.  Chen's performance was almost 4 seconds faster than the 2nd place finisher and currently places her atop the NCAA DIII list.  To finish up the day on the track, Michelle Menkiti '20 blazed a 25.48 in the women's 200m for 3rd place and a performance that is now 5th all-time in MIT history.  Menkiti's time is now just .16 off the MIT freshman record held by multiple-time All-American, Portia Jones.
    
    
                  
    
    Back in the sand, Tech's horizontal jumpers looked to make a statement in the Triple Jump.  In the women's competition, Jasmine Jin '20 looked to make a breakthrough and build off her strong freshman indoor season.  Battling fouling issues early on which saw two 37-38' jumps erased from her series, Jin's performance was promising yet disappointing as she was only able to manage a jump of 35-06 for 5th place. On the men's side, Tech's top performer Jason Villanueva '18 built off of his earlier personal best in Long Jump with a huge leap and personal best of 46-06 in the Triple Jump.  In addition, junior captain Ryan Prinster, who was returning from a hamstring injury, launched a solid short-approach performance of 44-02 for 4th place.  
    
    
                  
    
    In the vertical jumps, men's Pole Vault proved to be a bittersweet affair.  Following disappointing no-height performances from Scott Cameron '19 and Raja Rajcic '20, Bobby Upton '20 stepped up his performance to an unprecedented level for a freshman vaulter.  Upton '20 proved to be too much for the rest of the field as he vaulted to victory with a height of 15-09 ¾, shattering the MIT freshman record formerly held by Pole Vault standout, Nate Ball.  Upton went on to attempt 16-01 ¾, a height that would likely qualify him for the outdoor championships in May, but narrowly brushed the bar with his chest on his final attempt.  In the women's High Jump, senior captain Natalie Alper dominated the field on her way to another Tech event victory.  Alper '17 cleared both 5-01 and 5-03 on her first attempt, which proved enough for the win.  Alper then attempted 5-5 ¼, clearing it on her second attempt and establishing a new outdoor personal best and MIT school record in the process.  Alper then took solid attempts at 5-07, a national qualifying height, but was unable to clear.  In Tech's final event of the evening, men's High Jump, freshman Chris Washington displayed true competitiveness and would not be denied the top spot.  After clearing 6-00, 6-02, and 6-04, Washington '20 found himself on his final attempt at 6-06.  After two other competitors failed on their final attempt, Washington stepped up to his starting mark, approached the bar with confidence, and sailed over the bar with ease for Tech's 10th and final event victory of the evening.  Washington finished his evening by brushing the bar with his left arm and narrowly missing 6-09 ½, a height that would likely qualify him for the NCAA outdoor championship.
    
    
                  
    
    In summary, this year's Spring Trip resulted in numerous personal and season's bests, 5 performances that are likely to qualify for the NCAA Outdoor Championships, an MIT school record, and an MIT freshman record.  Next up, the Engineers of MIT will battle against the likes of Bates, Tufts and RPI in a scored quadrangular meet.  Weather permitting; Bates College will host the competition in Lewiston, ME, which will be held on April 7th and 8th.

    ### Four Freshman Records Cannot Prevent Loss to Williams
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                    
                  
                  
                  
    
    April 15, 2017
    
    
                  
    
    Dual meets in collegiate track and field are a rare occurrence these days as most programs have lost sight of wins and losses, preferring to focus on small portions of their teams, getting those individuals to the respective terminal championship of the season.  In order to get their athletes to their ultimate championship, generally the NCAA Championship, coaches feel they have to play the game of chasing performances by taking their athletes to the meets with the best competition.  There lies the key word, competition.  When two teams both want to win, particularly when those teams are rivals, and every member on those teams will do whatever it takes to score a point or cheer a teammate on to score a point, great performances happen because of that desire to win the meet.
    
    
                  
    
    Despite missing a couple of key team members on the women's side (Maryann Gong '17, Bailey Tregoning '19), and more than a few on the men's side, MIT did not appear to have a good chance to win either meet against Williams Collge.  However, great performances did happen and a very impressive team effort ensued.
    
    
                  
    
    Scoring in a dual meet goes through four places, 5-3-2-1.  While relays are supposed to be scored 5-3, the head coaches of both programs agreed to score them 5-0 so not team gets points for a potential walk-through.  The men started with a nice come from behind victory as Jon Fakkema '19 threw a personal best of 156-11 in the Hammer Throw on his final throw.  Chris Washington '20 cleared 6-6 in the High Jump, but lost on misses. Washington also came through with a personal best in the Long Jump, jumping 21-1 1/2, but that was only good for third place.  Arinze Okeke '17, MIT's All America jumper is expected to start competing next week as he comes back from a broken fibula back in January, hopefully adding some strength to the horizontal jumps.
    
    
                  
    
    On the track things started going Tech's way.  Ben Freed '18 took the lead in the Steeplechase after the first 400 despite the 72 second pace and never looked back, cruising to victory in 9:30.04. Rookie Brian Bates lost focus in the middle of the race and looked to be losing second place.  However, if Bates is within striking difference with 400 to go, he finds the necessary focus to make a race of it.  Fortunately his hurdle ability allows him to kick like that and the freshman made up a huge amount of time with a 30 second final 200 to take second 9:40.87 to 9:40.92.  That will to fight inspired his teammates.  In the 4x100 Relay, Danny Newman '17, Michael Amoako '19, and Henry Tareque '17 got the baton to  Tre Albritten '18, the two time All-America winner in the 200, who was making his competitive debut after injuring his hamstring in mid-February.  Although getting the baton a few meters behind, it took Albritten less than half the straight to rectify the situation and sprint home with the victory in 43.11.
    
    
                  
    
    The next event, the 1500 looked to be a strong one for the Ephs, but Matt Deyo '1G, fresh off his 10K attempt last week, showed his will to win.  Coming off a 3:09 1200 pace, Deyo demonstrated some wheels as he went to the lead breaking up the front pack of Williams' runners.  Although he was unable to hold onto the victory, his 3:55.46 was a significant personal best and earned his team second place, supported by Aidan Gilson's fourth place in 3:58.42.
    
    
                  
    
    Although Chris Sweeney '18 was returning to compete for the first time since tweaking his hamstring at the end of the indoor season, he was not ready for any short sprints or the high hurdles.  Luke Gray '18, primarily a decathlete, stepped up and took the victory in the 110HH with his 17.32. 
    
    
                  
    
    Back in the field events, Bobby Upton '20 and Scott Cameron '19 went 1-2 respectively in the Pole Vault to help MIT stay close to their counterpart.  The horizontal jumpers reversed the results of the Long Jump, taking the Triple Jump 1-2-4 for a 9-2 edge in that event.  Cody Bratten '18 led a 1-3-4 finish in the Discus Throw with his 157-0 winning throw.  Unfortunately the Shot Put did not go the way the Engineers hoped, and Williams earned the 8-3 point result.
    
    
                  
    
    The 400 Meter Dash was another turning point in favor of the Engineers.  Tom Frejowski '19 and Michael Amoako  ran huge races to place first and second respectively, upsetting the Ephs.  Frejowski ran 49.99 and Amoako 50.14. Newman, normally a 400 runner, raced the 100 since Albritten was not yet ready to come out of starting blocks.  Newman got the job done, sprinting to an 11.27 victory.
    
    
                  
    
    At this point, MIT was up 77 to 64.  The 800 did a lot to even things up for Williams.  Missing all but one of their top 800 runners, MIT simply got spanked.  Williams swept the top five places, winning the event in 1:53.25.  This put the score at MIT 77, Williams 75.
    
    
                  
    
    Sweeney made his outdoor season debut in the 400IH and did not disappoint.  He led gun to finish, winning in 56.65. Williams took second and third to make the event a wash.  Tech stepped up big in the 200 as Newman led a 1-2-4 finish with Amoako claiming second and Acquah fourth.  Newman's winning time was 21.99.  Now the score was  MIT 91, Williams 82 with just the 5K, 4x400 and 4x800 to go. Going into the 5K, MIT needed six of the 11 points to seal at least a tie and three to set up needing only one of the two relays to win the meet.  Having their two best distance runners, Deyo and Dennis Maloney '19 in the 1500 to protect their bodies after their 10K the weekend before, Tech was depending on their second tier runners, runners who were very motivated to get the job done.
    
    
                  
    
    The pace was quick, led by the Williams' runners coming through the 1600 at 4:52.  MIT still had three runners in contention and things were looking good.  After 3200 meters it was clear Williams was going to win the event, but it also appeared MIT would get the next three places.  However, that 4:52 first mile began to have its effect and the pace slowed.  The second 1600 was 5:02, and although the Engineers held onto the pace, Williams had a runner making a ferocious charge to score.  In the end, Williams was successful in placing first and second, but MIT secured the three points necessary to mean they only needed to win one of the two relays.  Billy Woltz '20 place third in his 5K debut, running 15:29.57 and Steven Goldy '20 earned fourth in 15:30.19.
    
    
                  
    
    After their performance in the 400 and 200 it appeared the Engineers would be able to take the 4x400 and secure the win, but Williams was very motivated.  Amoako was suffering from a heal injury and did not feel he could go so Ken Acquah '20 would replace him.  Brandon Corts '17 led off and delivered a solid 51.6 to put MIT slightly in the lead.  Frejowski left a little early and had to slow to receive the baton, but stayed even with Williams with his 50.9.  Acquah ran an outstanding leg, although he too left early and had to slow down.  He did not give up despite being passed in the second turn, finishing just behind Williams in 51.2.  Newman also left early, quickly falling behind by over five meters.  Newman's mistake was thinking he could catch his opponent in the final straight, but the Williams runner had the same plan and had too much left, securing the victory 3:22.65 to 3:23.18.
    
    
                  
    
    After getting swept in the 800, it appeared unlikely MIT would be able to win the 4x800.  Bates led off, but struggled mightily in the second lap, producing a 2:07 leadoff.  Although Deyo ran 1:59.0, Gilson 1:57.6 and Nathan Munet '19 a 1:59.3, MIT could not make up the early gap, losing the event and the meet 100 to 94.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's meet had a similar pattern.  Led by their outstanding throwers, Jackie Vahey '17 and Ariela Slutsky '18, MIT stayed ahead in the field events, as the duo placed first and second in the Hammer, Discus and Shot Put.  Slutsky won both the Shot Put (38-7 1/2) and the Hammer (PR of 163-5) while Vahey took the Discus in 139-6.  Vahey even joined Dana Balek '18 and Elise McCormack-Kuhman in the Javelin to secure a fourth place.  Balek won easily with a PR of 123-5.
    
    
                  
    
    Although Kari Stromhaug '19 was sitting out the Pole Vault due to a sore back and Kaitlyn Sparks '20 no-heighted, Kathleen Brandes '19 led Makenzie Patarino '19 and Jen Tylock '17 to a 1-2-tie for 3rd finish, winning in 11-7 3/4.  The jumps did not quite go the way of the Engineers.  Williams swept the Triple Jump despite Jasmine Jin '20 jumping a PR of 35-8 1/2.  Williams' three All America high jumpers did their job, relegating Natalie Alper '17 to a fourth place finish.  Although Nneoma Okonkwo '18 was able to win the Long Jump at 18-11 1/4, Williams put two athletes ahead of Haley Strouf '18, to secure second and third.  MIT took the field events 50.5 to 26.5.
    
    
                  
    
    However, Williams strength was in the running events, and when not at full strength that did not go in Tech's favor.  Jenna Melanson '20 did her part, taking the lead early in the Steeplechase and disregarding everyone to win in 11:06.25, an MIT freshman record.  Megan McCandless '20 continues her comeback from plantar fasciitis, running the steeple for the first time.  Despite awful waterjump efforts due to substantial deceleration going into the barrier, she still placed third in 11:20.64.
    
    
                  
    
    The quartet of Hannah Chen '18, Michelle Menkiti '20, Jane Reed '20 and Okonkwo delivered a huge blow to the favored Williams 4x100 unit.  Although the first handoff was a big reach by Chen as Menkiti left a little early, the foursome ran a 47.76 to win in an impressive time.
    
    
                  
    
    In the 1500, where Williams was heavily favored with the last minute scratch of Gong, went as expected.  After a slow start (80), the pace picked up in the third lap as both Clemmie Mitchell '18 and Katie Bacher '20 came through in 3:52 after a 73 lap.  The top two Williams' runners had more speed and sprinted away from Mitchell (4:46.79) and Bacher (4:48.90), who had to settle for third and fourth.
    
    
                  
    
    Chen won the high hurdles in 15.11, Reed claimed second in a PR of 58.62 in the 400 and Chen returned along with Gabriella Zak '20 to place 1-4 in the 400IH.  Chen, the third ranked intermediate hurdler in all of Division III won the event in 61.53.  Zak went out too fast, has not yet learned to use her other lead leg and struggled home in 66.98.
    
    
                  
    
    Menkiti had quite the day.  In addition to her role in the 4x100, she placed second the 100 in 12.40, breaking her own freshman record in the event and took third in the 200 in 25.12, another freshman record.  The problem with the 200 was that Williams placed first, second and fourth to close the gap on MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    Just prior to the 200 Marissa McPhillips ran an outstanding race, defeating many top Williams 800 runners with her 2:17.24 performance.  So, going into the 5K, MIT was up 91.5 to 88.5 for Williams.  Williams had two runners who had qualified for Nationals in the 10K the week before, was heavily favored to place take first, second and third as their third runner was a national caliber miler.  Mary Eccles '18 was determined not to let that happen.  The initial pace was 5:48 for the 1600, which was not particularly fast, but not that slow either.  The second mile pace picked up to a 5:37, but Eccles stayed right with the leaders.  However, the third Williams' runner fell off the pace.  Now the question was whether Eccles could break up the top two.  After taking the lead with 900 meters to go with 83 second quarters, the Williams duo took off in the final 400 to easily go 1-2.  Eccles ran an outdoor PR of 17:41.93.
    
    
                  
    
    Going into the relays, MIT needed to win both to win the meet.  While this again seemed unlikely, no one quit.  In the 4x400, Reed led off with a 59.9 to hold a slight lead.  Alper ran 59.8 to stay even and Zak ran 59.4 to bring the baton to Chen just five meters back.  Chen produced her fourth outstanding performance of the day, touring the oval in 56.8 to win the event in 3:55.90.
    
    
                  
    
    Just like the men, the 4x800 would decide the meet.  MIT simply did not have the legs, but they did have the heart.  Margaret Trautner '20 led off with a 2:27, but similar to the men, that put MIT six seconds in arrears.  Bacher, already pretty gassed, ran a gutsy 2:22.3.  Melanson was totally out of her element, but ran 2:24.6 anyway.  McPhillips came back and finished in 2:19.7, but could not make up the difference.  Williams ran 9:18.91 while MIT finished in 9:33.66 to lose the relay and the meet.  The one bright spot was that the performance was another MIT freshman record.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT will host the Sean Collier Invitational, a non-scoring meet, and therefore will send a handful of runners to Princeton for the Larry Ellis Invitational.
