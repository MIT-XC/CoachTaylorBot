                  <h3>Steeplers Breakthrough for MIT at All New England Championship</h3>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                </center>
              
              
              <p>May 12-13, 2017</p>
              <p>After the past two weeks of team championships, a toll had been taken on the mental side of the MIT Track &amp; Field team.&nbsp; At least that is how it appeared on day one of the <a href="neicaaa.res.php">NEICAAA Championship</a>, a championship that brings together all Division I, II, and III colleges in New England.&nbsp; With the distance runners and some jumpers resting this weekend, and the team not going for points, but only trying to improve performances for the NCAA Division III Championship in two weeks, the athletes seemed flat.&nbsp; They competed well relative to the competition, but the energy just did&nbsp;not seem to be there, not for MIT and not for anyone else either, at least for day one of the championship.</p>
              <p>Nneoma Okonkwo '18 and Haley Strouf '18 got things started in the Long Jump.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both jumpers made it to the finals, but they were not jumping near their best.&nbsp; In the final, both improved, moving up to first and fourth respectively, excellent places for the duo.&nbsp; Okonkwo jumped 18-6 1/2 for the victory and Strouf jumped 18-1 1/2.</p>
              <p>At the same time Jackie Vahey '17 and Ariela Slutsky '18 were representing the Engineers in the Hammer Throw.&nbsp; Both performed well, placing seventh and eighth with Vahey throwing 170-3 and Slutsky 170-0.&nbsp; Still the energy was just not there.</p>
              <p>In the Pole Vault, the four entries from MIT again competed well, but no where near what they did the week before when the team counted on them.&nbsp; Kari Stromhaug '19 placed fourth, clearing 12-1 1/2.&nbsp; Kathleen Brandes '19 was seventh at 11-7 3/4.&nbsp; Jen Tylock '17 and McKenzie Patarino '19 both cleared 11-1 3/4 but did not place.</p>
              <p>Natalie Alper '17 jumped very well in the High Jump, placing sixth at 5-5.&nbsp; Also doing well as things got started on the track was Hannah Chen '18.&nbsp; Chen first ran 14.58 in the 100HH prelims, not her best time ever, but probably her fastest non wind-aided performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;This got her into the finals the next day.&nbsp; A little later Chen came back in the 400IH&nbsp;trials, placing second overall and winning her heat in 61.64.</p>
              <p>Others were not so fortunate in the trials of the running events.&nbsp; Michelle Menkiti '20 ran 12.36 in the 100 trials and 25.21 in the 200 trials, neither time quite good enough to make the finals.&nbsp; On the men's side Danny Newman '17 ran 22.01 in the 200, Henry Tareque '17 50.89 in the 400 and Chris Sweeney '18 56.20 in the 400IH, none of them matching the performances from the week before or making it to the finals.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The only field event on day one for the men was the Pole Vault.&nbsp; Scott Cameron '19&nbsp;injured his hamstring in winning the Pole Vault the week before, ending his season.&nbsp; Bobby Upton '20 vaulted, but not his best, only clearing 14-5 1/4.</p>
              <p>Day two needed to be better.&nbsp; Things got going with the Men's Discus.&nbsp; The results made everyone wonder if the Tech athletes could muster anything that would resemble a personal best.&nbsp; Cody Bratten '18, like most of this teammates competed well, but also seemed flat.&nbsp; He placed eighth with a throw of 150-9.&nbsp; Jon Fakkema '19 threw 141-5.</p>
              <p>On the track the women's 4x100 Relay was the first event.&nbsp; Chen got out well and the handoff to Menkiti was also successful.&nbsp; However, there was a hitch with the handoff to Jane Reed '20, causing Reed to slow as she neared the end of the zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next handoff to Okonkwo was a little early in the zone due to a coach's error, causing the baton to slow through the zone.&nbsp; The overall time of 48.85 was definitely off their best.</p>
              <p>The 1500 was next and Colin Godwin '17 got things going.&nbsp; The injury plagued senior was making the best of his final season, taking matters into his own hands when necessary.&nbsp; Since he missed the first half of the season he had to race out of the slow section the week before and this weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a 62.0 first quarter and a 2:05.0 half, Godwin took the lead, picking up the pace significantly&nbsp;and never taking his foot off the gas.&nbsp; The next quarter was a 61 and he then finished with a 45 final 300 for a 3:52.36 victory&nbsp;and personal best.&nbsp; The fast section only produced two times faster than Godwin's, giving the senior third place overall.&nbsp; Godwin provided the spark needed for a turn-a-round.</p>
              <p>The women were&nbsp;next&nbsp;and MIT had Katie Bacher '20, Marissa McPhillips '20 and Maryann Gong '17 all hoping to produce national qualifying performances.&nbsp; Bacher and McPhillips were in the second of three sections&nbsp;while Gong was in the fast section.&nbsp; The pace for the second section was crisp at the 400&nbsp;with Bacher towards the front in 71 and McPhillips in the back at 73.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the leaders slowed the pace and things bunched up.&nbsp; The split at the 800 was 2:27, so Bacher and McPhillips started moving towards the front.&nbsp; Entering the final lap the two were in the lead, splitting 3:41 and continuing on to finish 1-2 in their section with respective times of 4:34.70 and 4:35.69, a new PR for McPhillips.&nbsp; Gong is still trying to find where she is mentally and it showed in the second half of her race.&nbsp; After coming through the 800 in 2:22 and looking strong, she suddenly fell apart, finishing in 4:38.53.</p>
              <p>Back to the field events, Bratten doubled back in the Shot Put, but could not find success there either, putting the shot 45-1 1/2.&nbsp; In the Women's Discus, number one seed Slutsky, was leading going into the finals with a fine throw of 147-8, a mark that appeared to be farther, but was possibly mis-marked.&nbsp; In the final another thrower passed her by eight centimeters, giving Slutsky second place.&nbsp; Vahey earned eighth with a throw of 130-5.</p>
              <p>The final events for MIT were the men's and women's 3000 Meter Steeplechase.&nbsp; In the men's fast section, Aidan Gilson '19 and Ben Freed '18 were hoping to put a great race together and reach a sub 9:12, a mark that generally would make the&nbsp;national&nbsp;championship field.&nbsp; Luke O'Connor '17 of Tufts, the top seed in the country for DIII at 8:58, took the pace out hard in 2:16 at the half.&nbsp; Gilson made the pre-race decision to go with him and hung on well, looking very comfortable.&nbsp; Freed led the chase group at 2:20.&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Connor slowed the pace to 74-75 for the next three laps before picking up the pace.&nbsp; Gilson stayed on pace with a 4:46 1600 with Freed doing the same at 4:50.&nbsp; In the final 1000 meters, Gilson fell away from O'Connor, but stayed solid at 74-75 pace and even picked it up for a 36 final 200, running a huge PR of 9:05.61, the sixth fastest time in DIII.&nbsp; Freed, slowed to 76 and then 77 in the final two laps, but closed in 35 for a 9:13.78, a PR that currently puts him 21st on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p>Jenna Melanson '20, already 10th on the national list, was hoping to have a race where she did not lose focus in the latter stages, thus running closer to her potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;The field was loaded with outstanding Division I talent, but all were much faster than Melanson.&nbsp; Running towards the back of the pack she still came through a frighteningly fast 80 first quarter.&nbsp; As she settled in, the pace slowed but gradually.&nbsp; The planned pace was 86, which she did not hit until the third quarter.&nbsp; The 1600 split was a crisp 5:36 as the freshman moved into fifth place  and was moving up on fourth.&nbsp; Averaging 88 for the next three laps while she was in limbo with no one immediately in&nbsp;front of her, Melanson sped up at the end to finish in fourth in a new personal best of 10:43.41, the third time she has set the MIT freshman record.&nbsp; This mark places Melanson fifth on the NCAA Division III list.</p>
              <p>With five days remaining to qualify for Nationals, there will be a series of Final Qualifying meets around the country, one of which will be hosted by MIT, next Thursday evening.&nbsp; The Engineers hope to get a few more on the list for the trip to Ohio.</p>
