ECAC MEET</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Amid final projects, final classes and preparing for final exams,
MIT Men's Track team sent a contingent of their provisional national
qualifiers to Springfield College to participate in the ECAC Division
III Championship. Although none of the Tech competitors improved
their marks, all but one placed and competed well, giving the team a
4th place finish with just 7 competitors.</P>

<P>For all practical purposes, with the exception of a couple of
schools, the ECAC Division III Championship is just a last chance
qualifier for the NCAA Division III Championship. Nearly all
colleges, with the exception of MIT and a couple of others, are
finished with the exams, and are probably not going to house students
and send them to the meet just for the sake of placing in the
meet.</P>

<P>First up for MIT was the Pole Vault. Nathan Ball was looking to
improve on his freshman record vault of 15-7 1/4 and make his
qualification for nationals automatic. Nate started at 14-3 and had
no misses through 15-3. Two of his vaults at 15-9 were over the bar
but due to his not shooting straight up the pole, he knocked the bar
off with his chest on the way over. Although he was leading up
through 15-3, the winner eventually cleared 16-0 to pass Nate.</P>

<P>In the Hammer Throw, Chis Khan elected to bow out to focus on the
Discus. Marios Michalakis and Greg Walker competed to try and improve
on their best marks of the year. Marios had trouble staying in the
circle in the finals after leading the trials with a 173-3 effort.
Marios did not improve on his trials mark and finished in 2nd place.
Greg was not able to handle the final week shift from two turns to a
toe turn and two turns with the hope of gaining the necessary speed
to throw 10 feet farther and finished with a 159-4 throw.</P>

<P>On day two, the High Jump led things off. Craig Mielcarz stayed
home to practice feeling his 6-10 1/4 mark would get him in the NCAA
meet. Brian Hoying needed to improve on his 6-8 mark. After
struggling through 6-7, Brian had two great attempts at 6-9 1/2 but
did not make it. Coming into outdoor track after spraining his ankle
during basketball season did not give him enough time to get ready
for the NCAA Championship.</P>

<P>Ben Schmeckpeper needed to give it one more try in the 3000
steeplechase. Realizing he was the top seed and deciding to take the
lead to make things happen, Ben uncharacteristically shouldered much
of the burden and he paid for it. Ben struggled after the mile mark
and could only manage a 9:32.85 for 5th place.</P>

<P>Sean Nolan rested on his 5000 time and worked on speed in the
1500, joining Brian Anderson who wanted to improve his mark and
racing comfort. A slow pace worked against both runners. Sean held on
to 3rd place but only managed a 4:01.06 time. Brian paid for a
difficult academic week and struggled to a 4:06.35.</P>

<P>Chris Khan finished the competition for MIT with the Discus throw.
Chris had some good warmups, showing the 170 mark is quite possible.
However, in the competition he could not finish his good throws
without fouling and ended up in 5th with 148-5.</P>

<P>The athletes will wait and see who gets in to the NCAA meet and
perhaps get one more opportunity to improve their marks and become
All America honorees. The NCAA Championship will be held at
Macalaster College in Minneapolis May 23-25.</P>
