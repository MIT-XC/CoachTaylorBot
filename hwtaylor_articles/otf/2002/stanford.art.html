PROVISIONAL QUALIFYING MARKS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>March 29-30, 2002</P>

<P>The MIT Men's Track and Field team ended a warm and sunny week in
Palo Alto, California on the campus of Stanford University at the
annual Stanford Invitational. This meet is considered the kickoff to
the Outdoor Track seaon for NCAA Division I schools as well as open
athletes competing after their collegiate careers. The overwhelming
competition did not seem to bother the Engineers, indeed it seemed to
inspire some remarkable performances given how hard the team worked
during the week leading up to the meet.</P>

<P>While the hard workouts and the week of 80 degree temperatures
seemed to leave the representatives from Cambridge, Massachusetts
tired, the competition seemed to bring out the best in them. Leading
the way with a tie for 5th was Craig Mielcarz with a national
qualifying jump of 6-8 in the high jump. Also qualifying
provisionally for the NCAA Championship were Chris Khan in the Hammer
with a throw of 168-11 and Sean Nolan in the 5000 with a time of
14:47.22.</P>

<P>Numerous personal bests and New England Division III qualifying
performances were also achieved on the Stanford track and field.
Craig Wildman ran a terrific race in the 3000 Steeplechase, running
9:48.17 for both a PR and a qualifying mark. Craig Mielcarz also had
a good long jump effort of 20-11 1/4. Victor Williamson leaped 43-4
1/4 in the Triple Jump for a PR and was closely followed by Austin
Neudecker with a 43-3 3/4 effort. Nate Ball started the outdoor
season off well with a vault of 14-9. In the other running events,
Mark Jeunnette seemed to run everything well. Mark began with an
intermediate hurdle race in 58.02 and shortly afterwards won his
section of the 800 with a 1:55.31 performance. The next day, Mark
anchored the 1600 relay consisting of Yuval Mazor, Alan Raphael and
Gabe Sanchez to an overall time of 3:24.63 with his 50.3 leg. Running
the fastest MIT time since 2000, the 400 relay team of Zach Traina,
Rick Rajter, Yuval Mazor and Marc Washington ran 43.63 despite two
poor handoffs.</P>

<P>Other good performaces were supplied by; Junius Ho, who jumped
20-5 1/4 in the long jump and ran 15.86 in the 110 High Hurdles, Rick
Rajter and Peter Bluvas, running 15.59 and 15.81 respectively in the
110 HH, Brian Anderson running 4:00.66 in the 1500, Matt Lehman and
Yuval Mazor running 50.42 and 50.80 respectively in the 400 and Zach
Traina running 22.85 and 11.33 in the 200 and 100 respectively.</P>

<P>Next Saturday, the annual Engineers Cup will be hosted by WPI as
MIT tries to avenge their loss to RPI last year, when numerous
athletes were out with injuries and illnesses.</P>
