WINNERS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>May 23-25, 2002</P>

<P>Even though nine different athletes on the MIT Men's Track and
Field team qualified provisionally, only four actually were accepted
into the NCAA Championship field. Of the four, only one was favored
to score, but two came through, scoring 5 total points and finishing
in a tie for 47th place.</P>

<P>As usual, the MIT team was more of a dual meet team, as indicated
by their 7th national ranking in the power rankings, which give a
cumulative score based on the top two performers per event. The young
team, no seniors among the nine provisional qualifiers, was
successful to a point, but not quite good enough to make a strong
showing at the NCAA Championship.</P>

<P>Craig Mielcarz, for the second year in succession, led the team
with the top score, a fifth place in the High Jump. Craig made first
attempts at 6'5, 6'7 and 6'9 to put himself in a strong position to
repeat his 2nd place performance from 2001. However, even though his
final two attempts were excellent and near clearances, he failed to
clear 6'11. Four made 6'11 and two of them made 7'1 to highlight the
quality of Division III.</P>

<P>Chris Khan, qualified in both the Hammer and Discus, competed in
the Hammer first. He was seeded fourth entering the competition with
a throw of 180'. In the trials he was only able to get off a throw of
172-7 to enter the finals in 8th position. He improved his mark to
176, which temporarily moved him into 7th, but was passed back to end
up in 8th. In the Discus, Chris was not able to throw beyond 154-5 in
the trials, which missed finals by one performer. His second throw, a
toe foul, would have been over 160'.</P>

<P>Brian Anderson debuted in his first individual effort at nationals
and did well to make finals with a 3:56.17. In the finals, Brian ran
well, taking the lead after 600 meters and holding it until 400 were
left, but he could not hold on and dropped to 11th as the leaders ran
57 seconds for the final 400.</P>

<P>Nathan Ball had a fantastic freshman season, but was not able to
put the icing on the cake at nationals. Opening at 14-7, a
comfortable height for him, the strong tailwind and his speed from
rested legs caused him to blow through the poles he was accustomed
to. Not feeling comfortable going to a heavier pole, he was unable to
manage the speed and failed to clear the opening height. </P>

<P>With all qualifiers returning next year, along with a couple of
very talented freshman, MIT hopes to make a stronger showing at next
year's championship at St. Lawrence University in upstate New
York.</P>
