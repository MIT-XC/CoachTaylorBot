<P>May 9-11, 2002</P>

<P>The final two weeks of classes combined with a long season
conspired to end most of MIT's track team a week early, causing them
to miss the All New England Championship. Usually a very strong meet,
equal or greater than the Division III Nationals, the meet was
weakened without the presence of UConn and the Ivy League colleges.
Even with the weaker competition, MIT was only able to place 10th
overall with 26 1/2 points. </P>

<P>Tech had two personal bests and two season bests as they prepared
for the NCAA Championship later this month. On day one, Sean Nolan
led the way with an outdoor PR of 14:41.29 as he placed 2nd. Nolan
improved his national ranking with his time and hopes it is good
enough to get him into the National Championship. Also setting a PR,
and improving his national qualifying mark, was Greg Walker who threw
the hammer 170-2. Also in the Hammer Throw, Chris Khan placed 4th
with a throw of 180-8.</P>

<P>In the High Jump, Craig Mielcarz tied for 4th with a first clear
at 6-7. Teammate Brian Hoying also made 6-7, but settled for 6th
position.</P>

<P>On the track, Brian Anderson qualified for the finals of the 1500
with a 3:55.80. The other runners were not so fortunate. Alan Raphael
ran 1:58.24 in the 800 after a slow first quarter and had to call it
quits after a very successful season. Yuval Mazor, suffering from a
cold, could not get untracked in the 400 and missed the finals. Zach
Traina ran well into the wind, but his 22.63 was not enough to
advance.</P>

<P>Day two field events began with Khan throwing the Discus. With two
of his three efforts being fouls he was unable to get one off far
enough to make the finals, missing it by one person. Freshman Nate
Ball continued his fantastic season with a 15-3 1/2 clearance, good
enough for 5th place.</P>

<P>Ben Schmeckpeper showed he is still on track to make it to
nationals in the 3000 Steeplechase by running an even split first
mile in 4:57, and finished in 7th with a PR and freshman record of
9:24.12. This also provisionally qualified Schmeckpeper for the NCAA
Championship. </P>

<P>Anderson was next on the track as he attempted to place in the
1500. He did not have the same passion as last week, letting the
competition pull away from him after the 1200 mark. Anderson finished
the final 300 in a dismal 48 seconds to fade to 9th place.</P>

<P>The final event for the Engineers was the 1600 Relay. The foursome
of Matt Lehman, Raphael, Mark Jeunnette and Mazor decided they wanted
one last opportunity to qualify for nationals, despite Lehman's
tender hamstring and Mazor's cold. Lehman led off with a fine 49.8
leg despite pulling his hamstring after the first turn. Raphael ran a
personal best 400 leg when he also brought the baton in in 49.8.
Jeunnette got out slow but nevertheless closed well with a 50.5 to
put MIT on course for a season best. Mazor pulled it together long
enough to bring the around in a 50.0 to give Tech their season best
of 3:20.22</P>

<P>Next week, MIT will take those that are provisionally qualified
for nationals to the ECAC meet to see if they can improve their marks
in their last chance opportunity. The meet will be held on Thursday
and Friday at Springfield College.</P>
