WELL WITH RECORD SETTING VICTORY IN NEWMAC
CHAMPIONSHIP</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>April 27, 2002</P>

<P>MIT set a meet record for number of points scored on Saturday when
they hosted the 4th annual NEWMAC (New England Women's and Men's
Athletic Conference) Outdoor Track and Field Championship, scoring
293 points to runnerup Springfield's 165 points. The Coast Guard
Academy followed with 111.5, Wheaton with 109, WPI with 52.5 and
Babson trailed with 36 in their second season of track and field. The
meet awarded 10 points for 1st, and 8-6-5-4-3-2-1 for 2nd through 8th
respectively. Each school was permitted up to 4 entries per
event.</P>

<P>MIT, a pre-meet favorite by over 60 points, capitalized on their
depth in the field events and quality in every event. The three main
events the Engineers were looking to dominate were the Pole Vault,
Hammer Throw and the 110 High Hurdles. Unlike most years when Tech
had a dominant force in the middle distance and distance events, the
2002 version has quality in those areas but not so much depth and is
more dependent on balance.</P>

<P>As expected, the hammer throwers came through with 25 points of a
possible 29 when they placed 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th. Of the four, only
David Saylor threw a PR when he launched one 148-8 to secure 5th
place behind the winning throw by Marios Michalakis. The vaulters did
not fall far behind the example set by the hammer throwers when they
followed Nate Ball's new freshman and meet record 15-5 1/2 vault with
3rd, 5th, 6th place finishes for 23 points. Also setting season bests
in the vault were Dan Opila with a 13-9 1/4 for 3rd and 13-3 1/4 for
Nestor Hernandez, good for 5th. The hurdlers stepped up with four
season and three personal bests. Leading the way, Rick Rajter cruised
to a 15.18 victory as he begins to round into championship form.
Peter Bluvas showed he is getting ready for next week's decathlon as
he set one of many PR's with a 4th place 15.58. Craig Mielcarz
delivered a PR of 15.52 in the trials but fell to 15.62 in the finals
for 5th place. Junius Ho blasted a 15.76 in the trials and finished
7th in the finals for a total of 21 points.</P>

<P>The other jumps also went well for MIT. The quality of the High
Jump in this conference is the best in the country with two jumpers
over 7' and two more over 6-10. Dan Olson and Raheim Greenridge of
Wheaton did their job of going 1-2 with leaps of 7-1 and 6-11
respectively. Brian Hoying and Craig Mielcarz of MIT followed in 3rd
and 4th. The Long Jump gave MIT 17 points when Mielcarz delivered a
21-6 effort for 2nd place and Ho added his 2nd season best of the day
with a 21-4 3/4 leap for 3rd. Tom Hoover, fighting injuries, was only
able to produce a 21-0 performance for 6th. Austin Neudecker garnered
2nd in the Triple Jump by leaping 43-9 1/4 behind the 49-7 1/4 effort
by Wheaton's Greenridge. Ho again came through with a career best
when he placed 6th with 41-4 1/4.</P>

<P>If the jumps went well, the throws were exceptional. Even the
traditionally low scoring Shot Put crew delivered 15 points when
Bluvas launched a PR of 43-4 3/4 to get 2nd ahead of some struggling
Springfield throwers who usually own the event. Phil Zakielarz snuck
into 3rd with a PR of 43-3 1/4. Chris Khan broke out of his techincal
slump in the Discus with a throw of 160-8 for 1st place. Greg Walker
and Peter Bluvas aslo had PRs with throws of 135-3 and 132-10, good
for 5th and 6th places. Dale Cotton showed his throw last week of
180-11 in the Javelin was no fluke when he threw 176-9 for 3rd
place.</P>

<P>Injuries and illnesses prevented Tech from filling the events in
the running arena, but what they had faired pretty well. Brian
Anderson was one of only two double event winners in the meet.
Anderson took control of both the 800 and 1500 in the latter stages,
running 1:55.96 and 3:57.73 under the very windy conditions. In the
800, Alan Raphael supported with a PR of 1:55.98 for 2nd. Sean Nolan
helped out in the 1500 with a PR of 4:00.27, good enough for 4th.</P>

<P>The distance events followed suit with Ben Schmeckpeper continuing
to knock near 10 second increments off his time each week when he ran
9:29.71 as he approached the freshman record of 9:25.68. Sean Nolan
came back very well from his 1500 and delivered a runaway victory in
the 5000 with a 14:55.82. Albert Liu supported the effort with a
season best of 15:36.66 for 6th. Liyan Guo and Greg Fonder placed 2nd
and 3rd in the 10K by running 34:19.13 and 35:20.20 respectively.</P>

<P>Zach Traina placed 2nd and 3rd in his sprint specialties with
11.12 and 22.26 times in the 100 and 200 meter dashes. Marc
Washington supported in both with a 5th in the 100 and a 4th in the
200. The 200 brought surprise results with 17 points when Rick Rajter
ran a 22.90 PR for his first effort this year and Yuval Mazor ran a
PR of 23.02, good for 5th and 7th respectively.</P>

<P>Earlier, Matt Lehman and Yuval Mazor finished 3rd and 4th in the
400 with times of 50.29 and 50.55 respectively. Gabe Sanchez offered
support by finishing in 7th. The other 400 event, the intermediate
hurdles, went very well as Mark Jeunnette ran 56.03 for 2nd and a
season best. Russ Moriarty followed in 3rd and Bluvas placed 6th in
his first effort of the year.</P>

<P>The relays brought more success for the Engineers. The 400 Relay
of Traina, Rajter, Mazor and Washington had two good handoffs en
route to a 43.29 2nd place finish. Matt Lehman led off the 1600 Relay
with a 49.5 leg to put MIT ahead for good. Jeunnette, Anderson and
Mazor finished the job in 3:22.81 for the victory.</P>

<P>The Engineers are ready, but whether or not they are ready to
finish the unfinished task of beating Williams College for the New
England Division III title, being held at Williams, remains to be
seen. The meet will start with the Decathlon on Thursday and Friday
and conclude with the remaining events on Satruday.</P>
