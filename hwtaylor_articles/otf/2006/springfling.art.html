    WIN IN SPRING FLING MEET</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">March 29, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">MIT traveled to Clermont, Florida for their spring break trip,
    looking for some good warm weather training and competition.&nbsp; After
    a couple days of good, hard workouts Tech lined up in the Spring Fling Meet
    against Colby College of Maine and Grinnell College of Iowa.&nbsp; Only having
    brought 19 of their team members there were some holes in the lineup, but
    the same was true with the opposing teams.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT claimed every running event they entered, including the
    relays, with only the 400IH being void an MIT runner.&nbsp; The only double
    winner in the running events was David Blau, running 11.1 and 22.34 to claim
    the 100 and 200 meter races with excellent early season performances.&nbsp; The
    only other double victor was Omari Stephens, who won the pole vault at 13-0
    and the 110HH in the personal best of 15.88.</p>
  <p align="left">Other victories were earned by  Alex Rothberg in the 400 in
    51.17 with a very well paced effort.&nbsp; Placing second and fourth, also
    breaking 52 seconds were Ulzie Rea and Alex Rothberg.&nbsp; In the 800, Dave
    Reshef ran from behind, nearly even-splitting a 2:01.74 victory.&nbsp; Joining
    him in third and fourth were Matt Bieniosek and Fivos Constantinou.</p>
  <p align="left">Constantinou earlier ran away with the 1500 victory, leading
    from start to finish, winning with a fine time of 4:04.97.&nbsp; Yermie Cohen
    supported with a fourth place effort.&nbsp; Chris Bruce also led from start
    to finish, running 10:12.22 in the 3000 steeplechase.&nbsp; Bruce went out
    in a very strong pace but faltered in the final two and a half laps.</p>
  <p align="left">Jake Ruzevick did not have a good day, possibly suffering from
    exhaustion, but ran to victory anyway in the 5000.&nbsp; Eric Khatchadourian
    was the only entrant in the 10K, but his 33:16.06 was nevertheless a strong
    early season performance.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT won both relays, winning the 4x100 in 43.94 with two to
    three alternate legs.&nbsp; The second handoff was the only poor one, one
    which required Thad Wozniak, the outgoing runner to slow down significantly
    at the end of the exchange zone to received the baton from Dan Rodgers.&nbsp; Blau
    and Rothberg took care of the two ends to bring Tech to victory.&nbsp; In
    the 4x400, Rothberg led off with a less than perfect 52.5 effort.&nbsp;Rodgers
    also ran slower than his open time, only clocking a 52.5 leg.&nbsp; Reshef
    ran a superb 52.3 was a personal best 400 relay leg.&nbsp; Bieniosek put
    the victory away with a 52.7 anchor.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji did not have his usual superb meet.&nbsp; All the
    field event athletes worked really hard on Monday and Tuesday, even working
    out the morning of the meet.&nbsp; The fatigue showed as the big man only
    threw 53-2 1/2 in the shot put to win.&nbsp; He was only able to claim second
    places in the discus and hammer as he just could not get anything going.&nbsp; Chris
    Bateman took the long jump with a leap of 19-8 1/2 to lead a three man sweep
    of the event.&nbsp; A notable second place effort was put in by James Oleinik
    in the shot put with a throw of 45-2 1/2.</p>
  <p align="left">On Saturday, MIT travels to Gainsville to compete against Division
    I power houses in the U. of Florida Diet Pepsi Invitational. </p>
