    TWO MEET RECORDS</span></strong></p>
  <p><strong><span class="style1">MIT Places 3rd in New England Division III
        Championship</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">May 5-6, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">MIT was seeded fourth going into the <a href="nediv3.res.html">New
      England Division III Outdoor Track and Field Championship</a> hosted by Springfield College, behind
    Williams College, Bates College and Tufts University. &nbsp; Led by two meet
    records by Uzoma Orji and the resulting 24 points in his three events, MIT
    rallied past Bates but got caught by Tufts in a series of mishaps that led
    to falling behind by 1/2 point.</p>
  <p align="left">For the first time, the men's and women's championships were
    run at the same site, meaning that some of the events other than the multi-events
    would be held on Friday.&nbsp; The first event, the long jump,&nbsp; had
    MIT seeded eighth and tenth.&nbsp; After two very average jumps, Thad Wozniak,
    on the brink of elimination, put together a personal best jump of 22-4 1/4
    to finish fifth.&nbsp; Chris
    Bateman, while not setting a personal best, jumped well enough to get into
    the finals and place eighth overall.&nbsp;With eight places scoring (10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1)
    this gave MIT a much needed four point advantage over their seed.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji took to the hammer circle as the number one seed
    and on his first throw, with darkness starting to set in, launched a 205-9
    school and meet record.&nbsp; With all of his throws over 190 feet, Orji
    showed he is getting ready for the NCAA championships in three weeks.</p>
  <p align="left">The only track event on the first day was the 10K.&nbsp; MIT
    had three entries in the event with Eric Khatchadourian seeded sixth and
    Steve Maltas seeded seventh.&nbsp; Maltas and Khatchadourian as well as Joe
    Roy-Mayhew went with the pack, running a casual 5:15 first mile, 10:27
    second mile and 15:44 third mile.&nbsp; Maltas stayed on pace through the
    fourth mile with a 20:57 split but Khatchadourian and Roy-Mayhew fell off
    the pace to 21:05 and 21:07 respectively.&nbsp; In the fifth mile Maltas
    dropped off the pace a little and a lot more in the sixth.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
    he was able to 33:01.84 to hold onto third place.&nbsp; Roy-Mayhew passed
    Khatchadourian at the start of the sixth mile and finished in sixth place
    with Khatchadourian, who is still getting back his strength from his bout
    with the flu, just behind in seventh.&nbsp; Maltas's
    bonus six points put MIT 10 points up on the first day.</p>
  <p align="left">Day two started off the triple jump.&nbsp; Anthony Teixeira,
    who had jumped to a 20-9 1/4 personal best in the long jump on Friday, had
    to jump without one contact as he had developed pink eye during the long
    jump competition and the medication received at the hospital prevented him
    from putting in his other contact.&nbsp; This affected his depth perception,
    causing him to abort his first two attempts.&nbsp; On his third attempt he
    jumped 42-11 but that missed finals by a couple of inches and one spot.&nbsp;&quot;Tex&quot;
    proceeded over to the 110HH trials where he qualified for the finals and
    eventually placed sixth, scoring three unexpected points for the Engineers.</p>
  <p align="left">Jake Ruzevick, unable to practice early in the week due to
    the flu, was seeded fourth in the steeplechase.&nbsp; He, Chris Bruce and
    Rocco Repetski toed the line for Tech at the start of the race.&nbsp; After
    the first mile it was clear Ruzevick was not at the top of his game.&nbsp; He
    had also developed a technique problem that was leading to his quads getting
    fatigued prematurely.&nbsp; Chris Bruce stepped up and ran with the leaders
    until the end of the race, running a huge personal best, placing sixth in
    9:39.27.&nbsp; Ruzevick &quot;gutted it out&quot; to finish seventh in 9:41.72.&nbsp; While
    not placing, Repetski ran an eight second PR for a 10:04.42 performance.&nbsp; MIT
    scored the five points it was seeded for but not in the expected manner. </p>
  <p align="left">In the 4x100, MIT was seeded sixth but their goal of running
    sub 43 would certainly move them up.&nbsp; David Blau led things off with
    a fantastic leg to put Tech in first at the first exchange.&nbsp; Kenny Rosche
    also ran an exceptional leg putting MIT in a great position.&nbsp; The handoff
    between Rosche and Wozniak could not have been any better and Wozniak proceeded
    to run a screaming curve.&nbsp; The final handoff to Demario Dayton was also
    excellent.&nbsp; Dayton stumbled slightly getting going allowing a couple
    of teams to catch up.&nbsp; The team finished in fourth, running 42.73 to
    reach their goal and score two more points than they were seeded.</p>
  <p align="left">Fivos Constantinou knew if her were going to score in the 1500
    that he would probably have to win the slow section.&nbsp; The first quarter
    was plenty fast at 62 seconds but the second quarter slowed to 2:09.&nbsp; Constantinou
    took over, running a little too aggressively with a 61 third quarter to come
    through 1200 in 3:10.&nbsp; Fatiguing as one might expect, Constantinou nevertheless
    held onto second place in the section, running a season best of 3:59.81.&nbsp; Overall,
    he finished in eighth to provide MIT with yet one more unexpected point.</p>
  <p align="left">The meet had gone so well for the Engineers that the coaching
    staff was beginning to wonder if this might be the perfect meet.&nbsp; Once
    Omari Stephens, a third seed in the pole vault, went out at 12-9, the wondering
    was over.&nbsp; The loss of the six points would be something the Engineers
    would have to make up.</p>
  <p align="left">Orji took to the shot put circle in similar fashion to the
    hammer the night before, although this time it took him two throws to set
    a season best and a new meet record of 58-7 1/2.&nbsp; James Oleinik, seeded
    sixth, did not disappoint.&nbsp; For most of the competition Oleinik was
    in fifth place but lost that position in the final round.&nbsp; Oleinik threw
    48-2 1/2 to almost match his personal best.</p>
  <p align="left">In an event where MIT thought they had a sure point total of
    at least six, the 100 meter dash proved to be anything but.&nbsp; After running
    a casual 10.97 in the trials, Blau appeared ready to take care of business.&nbsp; In
    the set position, Blau flinched a little and thinking he would be called
    for a false start he had already dropped down from his &quot;set&quot; position and
    failed to go with the gun.&nbsp; Once
    he realized his error he ran the 100 to secure the one point.</p>
  <p align="left">Orji again took to the circle, this time for the discus.&nbsp; Seeded
    fifth and struggling all season with his least favorite throwing event, MIT
    was hoping for status quo at best.&nbsp; However, being the champion that
    he is, Orji threw a season best of 150-0 on his final throw to move up to
    fourth place, making up for one of the lost points.</p>
  <p align="left">The only event remaining in which the Engineers had a good
    opportunity to score   was the 200.&nbsp; Blau, obviously upset about the
    100, got out a little too hard, clearly leading a very talented field into
    the final straight.&nbsp; While three of the top seeds passed him, Blau held
    on to place one position higher than he was seeded, giving MIT five points.</p>
  <p align="left">Going into the final event, the 1600 meter relay, MIT was in
    second with Tufts three and a half points back.&nbsp; Tufts had the fifth
    fastest relay time and MIT the 13th.&nbsp; If Tufts ran their seed they would
    score four points and surpass MIT for second.&nbsp; MIT, racing in the unseeded
    section was unable to run their best, placing third in their section.&nbsp; At
    the start of the seeded section, Middlebury, a higher seed than Tufts was
    called for movement in the set position thus getting disqualified from the
    race.&nbsp; Tufts proceeded to place fifth, scoring the necessary four points
    to overtake MIT.&nbsp; Tufts performed well and left all of their top distance
    runners out of the meet, which would have surely put them in second easily.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT is host to the All Division New England Championship
    for men and women (NEICAAA) Thursday through Saturday.</p>
