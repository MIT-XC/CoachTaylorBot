Convincing Win in Engineer's Cup</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>April 3, 1999</P>

<P>Emotions were unusually high for the first meet of the 1999
regular season. Rarely does the Men's Track and Field Team get "up"
for the first scoring meet of the season, particularly when the
weather is not usually the best, and the competition is not as strong
as the team just faced on their annual spring trip. However, the fact
that RPI came to MIT last year and handed them their first loss ever
in the Engineer's Cup, combined with a decision made by WPI and
others to not allow MIT to compete in a meet on April 17 when MIT had
an open date and needed a meet, served to wet MIT's competitive
appetite.</P>

<P>Injuries to Jordan Alperin and Roger Nielsen, both entered in the
High Jump, 110HH, and 400IH, took some serious points away from Tech
before the meet ever started. This combined with the fact that Ravi
Sastry and Kalpak Kothari are nursing season long injuries, and thus
not up to full competitive efforts, had the meet on paper as a 3
point MIT victory over RPI.</P>

<P>The meet got started with many field events starting at once. The
brightest moment for MIT came right at the beginning when sophomore
Nick Michalakis threw 193-5 on his first attempt in the Javelin to
qualify him for the National Championships. Nick just finished the
volleyball season right before Spring Break and had only practiced
for one week. He threw 193 on his second throw as well, and then
stopped due to a sore hamstring. </P>

<P>The Hammer was not particularly strong, but MIT scored 3 points
behind Jason Dailey's throw of 143-10. The meet was not going badly
with the points fairly evenly distributed with RPI at 10, MIT at 8,
and WPI with 4.</P>

<P>The Long Jump did not go the way MIT wanted due to a 22-2 1/4 jump
by Jordan of RPI. Ravi tried to answer but could only produce a 21-7
3/4 effort. Robbie Gray came through with a 3rd place 20-1 1/4 jump,
but RPI took 4th place.</P>

<P>The High Jump turned out to be MIT's worst event, not helped by
MIT's injured and absent jumpers. RPI went 1-2 with both jumpers
going 6-2. Sastry managed 6-0 for 3rd, but RPI had a lead of 18 to
MIT's 15 and WPI's 11.</P>

<P>The first running event, the 3000 Steeplechase, one of MIT's
strengths, did not go quite the way MIT hoped. Mark Strauss came
through with an easy victory, running 9:28, but Mike Parkins has yet
to shake an early season funk prolonged by a cold that is affecting
his breathing. Mike ran only 9:50 as an RPI runner managed a 2nd
place. Phil Loiselle took a header on the last lap and was unable to
catch the 4th place which went to another RPI runner.</P>

<P>The 400 Relay was the first event to go in MIT's favor. The
quartet of Gray, Neal Karchem, Todd Rosenfield, and Sastry ran 44.40,
which should not have won, but RPI failed to make the handoff in the
first exchange. The failed handoff, not only kept RPI from winning,
but also meant they got left out of the scoring all together.</P>

<P>The Pole Vault was supposed to be a good battle, but it never
materialized. With 6 vaulters remaining, MIT had 4 of them at 12-0.
One of those four, Sam Thibault, had not come in as yet, but is
consistent at 13-3. However, on this day he failed to make his
opening height. Tech vaulters earned 1st (Dan Kwon), a tie for 2nd
(Matt Potts), and 4th place (Sam Sidiqi) to come away with 8 1/2
points to WPI's 2 1/2, and RPI's 0. The team scores were now MIT 35
1/2, RPI 22, and WPI 14.</P>

<P>The 1500, MIT's premier event, gave Tech a 24 point lead when Sean
Montgomery, Leif Seed, Dan Feldman, and Chris McGuire sweeping the
event.</P>

<P>The High Hurdles were much the same, even without Alperin and
Nielsen. Sastry and Peter Bluvas went 1-2 to pretty much put the meet
out of reach.</P>

<P>The Discus and Shot Put went better than expected. The MIT coaches
did not expect any points in those events, but Bluvas came through
with a 3rd place in the Shot.</P>

<P>The final field event, the Triple Jump, came down to the final
jump. Kothari, nursing his ankle, took only 1 jump and tried to hold
on, hoping no one would pass him. However, Jordan of RPI, winner of
the Long Jump and High Jump, took the lead on his final attempt.
Kothari, forced to jump one more time, regained the lead and the
victory with a 42-3 effort.</P>

<P>MIT won every running event except for the 100 and 200, where they
still claimed 2nd place and at least one other place. Tech went 1-2-3
in the 400 with Karchem leading the way with a season best of 51.35.
In the 800, MIT had another sweep with Montgomery, Alan Raphael, John
Biesiadecki, and Kenny Walker taking the honors. Leif Seed won the
400IH in his first effort of the season with a time of 57.06,
qualifying him for the New England Division III Championship.</P>

<P>MIT backed off in the 5000, only entering 2 contestants. Dan
Feldman went wire to wire with a 15:39.6 victory. The final event was
the 1600 Relay. MIT entered their best team in hopes of trying to
improve a foursome that could vie for the New England Division III
title. The competition and weather were not there, but MIT won easily
in 3:27.55. The final score was 110 1/2 for MIT to 55 for RPI to 37
1/2 to WPI.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT takes on the State of Maine when they travel to
Bowdoin to compete against Bowdoin, Bates, and Colby.</P>
