    Convincing Win in Engineer's Cup**
    
    
    
    April 3, 1999
    
    
    
    
    
    Emotions were unusually high for the first meet of the 1999
    regular season. Rarely does the Men's Track and Field Team get "up"
    for the first scoring meet of the season, particularly when the
    weather is not usually the best, and the competition is not as strong
    as the team just faced on their annual spring trip. However, the fact
    that RPI came to MIT last year and handed them their first loss ever
    in the Engineer's Cup, combined with a decision made by WPI and
    others to not allow MIT to compete in a meet on April 17 when MIT had
    an open date and needed a meet, served to wet MIT's competitive
    appetite.
    
    
    
    
    
    Injuries to Jordan Alperin and Roger Nielsen, both entered in the
    High Jump, 110HH, and 400IH, took some serious points away from Tech
    before the meet ever started. This combined with the fact that Ravi
    Sastry and Kalpak Kothari are nursing season long injuries, and thus
    not up to full competitive efforts, had the meet on paper as a 3
    point MIT victory over RPI.
    
    
    
    
    
    The meet got started with many field events starting at once. The
    brightest moment for MIT came right at the beginning when sophomore
    Nick Michalakis threw 193-5 on his first attempt in the Javelin to
    qualify him for the National Championships. Nick just finished the
    volleyball season right before Spring Break and had only practiced
    for one week. He threw 193 on his second throw as well, and then
    stopped due to a sore hamstring. 
    
    
    
    
    
    The Hammer was not particularly strong, but MIT scored 3 points
    behind Jason Dailey's throw of 143-10. The meet was not going badly
    with the points fairly evenly distributed with RPI at 10, MIT at 8,
    and WPI with 4.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Long Jump did not go the way MIT wanted due to a 22-2 1/4 jump
    by Jordan of RPI. Ravi tried to answer but could only produce a 21-7
    3/4 effort. Robbie Gray came through with a 3rd place 20-1 1/4 jump,
    but RPI took 4th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    The High Jump turned out to be MIT's worst event, not helped by
    MIT's injured and absent jumpers. RPI went 1-2 with both jumpers
    going 6-2. Sastry managed 6-0 for 3rd, but RPI had a lead of 18 to
    MIT's 15 and WPI's 11.
    
    
    
    
    
    The first running event, the 3000 Steeplechase, one of MIT's
    strengths, did not go quite the way MIT hoped. Mark Strauss came
    through with an easy victory, running 9:28, but Mike Parkins has yet
    to shake an early season funk prolonged by a cold that is affecting
    his breathing. Mike ran only 9:50 as an RPI runner managed a 2nd
    place. Phil Loiselle took a header on the last lap and was unable to
    catch the 4th place which went to another RPI runner.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 400 Relay was the first event to go in MIT's favor. The
    quartet of Gray, Neal Karchem, Todd Rosenfield, and Sastry ran 44.40,
    which should not have won, but RPI failed to make the handoff in the
    first exchange. The failed handoff, not only kept RPI from winning,
    but also meant they got left out of the scoring all together.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Pole Vault was supposed to be a good battle, but it never
    materialized. With 6 vaulters remaining, MIT had 4 of them at 12-0.
    One of those four, Sam Thibault, had not come in as yet, but is
    consistent at 13-3. However, on this day he failed to make his
    opening height. Tech vaulters earned 1st (Dan Kwon), a tie for 2nd
    (Matt Potts), and 4th place (Sam Sidiqi) to come away with 8 1/2
    points to WPI's 2 1/2, and RPI's 0. The team scores were now MIT 35
    1/2, RPI 22, and WPI 14.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 1500, MIT's premier event, gave Tech a 24 point lead when Sean
    Montgomery, Leif Seed, Dan Feldman, and Chris McGuire sweeping the
    event.
    
    
    
    
    
    The High Hurdles were much the same, even without Alperin and
    Nielsen. Sastry and Peter Bluvas went 1-2 to pretty much put the meet
    out of reach.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Discus and Shot Put went better than expected. The MIT coaches
    did not expect any points in those events, but Bluvas came through
    with a 3rd place in the Shot.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final field event, the Triple Jump, came down to the final
    jump. Kothari, nursing his ankle, took only 1 jump and tried to hold
    on, hoping no one would pass him. However, Jordan of RPI, winner of
    the Long Jump and High Jump, took the lead on his final attempt.
    Kothari, forced to jump one more time, regained the lead and the
    victory with a 42-3 effort.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT won every running event except for the 100 and 200, where they
    still claimed 2nd place and at least one other place. Tech went 1-2-3
    in the 400 with Karchem leading the way with a season best of 51.35.
    In the 800, MIT had another sweep with Montgomery, Alan Raphael, John
    Biesiadecki, and Kenny Walker taking the honors. Leif Seed won the
    400IH in his first effort of the season with a time of 57.06,
    qualifying him for the New England Division III Championship.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT backed off in the 5000, only entering 2 contestants. Dan
    Feldman went wire to wire with a 15:39.6 victory. The final event was
    the 1600 Relay. MIT entered their best team in hopes of trying to
    improve a foursome that could vie for the New England Division III
    title. The competition and weather were not there, but MIT won easily
    in 3:27.55. The final score was 110 1/2 for MIT to 55 for RPI to 37
    1/2 to WPI.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT takes on the State of Maine when they travel to
    Bowdoin to compete against Bowdoin, Bates, and Colby.

    **N.E. DIV. III
    CHAMPIONSHIPS**
    
    
    
    
    
    May 1, 1999
    
    
    
    
    
    Enjoying the first warm day of the spring season, MIT went to
    Williams College for a non-scoring invitational against Williams,
    Tufts, Westfield State, Keene St., Plattsburgh State, and
    UMass-Dartmouth. 11 personal bests were set with many of MIT's better
    performers back at home with strep throat and walking pneumonia.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the field events, Jason Dailey put it together in the Hammer
    Throw with a 154-7 effort to qualify for the New England Division III
    Championships (NEDiv.3), and close in on the national qualifying mark
    of 162-5.
    
    
    
    
    
    Freshmen had strong days in the running events. In the 100,
    freshman Robbie Gray ran a best of 11.50. In the 400, Yuval Mazor,
    another freshman ran the fastest 400 of the season with a 50.90 time.
    Yuval was followed by Neal Karchem with a season best of 51.07. Tony
    Pelosi ran almost two seconds faster than before in the 400 IH with a
    58.69 performance. Alan Raphael, yet another freshman held on to a
    very fast first 400 of 56 to finish in a personal best of 1:58.73 in
    the 800. Also running a best in the 800 was Matt Yarosz with a
    2:01.38 time.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the distance events, Mike Parkins led the way with a season
    best of 9:26.77 in the 3000 Steeplechase. Phil Loiselle also ran a
    best in the Steeplechase with a 9:50.88 performance. Liyan Guo ran a
    great 5000 in the heat, running a consistent pace and finishing with
    a best of 15:45.60.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final event was the best one of all. Williams, Tufts, and MIT
    had all already run 3:20 to 3:22 in the 1600 Relay. MIT was without
    anchor Sean Montgomery, buy nevertheless fielded a very competent
    team. Mazor led things off with a 50.4 and was slightly behind both
    teams. Karchem took over and brought the baton home in first by a
    step in 49.5. Todd Rosenfield was next with a 50.6 that put Tech
    about 5 meters behind Williams and about 10 meters in front of Tufts.
    Leif Seed took over anchor duties and ran a strong 49.8 to finish in
    a season best of 3:20.42, the fastest time since 1990. Williams won
    with a 3:18.44 and Tufts finished 3rd in 3:22.05.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT travels to Colby for the New England Division III
    Championships. If the sick can get healthy within the next week, the
    Engineers hope to place in the top 3 teams. Williams and Wheaton will
    probably be the favorites going into the meet.

    **MIT Uses Strength in Distances and Jumps
    to Win Quad Meet**
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    April 10, 1999
    
    
    
    
    
    Going into Saturday's meet at Bowdoin
    against Colby and Southern Maine, MIT was concerned about the
    outcome particularly with three key athletes missing. All three
    happened to be in the 110 HH, 400IH, and High Jump, and one of them
    was a solid favorite in the Long Jump. By estimations, MIT was giving
    up 25 points, which if all went to one team would be a 50 point
    difference.
    
    
    
    
    
    Abandoning the notion of having a meet where individuals could
    focus on going all out in their primary event, the team set to work
    on how they could return to Cambridge still undefeated. Using a
    familiar strategy, Tech loaded up the distance events, doubling the
    1500 and Steeplchase runners in the 800 or 5000. This gave MIT 37 out
    of possible 44 points in the 800, 1500, 3000SC, and 5000 Meter races,
    which sealed the outcome in MIT's favor. Leading the way were double
    victors, Sean Montgomery in the 800 and 1500, and Mark Strauss in the
    3000SC and 5000.
    
    
    
    
    
    The jumps did not start off well, but finished on a high note.
    Without Sastry, Alperin, or Kothari, Tech got blanked in the Long
    Jump. However, MIT won the remaining jumping events and also got
    second in both the High Jump and Pole Vault. The key moment in the
    jumps was Leif Seed's success in the High Jump. Leif has jumped only
    a few times in his four years at MIT as he is primarily a middle
    distance runner. On this occasion, since so many high jumpers were
    missing, Leif volunteered to demonstrate his verticle leaping
    ability. After missing once at 5'6", Leif made 5'8 and 5'10 on first
    attempts to claim second before he had to go over and run the
    1500.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the throws, Nikos Michalakis, threw a personal best for the
    third meet in succession with a nationally automatic qualifying throw
    of 195-10 in the Javelin. Nikos is currently ranked 6th in NCAA
    Division III. Tech's only other scorer in the throws was Jason Dailey
    with a PR of 148-2 in the Hammer, which was good enough for 4th. 
    
    
    
    
    
    The big event of the day, and one everyone was anticipating, was
    the 1600 Relay. Colby had defeated MIT while in San Diego with a fast
    time of 3:22.18 to MIT's 3:24.52. In that race, MIT had a terrible
    handoff on the anchor leg that caused Sean Montgomery to come to a
    complete stop. On their spring break at the Florida Relays, Bowdoin
    had run 3:21. Arguably, these were the three top relay teams in New
    England, squaring off at the end of a quadrangular meet in very windy
    conditions that made the high 40 degree temperatures seem much
    colder.
    
    
    
    
    
    The leadoff was less than ideal for MIT, who had already clinched
    the meet regardless of the outcome of the relay, as Todd Rosenfield
    brought the baton home in 52.0. Leif Seed, in his 4th event of the
    day was 15 meters from the lead at the handoff, but made up the
    entire distance and then some as he gave Tech the lead with an
    outstanding 49.9 leg. Neal Karchem took it out hard but got passed by
    Colby on the final turn. Not giving up, Neal fought back to give Sean
    Montgomery a 2 meter lead at the handoff with his 50.3 leg. Making up
    for San Diego, Neal and Sean's handoff was good enough to open up a 5
    meter lead. Sean turned it up a notch, fought the wind down the
    backstretch, and brought it home in 49.6 to edge a fast closing
    Bowdoin 3:22.02 to 3:22.13 and 3:22.73 for Colby.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final score was MIT 81, Colby 66, Bowdoin 49, and Southern
    Maine 11. Next week, MIT is home in a dual meet vs. Tufts.

    Although the MIT Men's Track Team qualified 7 individuals for the
    Division III National Championships, only 4 were actually accepted
    into the very competitive fields. The minimum number of athletes
    accepted into each event is 15 for the Outdoor Championship, and the
    committee fills the fields based on those athletes who have qualified
    and entered more than one event in order to reach a fixed number of
    total athletes at the meet. This usually means that each event has
    about 17 athletes with the exception of the 100, 200, and 400, which
    tend to have higher numbers because a number of the fill in people
    are already there for a relay.
    
    
    
    
    
    Those making the field for MIT were Leif Seed, who was seeded 3rd
    in the 800, Sean Montgomery, who was seeded 9th in the 1500, Nikos
    Michalakis, who was seeded 10th in the Javelin, and Ravi Sastry, who
    was seeded 15th in the Long Jump. Not accepted into the fields were
    Mike Parkins in the Steeplechase with a 9:17.9 performance, and Chris
    McGuire and Dan Feldman in the 10k with 31:23.73 and 31:26.7
    performances respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sean led things off on Thursday with his 1500 trial. Sean
    established himself amongst the leaders, and moved when they moved.
    Coming through splits of 62, 2:06, and 3:10, the leaders picked
    things up over the last 300 meters. Sean finished with a 43 last 300
    to end up 4th in his heat and that placed him 4th overall as well
    with a 3:53.10 going into Saturday's final.
    
    
    
    
    
    On Friday, Ravi went after the Long Jump in the morning. Not
    having jumped competitively in two weeks due to his thesis needing
    some work, Ravi seemed a little off on his timing. Consequently, he
    only got off a jump of 21-10 3/4, far off of his best of 23-4 3/4.
    Ravi ended up 15th in a field that required a 25' effort to place in
    the top 3 and 23-8 1/4 to place.
    
    
    
    
    
    Later in the day, Leif took to the track in the 800. The field in
    the 800 was separated by only 2.15 seconds, and it took a 1:52.39 to
    get into the meet. Leif was in the second of 3 heats that were
    advancing the first two finishers from each and the next two fastest
    times for Saturday's final. Leif's heat went out in a very slow 55.6
    first quarter. Rather than panic, they all moved, very fast. Leif was
    in position to move to the lead with 200 meters to go but held back a
    second too long. Coming into the finish Leif lost a position and
    finished in 4th, but with a new personal best of 1:50.86. The first
    and third heats were much slower and Leif made it in as the 4th seed
    overall into the finals.
    
    
    
    
    
    On Saturday morning the Javelin started in a light rain after
    there had been a downpour for the preceding two hours. This did not
    help the grass approach, which was quite slick at the point of
    release. Nikos, who had injured his back 3 weeks earlier, and had not
    thrown at all for 3 weeks until testing it on Tuesday and Wednesday
    to see if it was ready, seemed his usually confident self. The
    thinking was that the wet surface might actually work to his
    advantage since he depends on his amazing arm speed much more than
    his leg block. Admittedly cautious, Nikos opened up with a 189'
    effort that had him in 7th after the first round. In the second round
    Nikos moved up to 6th, and in the final round of the trials, Nikos
    moved into 4th place with a 193-0 effort. In the finals, Nikos was
    unable to improve on his throw and one athlete moved past him in the
    first round of the finals. Nikos earned his first All-American honor
    while scoring 4 points for MIT in an amazing effort given his back
    injury.
    
    
    
    
    
    Nearly as soon as the Javelin was completed, Sean was on the track
    for the 1500 final. This time the pace went out pretty quickly in 62
    seconds, again with Sean tucked away in 3rd position. Robert Mitchell
    from Amherst College, the defending champion in the 1500 and entered
    in the 5000 in 50 minutes, obviously wanted to slow the pace down as
    he took the lead and then backed off. The pack came through the 800
    in 2:08, and then Mitchell took off. Coming into the home stretch
    with a little over a lap to go, Sean was moving out a little to get
    around the 4th place runner when the runner behind him shoved him in
    the back, causing Sean to nearly fall down. Even though Sean came
    through the 1200 in 3:08, it was obvious that the push took a lot out
    of him, both physically and mentally. Most of the pack went by him in
    the final 200 meters as he finished a disappointed 10th in 3:54.87.
    With two years of eligibility remaining in Outdoor Track and 3
    remaining Indoors, Sean is certain to be back to exact some
    revenge.
    
    
    
    
    
    Leif was the final Tech competitor. Set up in lane 1, Leif had to
    be cautious to not let the others runners box him in when they broke
    after the first turn. To accomplish this, Leif moved out to lane 2 as
    they were moving in, and settled in the middle of the pack. Again,
    the pace was slow going into the second lap as they came through the
    400 in 55.3. Leif went with them but once again did not make a
    crucial move with 200 to go. This mental lapse caused him to get
    boxed in and in 6th place coming out of the final turn. Leif put the
    hammer down as he squeezed and weaved past two runners. With a burst
    in the last 10 meters, Leif moved into 3rd place with a time of
    1:50.90. Leif, who last made it to Nationals in the 3000 Steeplechase
    in his sophomore year, finished his career in fine fashion, earning
    All-American honors and scoring 6 more points for MIT.

    May 8, 1999
    
    
    
    
    
    Eleven out of 24 performances produced personal bests to lead MIT
    from a predicted third place finish to a 2nd place trophy with 74
    points. Williams College won as expected with 102 1/2 points. Wheaton
    College, seeded 2nd among the 29 participating teams, failed to live
    up to expectations, finishing a disappointing 8th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    The New England Division III Championships is a Men's only meet,
    which is competed in 1 day except for the Decathlon. The trials are
    in the morning and finals in the afternoon for a total of 5 hours.
    Scoring goes 8 deep with points awarded 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT had not had things go their way going into the competition.
    Sophomore, Nikos Michalakis, the 2nd ranked javelin thrower in the
    region, was unable to compete because of a back injury sustained
    while throwing. In addition, all but one of the distance runners
    seeded to score had been sick recently with walking pneumonia or
    strep throat. Nevertheless, the Engineers lived up to their
    reputation of never giving up, scoring in all but three of the events
    entered. 
    
    
    
    
    
    Peter Bluvas '01, led things off with a stirring 2nd place finish
    in the decathlon, which was held on Thursday and Friday. Peter,
    seeded 7th, came from last place after the Long Jump, and won four of
    the next eight events with 6 personal bests to move into 2nd place.
    Going into the 1500, the last event, Peter needed to be within 26
    seconds of his closest competitors. The two competitors in 3rd and
    4th happened to be excellent middle distance runners. Aware of their
    plight, they both went out hard for the first quarter (66 seconds).
    This pulled Peter out a little too hard even though he slowed down at
    the 200 mark. The second quarter was painful for Peter as he slowed
    to an 81 pace while the two who were trying to beat him came through
    the half in 2:21. Peter could do no better than another 81 for the
    third quarter as the two in front opened up a 14 second lead. In the
    last 300 meters Peter gave it all he had, finishing in 4:45 to 4:27
    and 4:28 for his rivals, giving Peter 2nd place.
    
    
    
    
    
    With the 8 points in hand, Tech set off on Saturday to get the job
    done. The first event was the 10K. Chris McGuire '00, was seeded 3rd
    but was still feeling the effects from his strep throat. Chris
    battled hard for the first two miles (9:53), but began running 79
    pace by the end of mile 3. Nevertheless, Chris held on to 4th place
    to give MIT 5 more points.
    
    
    
    
    
    Ravi Sastry '98, was next up in the Long Jump where he was seeded
    3rd behind two 24 foot jumpers. Ravi put together some good jumps but
    nothing over 22-11 3/4, which netted him the expected 3rd place.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Pole Vault, Triple Jump, and High Jump all began about the
    same time. The three entered MIT vaulters were all recovering from
    injuries and were not expected to place. Sam Thibault, Tech's best
    vaulter was at home with an injured hamstring. Matt Potts had an
    injured heel and only jumped 12-3. Dan Kwon (back), and Sam Sidiqi
    (quad) managed 12-9 but could not break into the scoring. Jordan
    Alperin '02, came back from an early season injury and cleared 6-3 in
    the High Jump for a personal best to claim 3rd place when the top
    jumper no-heighted at 6-7. Kalpak Kothari '01, finally reversed the
    tables on his opponents, coming from behind on his last jump to set a
    personal best of 45-3 3/4 to win the Triple Jump.
    
    
    
    
    
    On the track, the 400 Relay was the first final of the afternoon.
    Seeded 11th, MIT was in the first and slowest section. Although they
    won their section with a season best of 43.78, they were not able to
    beat any times from the fast section where the 8th place team ran
    43.19.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the Steeplechase, Mike Parkins '99, was seeded 4th and Mark
    Strauss '01, 5th. The early pace was very fast, with the leaders
    going out in sub 4:50 for the 1600. Parkins held on through 5 laps
    but then faded to third. On the last straight, two more opponents
    passed Mike to put him in 5th with a season best of 9:19.88. Mark did
    not hold on to the early pace and finished in 9:44.51, out of the
    scoring.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 1500 was next, and much of MIT's hopes were in this event.
    Sean Montgomery '01, was seeded 3rd, and Leif Seed '99, was seeded
    5th. The early pace was very fast as Geoff Getz from Brandeis took it
    out in 59 at the quarter. Slowing down, but not significantly, they
    all came through the 800 in 2:03. Sean appeared to want to take the
    lead but remembered the race plan and held back. When they came
    through he 1200 in 3:07, Getz got a jump on Sean and Leif. Sean made
    an attempt to reel him in, but gave up in the last 100 as his legs no
    longer wanted to respond. Sean finished in 2nd with a PR of 3:53.58,
    good enough to rank him 9th nationally in Division III. Leif finished
    in 4th with a 3:55.59, also good enough to qualify provisionally for
    Nationals.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sastry and Alperin made the finals of the 110HH, Jordan running a
    PR of 15.68 in the trials. Ravi got out behind at the start and was
    never able to quite make up the difference, even though he ran a .16
    PR of 15.02. Jordan was not able to match his trials performance but
    scored nevertheless, giving MIT 2nd and 8th in the event.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sean and Leif were back on the track 40 minutes after their 1500
    to race in the 800. Against Coach Taylor's better judgment, he, Sean
    and Leif agreed to try and go for the double in hopes of helping MIT
    catch Williams. Unfortunately, these decisions have to be made
    earlier in the week, and scratching from an event disqualifies that
    athlete from the meet. Putting his best foot forward, Leif stuck with
    the pack through the first quarter of 55 seconds. However, in the
    last 400, Leif faded to last before sprinting hard to the finish to
    end up 6th in his section with a 1:55.18. Two athletes beat him out
    of the slow section to push him back to 8th. Sean did not fare so
    well, finishing in 2:00 and out of the money.
    
    
    
    
    
    Dan Feldman, recovering from his walking pneumonia, but not 100%,
    ran a good race in the 5000 to finish 3rd in 15:15.96. Dan made the
    error of leading the first mile in very windy conditions. Although
    the pack came through the mile in 4:44, the leaders seemed
    comfortable. The next mile slowed somewhat, but the leaders still ran
    a 4:50 second mile. Dan fell off the pace and could only maintain 76
    pace for the final mile.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final event was the 1600 Relay. MIT was ahead of Colby by 10
    points going into the race. Colby, having one of the top teams,
    needed to win the event, and hope that MIT did not score in order to
    tie for 2nd place overall. With two of MIT's key legs on the relay
    being Sean and Leif, that particular scenario was not unrealistic.
    Coach Taylor was indeed kicking himself for having doubled the two
    runners in the 800. Yuval Mazor '02, continued to show improvement as
    he came in with the leaders in 50.5 for the leadoff. Leif took the
    baton and moved into 2nd place on the backstretch. Coming into the
    finish, two opposing runners passed Leif and boxed him in, forcing
    him to split them and risk disqualification. Fortunately, Leif got by
    without harm, running a 49.8, and made a great exchange to Neal
    Karchem. Neal took his leg out hard, battling for 2nd the entire way
    to run a great 49.7 split. Sean took the baton virtually even with
    three other teams. Sean moved into 2nd behind Amherst on the
    backstretch but lost it on the final curve. Making a comeback, Sean
    passed Williams for 3rd but did not quite have enough to catch Colby
    for 2nd. Nevertheless, the quartet ran an MIT best since 1990 with a
    3:19.94 clocking.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT travels back to Maine for the All Division New
    England Championships being held at the University of Maine on Friday
    and Saturday, the 14th and 15th of May. Only those hoping to qualify
    for Nationals or improve their national qualifying marks on going for
    MIT. Currently, MIT has 6 individuals qualified for Nationals, and
    the hopes of a couple more qualifying in a definite possibility.

    ENGLANDS**
    
    
    
    **MIT Track and Field Set Personal or Season
    Bests in Every Individual Event**
    
    
    
    
    
    May 15-16
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT Track and Field had a great weekend at the All Division New
    England Championship hosted by the University of Maine. While many
    MIT athletes could not attend due to end of term academic projects
    and exam preparation, those who were able to go made the most of the
    opportunity.
    
    
    
    
    
    On Friday, Sean Montgomery led things off in the 1500 Trials with
    his best race ever. Sean went with the leaders through splits of 61,
    2:04, and 3:07. With 300 to go, the lead group took off with Sean
    among them. Sean finished 4th in his heat with an automatic
    qualifying time of 3:51.89. Only three from each heat automatically
    advanced to the finals, but Sean ended up being in the fastest heat
    and had the 4th fastest time of the day, easily advancing to the
    finals.
    
    
    
    
    
    Leif Seed took the line next in the 800 trials. Leif's heat went
    out in a casual 56 at the 400 and he stayed with the leaders. When
    the leader went, Leif went also, finishing 2nd in his heat with a
    1:53.23, which qualified him for the finals.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 5000 final was the first running event final. Mark Strauss was
    the lone MIT entry and scored the first MIT points with a 6th place
    finish. Mark began the race conservatively and worked his way up in
    the pack for the first mile of the race, but gradually began to lose
    ground to the leaders. Mark came back in the 3rd mile with a strong
    last two laps, but could not quite reel in 5th place. Mark finished
    with an outdoor best of 15:01.78.
    
    
    
    
    
    The last race of the day was the 10,000 Meter race. Freshman Dan
    Feldman, having a great rookie year in both Cross Country and Indoor
    Track, has been sick for most of the Outdoor Track season. Even
    though he had placed in both the NEWMAC and New England Division III
    Championships, Dan did not feel he had had a good outdoor season.
    Feeling almost healthy for the first time this season, Dan went with
    the leaders in a perfect 5:00 per mile pace. At three miles, Dan was
    still uncharacteristically settled in behind a group of three other
    runners as they came through in 15:02. At four miles they were in
    20:06 and the lead runner broke away. The other two and Dan battled
    it out for a couple of laps until one fell a little back, leaving
    just Dan and a runner from Yale to battle it out for 2nd. At five
    miles they slowed slightly to 25:09, but Dan was determined to hold
    on and try to qualify for Nationals. Pushing his body to the max, Dan
    tried to break away with 2 laps to go. However, in the last lap his
    opponent broke away, beating Dan by 3 seconds 31:23 to 31:26.
    Nevertheless, Dan did finish 3rd, qualify provisionally for Nationals
    next weekend and smashed his own freshman record by nearly a minute.
    Dan is currently ranked 25th in all of Division III in the 10K.
    
    
    
    
    
    Saturday began with Sean in the 1500 final. The pace was quick and
    Sean was with the leaders as they came through the quarter in 60. The
    second lap slowed to 2:03 and the lead pack bunched up, which of
    course caused the pace to pick up again. With a lap to go Sean slowed
    a little when the leaders bunched up, which at that phase of the race
    can be deadly. Instead of moving Sean settled. The leaders took off
    with 300 to go, but Sean did not go with them. Failing to capitalize
    on the opportunity, Sean appeared to give up, falling to 10th place
    in 3:54.34.
    
    
    
    
    
    Leif came to the rescue in the 800. Coming through a quick 53.3 in
    the 400, Leif was sitting in 4th with the lead group. At 600, Leif
    had closed to about 10 meters of the lead and looked ready to go for
    the victory. Showing his inexperience, Leif hesitated and lost the
    small window of opportunity. However, Leif did go with them when they
    accelerated, holding onto 5th place in 1:51.10, ranking him 3rd in
    the country for Division 3.
    
    
    
    
    
    Mike Parkins was next up in the 3000 Steeplechase. Mike had
    already qualified provisionally for Nationals but was hoping to
    return to his sophomore year form when he ran 9:12 in this event. The
    pace was perfect and Mike started in the back to insure to not go out
    too fast. Mike was running 74 pace through the first mile, setting
    himself up for a great time. However, he too failed to move when the
    opportunity was there. Instead, he slowed to 76 pace for his 6th and
    7th laps. Mike did finish with a strong last 200 to improve his time
    to 3:17.9 and place 8th, but his time may not be enough to get him
    into Nationals.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final event for Tech and the meet was the 1600 Meter Relay.
    MIT was hoping to qualify provisionally for Nationals with a 3:17
    clocking. Having already run 3:19 with both Leif and Sean having run
    the 1500 and 800 within 1:30 of their relay legs, the quartet thought
    they could get the job done. Yuval Mazor led the way with a 50.6,
    which made their chances pretty sliim. Leif was able to bring the
    stick in in 49.6, but it was not enough for a chance of qualifying.
    Neal Karchem, not accustomed to sitting around for two days without
    racing, seemed stale with his 50.0 leg, and Sean was unable to
    provide the miracle that was needed as the team finished in
    3:20.07.
    
    
    
    
    
    Seven individuals have qualified for Nationals, either
    automatically or provisionally. On Wednesday, those who get accepted
    into the field will depart for Baldwin Wallace College in Berea, Ohio
    for the National Championships.

    **MEN'S TRACK WINS INAUGURAL NEWMAC
    CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
    
    April 24, 1999
    
    
    
    
    
    The first NEWMAC (New England Women's and Men's Athletic
    Conference) Track and Field Championship was held this past Saturday
    at Smith College. MIT used strength in the middle distance and
    distance events along with some key points in the jumps and javelin
    to outscore Wheaton College by 36 points , 189-153. Finishing in
    third was Springfield with 132, Coast Guard in 4th with 96, and WPI
    with 48.
    
    
    
    
    
    On paper, the meet appeared to be Wheaton's jumpers and sprinters
    vs. MIT's middle distance and distance runners. It turned out that
    the paper version was pretty close to the real thing. With a
    10-8-6-4-2-1 scoring format, Wheaton scored 80 points in the 100,
    200, Long Jump, Triple Jump, and High Jump. Whereas MIT scored 95
    points in the 800, 1500, 3000 Steeplechase, 5000, and 10,000 meter
    events. The difference may have been that MIT scored 20 in the five
    favorite Wheaton events, while Wheaton could only manage 10 in MIT's
    favored events.
    
    
    
    
    
    Individually, MIT had many bright spots. In the field events, Ravi
    Sastry continued to jump well as he had a 23-2 effort in the Long
    Jump, good enough for 2nd place. Robbie Gray also added a point with
    a PR of 20-6 1/2. Kalpak Kothari put aside his ankle woes and jumped
    to a PR in the Triple Jump with a 44-10 1/4 effort, sufficient for
    3rd place. In the Javelin, Nikos Michalakis came through on his final
    effort with a 194-7 throw for the win.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the running events, MIT started things off with 25 points in
    the 10K as Chris McGuire led the way with a national qualifying
    provisional time of 31:23.73 to win. Following were Dan Feldman in
    2nd, setting a freshman record with a 32:21.11, Liyan Guo in 3rd with
    a 32:59.65, and Ed Keehr in 6th with a 33:46.55.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next on the track was the 3000 Steeplechase. MIT went 1-2 with
    Mike Parkins, and Mark Strauss doing the honors in 9:35.34 and
    9:40.38 respectively. Phil Loiselle added a 5th with a time of
    10:03.18.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the 400 Relay, the foursome of Gray, Neal Karchem, Todd
    Rosenfield, and Sastry ran a season best of 44.05 to place second to
    Wheaton.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 1500 provided another showcase for MIT's dominance in the
    distance events. Sean Montgomery and Leif Seed sat on the pack until
    200 meters were left and then opened up an easy 2 second gap to go
    1-2. Kenny Walker had a great run to claim 5th with a 4:10.70.
    
    
    
    
    
    The High Hurdles was an exciting race that showcased two of the
    top hurdlers in New England Division 3. Ravi Sastry, last years New
    England Division 3 Champion was seeded behind the Wheaton College
    hurdler. Ravi ran a PR of 15.18 in the finals but finished second to
    his opponent who ran a 14.94. Jordan Alperin placed 5th in the final
    with a 15.96 but pulled his hamstring on the 7th hurdle. Jordan had
    earlier run a PR of 15.79 in the trials.
    
    
    
    
    
    The trio of Karchem, Yuval Mazor, and Rosenfield placed 3-4-5 in
    the 400, and came back in the 200 to all run season bests of 23.37,
    23.74, and 23.81 respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    With Wheaton only 15 points behind going into the 5000, MIT
    distance runners returned to the track for a casual effort just to
    make certain the Wheaton runners did not claim any points that may
    jeopardize MIT's lead. Jogging in a pack for most of the way, MIT
    runners Parkins, Feldman, and McGuire let the lead runner go at the
    start, and finished a tired but comfortable 2-3-4 to lock up the team
    victory.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the final event, the 1600 Relay team of Rosenfield, Yuval
    Mazor, Karchem, and Seed ran to an easy victory with a slow
    3:28.14.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT will rest their tired and wounded when they travel
    to Williams College for a non-scoring invitational.

    **MEN'S TRACK FINISHES REGULAR SEASON
    UNDEFEATED**
    
    
    
    **Defeats Tufts 156-128**
    
    
    
    
    
    April 17, 1999
    
    
    
    
    
    Most of the meets between the Men's Track and Field Teams of MIT
    and Tufts are exciting, close meets. Fortunately, MIT usually comes
    out on top. The meet on Saturday lived up to both historical
    expectations.
    
    
    
    
    
    While not completely healthy, the MIT team was healthy enough to
    have all but two of their athletes competing. Arturo Esparza, a
    freshman steeplechaser may have a stress fracture, and Matt Potts, a
    New England Division III place winner in the Pole Vault, was taking
    the MCATs.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Long Jump was the first event to go off. Ravi Sastry took the
    lead in the Long Jump over favored Rommel Childress from Tufts with a
    21-11 leap. Childress could not adjust his approach for the wind
    conditions and either fouled or was way behind the board. Ravi's
    hamstring is not healed but it felt good enough to go for it on his
    2nd attempt in the finals. He hit the board well, kept his head up
    and extended to a personal best of 23-4 3/4, which qualifies him
    provisionally for the NCAA Championships. Jordan Alperin added a PR
    of 20-1 3/4 to take 4th place.
    
    
    
    
    
    Being only a dual meet, the throwing events did not take long,
    particularly since neither MIT nor Tufts have very strong throwing
    teams right now. Tufts went 1-3 in the Hammer while MIT took 2-4-5
    with Jason Dailey leading the way for MIT with a 141-5 effort. The
    Discus was sad for both schools. Tufts went 1-2-3 with the winning
    throw only going 118-11. The good news is that decathlete Peter
    Bluvas threw 108-5 to bolster his chances of doing well in the
    Decathlon in 3 weeks. Peter also came through in the Shot Put with a
    throw of 41-9 to claim second place. As expected, the best news in
    the throws came from Nikos Michalakis. The sophomore further improved
    on his varsity record with a heave of 198-9, which moves him to 5th
    on the national
    list .
    
    
    
    
    
    Tech did well in all of the jumps, outscoring Tufts 41-23. MIT
    went 1-2-3 in the Pole Vault despite the absence of Potts. Sam
    Thibault and Sam Sidiqi both cleared 13-0 to tie for 1st (deciding
    not to have a jump off), and freshman Dan Kwon vaulted to a PR of
    13-0, but claimed third based on more misses. Ravi Sastry, Jordan
    Alperin, and Roger Nielsen, who is returning to competition after
    missing two weeks, claimed 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in the High Jump to keep
    the pressure on Tufts. In the Triple Jump, Kalpak Kothari had his
    season best of 43-7 1/4, but fell to Childress on his final
    attempt.
    
    
    
    
    
    While the 800-5000 provided Tech with their usual domination of
    points (44-20), it was not quite as strong as hoped. Things got off
    on the wrong foot as David Patterson took the Steeplechase from Mike
    Parkins (9:36) and Mark Strauss (9:40.4). Parkins is just recovering
    from an upper resperitory infection and Strauss looked unusually
    tired. Phil Loiselle ran a season best of 10:00.6 to claim 4th. In
    the 1500, the Engineers went 1-2-3 with Sean Montgomery leading Leif
    Seed and Chris McGuire to the line with a sub 60 last 400. In the
    800, Montgomery won again with a season best of 1:55.34, but Seed
    feeling the effects of a cold, managed only a third with a 1:57.95.
    Not being able to afford to relax with three events to go, the Tech
    distance runners came back in the 5000. Chris McGuire led the way
    with a 2:12 last 800 to win in a pedestrian 15:33.9. Dan Feldman
    added support after leading most of the way with a second place.
    
    
    
    
    
    With Ravi bowing out of the sprints in order to preserve his
    hamstring for next week's conference championships, Tech got swept by
    Tufts in the 100 and 200. However, MIT returned the favor in the High
    Hurdles with Sastry leading the effort in a wind and hamstring
    hampered 16.25. Bluvas and Alperin ran well for 2nd and 3rd.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 1 lap events went about even for MIT. Both Neal Karchem and
    Yuval Mazor ran season bests of 51.14 and 51.41 in the strong wind to
    claim 2nd and 3rd respectively. Todd Rosenfield added a 4th but did
    not finish well. With Leif running the 800, Tech did not have a
    strong leader in the 400 IH. However, Tony Pelosi came through with a
    PR of 59.8 to claim 2nd, and received support from Bluvas and Gus
    Blomquist running to 3rd and 5th place finishes.
    
    
    
    
    
    The relays were scored 6-0, the point swing could be as great as
    24 points. Fortunately, both relays went in MIT's favor, or it would
    have been a 4 point, and much more harrowing meet. In the 400 Relay,
    Ravi was forced to strain more than hoped when he had to make up a 4
    meter deficit on the Tufts anchor to win in a season best of 44.20.
    In the 1600 Relay, Leif was unable to run do to his illness, so Mazor
    was put into action. With three of the legs having run both the 400
    and 200 (20 minutes before), and Montgomery having run the 1500 and
    800 meter runs, the outcome was anything but automatic. Rosenfield
    led off with a tired 52.1 to put MIT even with the Tufts runner.
    Mazor ran a strong 51.4 to bring MIT within 2 meters of Tufts at the
    handoff to Karchem. Neal ran his best leg ever (49.8) to give Sean
    the baton just 1 step behind Tufts. Continuing his streak of
    successful anchors (except the debacle in San Diego), Sean ran a 50.5
    to pull the victory out at the end in 3:23.8.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT travels to Smith College for the inaugural NEWMAC
    (New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference) Conference
    Championship. Wheaton and Springfield will provide plenty of
    competition, but if Tech can stay healthy, the strength in the
    800-5000 should prove lethal to the conference opponents.

    **TECH OPENS UP SPRING TRIP WITH GOOD
    SHOWING AT SANTA BARBARA RELAYS**
    
    
    
    March 20, 1999
    
    
    
    
    
    Santa Barbara, CA
    
    
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    After a very demanding week of mid-term exams and projects with
    little sleep, MIT Men's Track and Field team traveled most of the day
    Friday to Claremont, CA for the beginning of their annual Spring
    Trip. On Saturday morning they traveled an additional 2 hours to
    Santa Barbara to compete in the Santa Barbara Relays. The first half
    of the day was warm and sunny, basically what the team came out west
    for. However, half way into the meet, the rain came. While it never
    rained hard, it did rain most of the meet.
    
    
    
    
    
    Even with the rain, MIT was still happy to have 60+ degree
    temperatures. The first event was the hammer throw. Jason Dailey set
    a personal best with a 140-6 effort. Alumnus, Todd Chamoy, also
    competed and threw 148-10.
    
    
    
    
    
    In other throwing events, Peter Bluvas threw 135-2 in his first
    ever effort in the Javelin, and 39-4 in the Shot Put. Jordan Alperin
    threw 31-5 in the Shot Put, and 90-1 in the Discus for his first
    effort ever.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the jumps, Roger Nielsen cleared 6-0 in the High Jump to match
    his best effort. Sam Thibault made 13-0 in the Pole Vault to qualify
    him for the New England Division III Championships. Robbie Gray
    jumped 19-11 3/4 and 37-9 1/4 in the horizontal jumps, while Kalpak
    Kothari leaped 19-6 and 40-7 3/4.
    
    
    
    
    
    Ravi Sastry did not feel ready to compete due to his ankle and
    hamstring, but the members of the 400 Relay competed anyway with Sam
    Thibault taking Ravi's place at anchor. The foursome of Gray, Neal
    Karchem, Todd Rosenfield, and Thibault won the event with a 44.60
    effort.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the hurdle events, Jordan Alperin ran 16.72 and 60. in the
    400IH. Roger Nielsen and Bluvas ran 17.64 and 17.74 respectively in
    the 110s and 61 and 62 in the 400IH.
    
    
    
    
    
    Sean Montgomery returned to action with a 4:18.10 effort in the
    Mile to win . Leif Seed faded a little at the end but still managed a
    3rd with a 4:21.06.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 3000 Meter Steeplechase saw Mark Strauss return to good form
    with a 9:27.18 run to narrowly miss provisionally qualifying for
    nationals. Mike Parkins faded after the mile mark but still ran
    9:42.28.
    
    
    
    
    
    Chris McGuire ran away with the 5000, winning by over 200 meters
    with a 15:07.70 time. Mark Strauss attemped to come back but a sore
    hip limited him to a 16:04.95.
    
    
    
    
    
    The rest of the meet was about relay events. The Sprint Medley
    Relay led off with 200 legs by Gray and Kothari that put MIT well out
    of the hunt. Alan Raphael ran a 52.7 400 leg to make up a few meters
    before he handed off to Seed. Leif ran a 53.6 first 400 to make up
    the entire 30 meters but faded during the final 200 to finish with a
    1:55.0 anchor.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Distance Medley Relay did not go well for MIT but the
    competitive effort was there. Phil Loiselle, coming back from a 10:15
    effort in the Steeplechase, was not able to stay with the leaders in
    the 1200 meter leg, coming through with a 3:26. Sean Montgomery ran a
    50.8 to make up considerable ground, but John Biesiadecki, despite a
    56.9 first 400 finished in 2:05.9 to lose too much ground for Mike
    Parkins to make up in the anchor. Nevertheless Mike ran a 4:35 mile
    to finish off a long day on the track.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the 1600 Relay, Yuval Mazor led off with a 52.9 effort to put
    MIT about 10 meters behind. Karchem made up that ground with a 50.9
    before handing off to Rosenfield, who ran a 51.7. Montgomery, running
    his 3rd event established a 30 meter lead by the 200 mark, finishing
    with a 49.9 to win in 3:25.32.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next Saturday the team will be in San Diego to compete at the UCSD
    Invitational.

    **MIT SETS NUMEROUS QUALIFYING MARKS IN UCSD
    INVITE**
    
    
    
    **Leif Seed Run 1:52.72 To Qualify For
    Nationals**
    
    
    
    
    
    March 27, 1999
    
    
    
    
    
    Getting the type of weather they had been hoping for, MIT's Men's
    Track Team took advantage of the opportunity at the USCD
    Invitational, and qualified numerous individuals for the New England
    Division III Championships.
    
    
    
    
    
    Leading the way for qualifiers was Leif Seed, who two years ago
    set personal bests in the Steeplechase, 1500, and a 400 leg in the
    1600 Relay. Leif continued his string of successes with a huge best
    in the 800, winning the Invitational in 1:52.72. In the same race
    Sean Montgomery continued his comeback from his broken toe with a
    1:56.22 effort. Also in the 800 and setting personal bests were Alan
    Raphael, with a 2:01.69 and Gus Blomquist, running a 2:04.62.  
    
    
    
    
    
    A few hours later Leif and Sean returned to run the 1500. Mark
    Hauser, who placed 3rd at the Division I Indoor Nationals, was also
    in the race. Both Leif and Sean had been told of Hauser's attendance,
    but they either forgot or decided they were on a roll and they should
    milk it for everything it was worth. The 400 was in 58 and they were
    right there. The 800 was in 2:00 and they were right there. The 1200
    was in 3:01 and they were not there. Leif came back to run a
    respectable 3:59.62, but Sean faded to a 4:06.46.
    
    
    
    
    
    Approximately 20 minutes later, the 1600 Relay was starting with
    Leif running 2nd leg and Sean running anchor. Expectations were low
    due to the severe oxygen debt suffered by both athletes, but the need
    to discover what the two had in clutch situations was paramount. Todd
    Rosenfield, who earlier had run a PR of 50.96 in the open 400, opened
    with a 51.5 leadoff. Leif was next and rose to the occasion with a PR
    split of 50.1. Neal Karchem, who ran a 51.5 in the open 400, ran a
    great leg in 50.8 to put MIT in a tie for 1st place going into the
    exchange zone. Either Neal slowed slightly at handoff, Sean left a
    split second too soon, or a combination of both because the initial
    handoff was missed. Sean slowed to a stop, allowing the other team to
    open up a 15 meter lead. Sean finished with a 52.1 (not too bad after
    a complete stop once the watch had started) and a cumulative best of
    3:24.52.
    
    
    
    
    
    Ravi Sastry made a successful return to competition with a 21-10
    1/4 leap in the Long Jump, a 15.35 in the 110HH into a headwind, and
    a 11.60 in the 100, which was also run into the wind.
    
    
    
    
    
    After a difficult week training for the decathlon, both Jordan
    Alperin and Peter Bluvas has good days on the track and in the field.
    Jordan ran 16.20 in the High Hurdles to qualify for the NE Div. 3
    Meet, ran 59.54 in the 400IH, high jumped 6-0 3/4, and long jumped
    19-2 1/2. Peter ran 16.32 in the highs, 60.61 in the intermediates,
    threw 104-8 in his second effort with the Hammer, 97-8 in his second
    effort in the Discus, and 38-0 1/4 in the Shot to round out a very
    full day of competition.
    
    
    
    
    
    In addition to Leif winning the 800, Chris McGuire won the 10K on
    Friday with a first time effort of 31:48.39 in a great race against a
    trio of UCSD runners. Chris came back in the 5000 on Saturday but due
    to sore calves could only manage a 15:43.9.
    
    
    
    
    
    Mark Strauss ran his second 9:27 effort in the Steeplechase in as
    many outings to place 2nd in the Invitational field. Mike Parkins,
    feeling the effects of a cold, only ran 9:53.45. Phil Loiselle, who
    started out to fast and later took a header into the water jump,
    finished in 10:22.62.
    
    
    
    
    
    The pole vaulters were separated into open and invitational
    sections, but both did well. Sam Thibault vaulted 13-5 1/4 and Matt
    Potts leaped 12-11 1/2 to miss NE Div. 3 qualifying by 1/2 inch.
    
    
    
    
    
    Other personal and season bests were set by Jason Dailey in the
    Hammer with a 144-0 effort, Roger Nielsen with 60.15 in the 400IH,
    and the 400 Relay team of Robbie Gray, Karchem, Rosenfield, and
    Montgomery running 44.43.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT is at WPI on April 3 to try and regain the Engineer's Cup
    after losing it for the first time last year to RPI.
