    BATES AND COAST GUARD</span></strong></p>

  <p align="left">MIT had not lost a regular season meet to Bates since 1983
    and it has been even longer since the Engineers have lost to the Coast Guard
    Academy.&nbsp; <a href="tri.res.html">The
    meet </a>took place at the Coast Guard Academy's 180 meter track in New London,
    CT.&nbsp; Bates gave MIT a difficult time through the early part of the meet
    before MIT turned on the competitive spirit and pulled away, winning the
    meet 160 to 98 for Bates and 96 for Coast Guard.</p>
  <p align="left">The meet opened up with the field events (35lb. weight throw,
    long jump, high jump, pole vault).&nbsp; The first event to have the results
    in was the long jump.&nbsp; The gravity must have been turned up in New London
    because no one seemed able to jump very far and only Macbeth of Bates was
    able to come close to 20'.&nbsp; MIT secured&nbsp; the 3-4-5 spots to stay
    close to Bates' 1-2 finish using the 7-5-4-3-2-1 scoring system.&nbsp; The
    weight throw, won by Uzoma Orji with a toss of 60-9 1/2, also went to Bates
    as their 2-3 finish outscored MIT's 1-6 finish by one point.&nbsp; The high
    jump, a miserable event for MIT the past two years, favored Bates and Coast
    Guard.&nbsp; MIT managed a sixth place from Chris Bateman while Bates picked
    up nine points for second and third places.&nbsp; MIT was behind by a score
    of 30-18 at this point in the meet.&nbsp; In the pole vault, MIT turned things
    around a bit when Patrick Barragan made his season debut with a 11-5 3/4
    effort, joining Omari Stephens and Nate Ball, who took the top two places
    at 13-5 1/4 and 15-6 1/4 respectively.&nbsp; Bates
    earned fourth and sixth places as MIT gained 10 points on the Bobcats.</p>
  <p align="left">On the track, the first event was the mile run.&nbsp; After
    an initial battle with runners from Coast Guard, Fivos Constantinou, Jake
    Ruzevick and Eric Khatchadourian took control and raced to a 1-2-3 victory
    with Bates settling for a 4-5 finish.&nbsp; Constantinou, who had given up
    in the middle of the race, surged at the end to win in 4:25.01, just edging
    out Ruzevick.&nbsp; MIT had now pulled ahead 48 to 39. </p>
  <p align="left">In the 55HH,  Stephens joined with Anthony Teixeira and Thad
    Wozniak to place 2-4-5 while Bates placed first only.&nbsp; MIT continued
    to pull ahead, now leading 58 to 46.</p>
  <p align="left">The 400 and 600 meter events  barely went in MIT's favor.&nbsp; In
    the 400, Bates ran away with a 1-2 finish while MIT suffered a poor outing,
    only placing 3-4.&nbsp; However, in the 600, Dan Rodgers remained undefeated
    by winning in 1:26.34.&nbsp; Dave Reshef supported Rodgers' effort with a
    fourth place finish out of the slow section while Bates settled for third.&nbsp;The
    two events went to MIT 17-16, giving MIT an overall lead 75 to 62. </p>
  <p align="left">The triple jump and shot put were finishing up about this time
    and also helped MIT's cause.&nbsp; Orji's expected victory, was made sweeter
    by the fact that he threw his season best of 58-9 1/4 as he continues to
    lead the country for Division III athletes.&nbsp; Freshman,
    James Oleinik, continued to surprise as he blasted a 47-3 3/4 put to claim
    second place and give MIT 12 more points.&nbsp; Bates had to settle for five
    points and a 87 to 67 point deficit.&nbsp; The triple jump saw Teixeira come
    back at the end of the event to claim second place to lead Bateman and Stephens,
    who placed fourth and fifth respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventhough Drabo of
    Bates won the event, MIT outscored the Bobcats 10-8.</p>
  <p align="left">With the meet pretty well in hand, MIT's middle-distance runners
    went back to the track.&nbsp; Constantinou led from the gun in the 800 with
    a 2:02.20 victory.&nbsp; Matt Bieniosek assisted with a third place.&nbsp; The
    next event, the 1000, was won by All America runner, Mike Flint of the Coast
    Guard Academy in 2:33.12 but MIT managed 2-3-4, led by Ruzevick in 2:37.83.</p>
  <p align="left">David Blau won his two events quite easily.&nbsp; In the 55
    he won by .23 in 6.69.&nbsp; Drawing lane six in the 200, Blau ran start
    to finish without ever seeing an opponent, winning in 23.14.&nbsp; Blau's
    closest competitor was teammate Wozniak in 23.93.</p>
  <p align="left">In the final individual event of the day, Trevor Rundell and
    Chris Bruce allowed Jeremy Yandell to do most of the work before taking the
    lead with about 800 meters to go.&nbsp; Rundell pulled away in the final
    laps, running 9:02.38 to Bruce's 9:05.61.</p>
  <p align="left">While MIT looked horrible in the 4x400 relay and did not place,
    they put in a valiant effort in the 4x800.&nbsp; Bieniosek led off with a
    fine 2:03.6 leg to give MIT the lead.&nbsp; Yermie Cohen found his comfort
    zone and ran a fine 2:01.3 to open up the lead.&nbsp; John McGonagle, running
    the 800 for the first time, went out well in 62, but faded in the end to
    give up the lead to Coast Guard.&nbsp; Dave Reshef made a great effort to
    make up the difference, bringing everyone at the meet to their feet before
    running out of gas in the final 150, allowing Coast Guard the event victory.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT will face a much stiffer challenge in defending
    New England Division III champions, Williams College on their home track.&nbsp; RPI
    will join the mix and add another difficult challenge.&nbsp; Westfield State,
    boasting very few athletes will not likely be a factor  in the team scoring
    even though they have some impressive individuals.</p>
