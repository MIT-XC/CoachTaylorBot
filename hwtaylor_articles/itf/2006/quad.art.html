  <p><strong><span class="style1">MIT BOWS TO WILLIAMS, FINISHING
    SECOND IN <a href="quad.res.html">4-WAY MEET</a></span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 21, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">Despite the fact that this is  the weakest MIT team
    in many years, remaining undefeated seemed a real possibility for the Engineers
    as they took their 2-0 record to Williamstown to face Williams, RPI and Westfield
    State.&nbsp; Showing no fear of the heavily favored Ephs from Williams, MIT
    maintained the lead until three events to go when the strength of Williams
    finally prevailed.&nbsp; Williams
    finished with 207 points to MIT's 192.&nbsp; Both teams far outdistanced
    the larger team from RPI, finishing with a score of 109 as well as the Owls
    from Westfield State, finishing with 90 points. </p>
  <p align="left">Tech came ready to compete despite their small numbers, bringing
    only 29 competitors to the meet.&nbsp; MIT was led by Omari Stephens with
    19 points.&nbsp; The scoring in the four-way meet was 9 points for first
    and 7-6-5-4-3-2-1 for second through eighth places.&nbsp; In addition to
    winning the 55HH in a personal best of 8.15 in the trials and 8.17 in the
    finals, the sophomore claimed second in the pole vault at 13-5 3/4 and sixth
    in the triple jump with a&nbsp; leap
    of 40-2 3/4.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">As expected, Uzoma Orji won his two events, remaining undefeated
    for the season.&nbsp; In the shot put, Orji threw 56-8 3/4 and followed that
    up with a facility record of 62-3 3/4 in the weight throw.&nbsp; In the shot
    put, Orji was supported by freshman standout, James Oleinik, who threw a
    personal best of 47-10.</p>
  <p align="left">Nate Ball also remained undefeated, claiming first in the pole
    vault, clearing a season best of 15-9.&nbsp; Ball narrowly missed 16-3 1/2
    on his final attempt.&nbsp; The vault is MIT's strongest event this season,
    scoring 39 of a possible 55 points.&nbsp; Supporting Ball and Stephens were
    Patrick Barragan and Nate Sharpe, earning seventh and eighth places respectively.</p>
  <p align="left">The only other victory for MIT was run by Eric Khatchadourian,
    who took the 3000 from gun to finish line on the undersized, flat track.&nbsp; Khatchadourian
    ran 9:00.07 to win by a little less than one second.&nbsp; MIT scored well
    in this event, getting season bests from Joe Roy-Mayhew, Tyler Abrams and
    Chris Wong as they placed third, sixth and eighth respectively.</p>
  <p align="left">Freshman stalwart, Jake Ruzevick, did not win any races, but
    ran an outstanding triple, placing second each time as he ran indoor personal
    bests in the mile (4:25.06) and the 800 (1:58.42) and anchored the 4x800
    relay with a 1:58.9 leg.&nbsp; Fivos Constantinou, normally right with or
    just ahead of Ruzevick, was unable to compete due to a sore hamstring. &nbsp;Nevertheless,
    Ruzevick was supported well by his teammates.&nbsp; In the mile, Chris Bruce
    ran 4:31.82 to place fifth and Trevor Rundell ran 4:37.28 to finish seventh.&nbsp; In
    the 800, Dan Rodgers ran a season best of 2:01.17, earning third place and
    Dave Reshef placed fifth in 2:04.66.&nbsp; The 4x800 relay, running to win,
    and set a freshman record, was poorly run despite Ruzevick's efforts.&nbsp; The
    first three legs, ran an abysmal 6:17, averaging over 2:05 each.</p>
  <p align="left">Also having outstanding performances in the jumps were; Anthony
    Teixeira, jumping well and placing third in the triple jump with a leap of
    41-11 1/2, Chris Bateman in the long jump with a fifth place effort of 20-0
    1/2 and Obinna Anyanwu with a huge personal best in the long jump of 19-11
    3/4.</p>
  <p align="left">On the track, outstanding performances were turned in by David
    Blau with a 6.64 in the 55 dash, Aron Walker, who ran 1:26.92 in the 600
    and Alex Rothberg in the 400 with a second place time of 53.86.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT travels north to Bowdoin College for&nbsp;a
    1:00 start against Bowdoin, Springfield and Tufts.&nbsp; Tech will be looking
    forward to getting back on a 200 meter track after two consecutive meets
    on small tracks. </p>
