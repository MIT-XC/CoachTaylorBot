  <p><strong><span class="style1">MIT MEN RUN AWAY WITH COMPETITION TO PUT RECORD
        AT 9-1 </span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 28, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">MIT men's track and field team traveled to Brunswick, Maine
    on Saturday to face host <a href="bowdoin.res.html">Bowdoin College, Colby
    College, Gordon College, Springfield College and Tufts University</a>.&nbsp; Tufts
    was favored in the meet based on the seeds but did not to seem to have the
    energy necessary to overcome the Engineers, who were anxious to finally run
    on a 200 meter track and show they could run, throw and jump with the best
    in New England Division III.&nbsp; MIT pulled ahead late in the meet, dominating
    the last of the field events to beat Tufts by a score of 184 to 156. &nbsp;&nbsp; Bowdoin
    College followed in the scoring with 98 points, just ahead of Springfield.&nbsp; Colby
    trailed with 20 points while Gordon failed to score.&nbsp; Only six places
    were awarded points using the 10-8-6-4-2-1 scoring format for meets with
    five or more teams.</p>
  <p align="left">All the squads seemed to have left good individuals out of
    the meet.&nbsp; For Tufts a few of their top distance runners had run at
    a large invitational the night before, and for MIT, Nate Ball, New England's
    premier vaulter, was at the pole vault summit in Reno, Nevada.&nbsp; The
    determined team from Tech started off well in the first events.&nbsp; In
    the trials for the 55HH, Omari Stephens ran a personal best of 8.10.&nbsp; David
    Blau followed that up in the 55 dash trials by running the fastest qualifying
    time of 6.71.&nbsp; In the finals, both lived to up to expectation.&nbsp; Stephens
    narrowly missed the victory, running another PR of 8.09 to Bowdoin College's
    Joe Adu in 8.08.&nbsp; In the process, Stephens upset the top seeded hurdler
    from Tufts, who finished third.&nbsp; Blau left nothing to chance, winning
    in 6.63.</p>
  <p align="left">In the first oval event, Jake Ruzevick took the pace out in
    the mile.&nbsp; His early splits of 64 and 2:08 strung out the field, with
    teammates Fivos Constantinou running right with him, and Yermie Cohen running
    a few seconds off the pace.&nbsp; The pace dragged a bit in the third quarter,
    slowing to 3:15.&nbsp; Owen McKenna of Bowdoin pulled ahead and ran to an
    easy victory in 4:16.64.&nbsp; Ruzevick set a personal best, placing second
    in 4:19.78.&nbsp; Constantinou and Cohen ran season bests to place 3rd and
    4th respectively with times of 4:21.07 and 4:29.97.&nbsp; MIT outscored Tufts
    18 to two.&nbsp; This momentum affected the rest of the team as 42 personal
    or seasonal bests were set.</p>
  <p align="left">In the field events, Anthony Teixeira continued to improve
    in his specialty, the triple jump.&nbsp;&quot;Tex&quot; jumped 43-0 1/2 to place fourth
    and break up a very good jumping squad from Tufts.&nbsp; Stephens lent a
    hand here as well, jumping a best of 41-4 1/2 to place sixth.&nbsp; Tufts
    outscored MIT 18-5 in the event but Coach Taylor of MIT expected much worse.
   &nbsp; Uzoma Orji did not have his best day in the weight throw but still
   managed to win by over four feet, throwing 61-1 1/2.&nbsp; Tufts countered
   in the high jump, sweeping the first three places as well as fifth to garner
   26 points to MIT's 0.</p>
  <p align="left">Back on the track, MIT tried to dig out of the whole.&nbsp; Not
    expecting, but hoping to score in the 400, Alex Rothberg ran a personal best
    of 52.54 to place fourth.&nbsp; Even though Tufts scored 12 points to MIT's
    four, it could have been much worse.&nbsp; In the 600, freshman Dan Rodgers
    held off a Tufts runner down the stretch to win in 1:24.58.&nbsp;Rodgers
    was supported by Aron Walker, running 1:26.68 for fifth place.</p>
  <p align="left">In the 800, Constantinou doubled back, took the pace out aggressively
    in 58 for the first 400, but tied up in the final 300, getting overtaken
    by a runner from Tufts and Colby and settling for third.&nbsp; Matt Bieniosek
    ran a personal best of 2:01.02, placing fifth by .01 seconds.&nbsp; Tufts
    came out on top due to the event win, 10-8.&nbsp; The 1000 was next and Ruzevick
    went out with a vengeance.&nbsp; He ran 2:01 through the 800, holding off
    Mahoney from Tufts until the final lap.&nbsp; Ruzevick settled for a very
    fast second place of 2:32.24.&nbsp; Cohen showed he is coming around to top
    form as he placed fourth in 2:36.89.&nbsp; MIT came out with a slight edge
    over Tufts 12-10.</p>
  <p align="left">David Blau got back on the track in the 200 meter dash.&nbsp; Blau
    won easily, running a season best of 22.83.&nbsp; Thad Wozniak ran a season
    best of 23.64 to place sixth and give MIT another one point edge over Tufts.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">Finally, the distance events were coming up and MIT was up
    to the task.&nbsp; In the 3000, Bowdoin placed first and second by out kicking
    the front running tandem of Chris Bruce and Joe Roy-Mayhew, who place third
    and fourth with personal bests of 8:57.64 and 9:00.33.&nbsp; Immediately
    following the 3000, the runners took to the track in the 5000.&nbsp; Eric
    Khatchadourian and Trevor Rundell took the lead and pushed the pace, but
    this time they would not be caught.&nbsp; Rundell ran a huge personal best
    of 15:25.95.&nbsp; Khatchadourian, doing all the work early in the race,
    faded a little in the end but still ran 15:34.07 for second.&nbsp; Chris
    Wong was back to his old form, placing fourth in 15:44.82 and Spencer Dudley
    ran a personal best of 15:51.98 to give MIT 23 points in the event.</p>
  <p align="left">On the infield, the throwers and jumpers were taking care of
    business.&nbsp; In the long jump, another event MIT figured to lose.&nbsp; Tufts
    jumpers managed the win and a sixth place, but MIT came through big for third
    through fifth to score 12 big points.&nbsp; Orji and outstanding freshman,
    James Oleinik placed first and third, throwing season bests of 59-4 and 47-11
    1/4 respectively.&nbsp; Springfield throwers came through, holding Tufts
    to zero points.&nbsp; Finally, in the pole vault, despite the absence of
    Ball, Stephens and Barragan managed first and fifth to Tufts second.&nbsp; Stephens
    joined MIT's top ten list for indoor vaults with his personal best of 14-0
    1/2.</p>
  <p align="left">The &quot;team effort&quot; could not have been better.&nbsp; This
    meet marked the end of MIT's regular season competition against division
    III opponents. &nbsp; Next week (2/6) MIT goes across the river to Boston
    University to take on division I teams BU, Boston College, Northeastern University
    and Providence College.</p>
