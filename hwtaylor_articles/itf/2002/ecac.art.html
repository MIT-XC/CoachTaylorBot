NATIONALS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>March 1-2, 2002</P>

<P>MIT Men's Track and Field team went through their final tune-up
prior to the NCAA Division III Championship to be held next weekend
when they went to Tufts University for the ECAC Division III
Championship.</P>

<P>The ECAC Division III Championship has a unique position in track
and field. The placement of the championship, one week after a much
more challenging All New England Championship, and one week before
Nationals, guarantees that most teams are not going to treat it as a
championship but more as a last chance qualifier and final tune-up.
There are a few schools who take advantage of the opportunity and go
for the championship team title. On the other end of the spectrum,
there are some colleges that are denying athletes the right to
participate in these championships unless they have the ability to
advance to the Nationals the week after.</P>

<P>Preferring to prepare for the short outdoor season, MIT only
entered the individuals who either were trying to qualify for
nationals or who already had and were just staying sharp. Sean
Montgomery, Sean Nolan, and Dan Feldman, qualifiers in the 1500, 5000
and 5000 respectively, rested their legs and did not race at all.</P>

<P>Justifying the team's philosophy, Nathan Ball set the freshman
record in the Pole Vault with a 15-1 effort, which also provisionally
qualified him for the NCAA Championship. "Although it will take a
vault of at least 15-6 to make Nationals, it was nice for Nathan to
get over the 15' indoor barrier," said an enthusiastic Coach
Taylor.</P>

<P>On Friday, Craig Mielcarz could not get into the rhythm in the
High Jump. Although he jumped 6-9 in practice and nearly cleared 6-11
earlier in the week, Craig was unable to go beyond 6-7 in the
competition. Craig's season best of 6-8 3/4 may be enough to get him
to Nationals.</P>

<P>In the 400, Yuval Mazor looked ready to run the 400 leg in the DMR
at Nationals, as he ran a 50.85. Jesse Alejandro, coming back from a
suspected strep throat, ran the 500 but developed a blister early in
the race and ran cautiously so as not to risk any further disruptions
in training, finishing in 1:10.73. In the 800, Mark Jeunnette showed
he is ready as an alternate in the DMR with a season best of 1:56.95.
Brian Anderson went out strong, coming through the 600 in 1:22, but
faded a bit to finish in 1:54.72.</P>

<P>The team competes in Ada, Ohio at Ohio Northern University on
Friday and Saturday, March 8-9.</P>
