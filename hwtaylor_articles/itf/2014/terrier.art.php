              <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Track &amp; Field Breaks Out With Record Performances</span></p>
              <p align="left">January 24-25, 2014</p>
              <p align="left">The MIT Track &amp; Field team split up this weekend, sending folks to three different meets. A group of multi-event athletes traveled to <a href="http://www.tfrrs.org/results/32359_2003567.html?athlete_hnd=3255522">Harvard</a> where the women competed in the pentathlon on Saturday and the men in the Heptathlon on both Friday and Saturday. The oval runners (200 and up) as well as a few high level vaulters and throwers went to Boston University where the women competed on Friday, with the exception of the DMR on Saturday morning, and the men competed on Saturday at the <a href="http://www.lancertiming.com/results/winter14/BUTerrier/">John Thomas Invitational</a>. Most of the field event athletes, as well as the sprinters and hurdlers were competing at <a href="artfarnham.res.pdf">MIT's Art Farnham Invitational</a> on Saturday, a meet that was dedicated on Saturday to the former MIT Head Track &amp; Field and Cross Country Coach, who ran the show from 1957-1973.</p>
              <p align="left">Friday's competition was just outstanding. It was obvious the Engineers were ready and waiting for the level of competition. Isabella Stuopis '16 started things off with the Shot Put, and of course, as she has done the past two weeks, she reset her own varsity record. Throwing 43-9 3/4 on her final throw in the trials, she finished eighth overall as she was unable to produce a better throw in the finals.</p>
              <p align="left">The Mile Run was the event of the day for Tech. Louise van den Heuvel '14 led things off, running in the fast section, immediately after Mary Cain ran the second fastest junior time ever and Abby D'gostino ran the third fastest collegiate time ever. The pace was fast but van den Heuvel ran her race, splitting 71, 2:23 and 3:37 as she fatigued a bit at the end to finish in a personal best 4:52.35. In the next section, Maryann Gong '17 was racing with a group that took the pace out much slower, which was to Gong's advantage. Gong split 72, 2:26 and 3:41 as she settled in second place. As she was about to make her move she was passed unexpectedly. She kept up but could not quite pass the leader, splitting 71 for the final quarter, running 4:52.39. She and van den Heuvel are currently ranked the top two in the country for Division III. Christine Wicker '17 ran an excellent race as well. She split 77, 2:33 and 3:52 as she was too cautious, and sat on the leader instead of taking the lead with 600 to go when the pace had slowed. She eventually took off with 250 to go, running 71 on the final quarter to total 5:05.08 in the section win. Nicole Zeinstra '16, finally able to race after a long bout with an injury, is still not up to full speed as yet. However, she raced as if she had never been out, running with the leader through splits of 75 and 2:32 before the fatigue started getting to her. Nevertheless she continued to race hard, ending up with a strong performance of 5:09.65. Nadia Lucas '17 ran an outstanding race, but was a bit too overzealous with the pace. After coming through in a strong 74, Lucas decided she felt good enough to take the lead. She was able to hold on through 800 in 2:32,  then faded big, but kept racing to the best of her ability, finishing in 5:20.33. Both van den Heuvel's and Gong's time should get them into the NCAA Division III Indoor Championship in March.</p>
              <p align="left">Cimmy Virdi '16 bettered her indoor Pole Vault mark by nearly a half foot as she cleared 12-5 1/2 and almost cleared 13'. This should certainly get her to the NCAA Division III Championship as she is currently tied for second on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 400, Kendra Knittel '17 began her long day with an excellent 59.29 performance. Stephanie Guo '17 ran a 60.10 after going out a little too hard in 27.7. Both times are indoor PR's. The duo came back later in the 200 and the 4x400. In the 200 Knittel ran an indoor best of 26.46 while Guo equaled her 400 split of 27.71. Jackie Brew '14, improved her season best to 26.03, which moved her to 15th on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p align="left">The 800 brought out two more indoor PR's from the Engineers. Cindy Huang '15 ran a very well paced race, splitting 33-34 for each lap to finish in 2:15.54 to move her to 5th in the NCAA rankings. Alexandra Shade '17, still coming back from injury and getting accustomed to indoor track ran a cautious 2:23.54.</p>
              <p align="left">Isabel Crystal '16 was a little ambitious in the 500, taking the lead and splitting 29.0 for the first 200. She settled in, hitting the 400 at 62.6, but then paid for her first 200 with a 20 second final 100 to finish in 1:22.11, still a personal best.</p>
              <p align="left">The 4x400 team of Brew, Guo, Shade and Knittel far outdid expectations, winning their section in 3:59.28. Brew led off with an excellent 58.9 to give the team the lead. Guo made a great handoff and paced a great leg, retaking the lead at the end to split 59.8. Shade was the biggest surprise as she split 60.6 giving Knittel a lead, which she proceeded to expand with a 59.9 anchor for the win.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event for the women on Friday was the 5K. Shivani Kaushal '15 was up first. Running an aggressive pace, Kaushal ran mile splits of 5:47, 5:57 and 6:06 as she started fading at the end. She fought through the pain better than ever before, closing with a 42 final 200 for a PR of 18:32.46. Heather Sweeney '16 was up next. Her pace was a bit more even due to the pace established by the slower section. Her mile splits were 5:55, 5:59 and 6:02 before kicking in with a 39 final 200 for a huge PR 18:35.57.</p>
              <p align="left">The women ended competition on Saturday morning with the Distance Medley Relay. Based on the previous days results, running sub 11:50 was the goal. Gong, although she slowed after a 34 first 200, still did her part with a 3:38.5, but did have too much left. Knittel had a great handoff, but did not get out fast enough, splitting the 200 in 29.1 as compared to her 27.9 in the open 400. Handing off in 61.1, the race was now between MIT and Monmouth. Huang took over for the 800 leg and looked great through the 400 where she came through in 67.0. However, her last 400 was a 73.9 giving her a 2:20.9 split. van den Heuvel was about 40 meters down at the handoff so making up the difference was not out of the question. However, when she did not make up much of the gap in the first 800 with a 2:27 split, she seemed to lose a little focus. Although she finished with a 5:02, she was far off of her 4:52 from the night before. The total time of 12:02.67 was a fine time for mid-season, but certainly no where near what is expected for a team that hopes to compete at the NCAA Championship. Nevertheless, since it is early in the season, this time is number one on the NCAA Division III list.</p>
              <p align="left">The men began the competition with the slow section of the 5K. Matt Jordan '15 ran an awesome race with the only error being not taking the lead sooner. His first 1600 was 4:47 and right on the planned pace. His second 1600 was 4:51, slowing about a second per quarter. His third 1600 was a 4:48 thanks mostly to a 69 final 400 before closing the race out with a 31 200 for a 14:58.04 PR. Later in the evening, Benji Xie '15 took to the track and got back on the proverbial horse. After a number of races where he had difficulty finding his competitive niche, he certainly found it today. Running a solid 71-72 pace the entire way, Xie ran 14:52.51. Xie and Jordan are ranked 9th and 12th at this time on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT assaulted the 400. States Lee '16 unleashed a brilliant move entering the second 200 to take the lead. Although he died in the final straight, he still ran an indoor best 48.98 to move him into a tie for 3rd on the national list. Shortly afterwards, Derek Barnes '16 did his best to run faster than Lee, but that was not to be, although he did set an indoor PR of 49.25, good for 9th on the NCAA list. Tyler Singer-Clark '14 ran very close to his personal best, clocking 49.54 for his first 400 of the year and good for 16th on the national ranking. Nick Diamantoni '15, who has been trying to break the 50 second barrier, both indoors and outdoors, ran a great race, making his goal by the smallest of margins, running 49.99 to move into 10th place on the MIT indoor all-time list. Michael Kaba '16, who had earlier run the 60HH in 9.10, did not get out in the race and soon lost interest when he fell behind. Nevertheless he ran 50.63. Danny Newman '17 ran 52.16 and Brandon Corts '17 ran 52.68, both were personal bests for indoors.</p>
              <p align="left">Harrison Hunter '15 won his section of the 800 and established a new PR in the process, running 1:54.45. Chadd Kiggins '15, stayed too far back  throughout his race and had too much to make up at the end, running 1:54.96, a season best nonetheless. Andrew Mullen '17, still trying to find his competitiveness, also hung in the back, overly concerned with dying in the race even though he split 57.4 for the 400. His final 400 was 60.7 giving him a final time of 1:58.16. Dominique Hoskin '15 had similar concerns and results, performing 2:01.73. Hunter and Kiggins moved to 5th and 8th in the NCAA rankings.</p>
              <p align="left">The Mile Run went well for Tech, but there were errors made by all of the Engineers. Justin Bullock '14 did an amazing job just getting to the line. Not only are his shins in tremendous pain, but just yesterday he slipped on some ice and a car ran over his leg. Cleared to race, he did just that. A critical mistake early in the race caused a severe loss of time, but he still clocked a 4:18.09. Nick Matthews '17 continued to knock large chunks of time off of his personal best, running 4:20.79. Making the mistake of taking the lead at the beginning and doing nothing with it was a waste of energy and at the end he lengthened his stride in hopes of running faster, which just made it more difficult. All rookie errors that will get fixed in time. There is certainly a lot of potential in Matthews. Ken Leidal '17 went out way too fast, splitting 31 for the first 200 and leading for the first 400. After falling back and splitting a 68 third quarter, Leidal moved again to finish in 4:24.02. Matt McEachern '17 ran 4:25.28. Ian Tolan '16 ran 4:26.76.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 500, both Henry Tareque '17 and Gary Burnett '17 were in the same section. Tareque went out strong, hitting the 200 in 23.9 and taking the lead. He proceeded to a 51.5 400 split en route to an excellent 1:07.12. Burnett did not get out quite as well, but was still competitive, splitting 24.6 and 52.8 on the way to a 1:08.78.</p>
              <p align="left">Most of the top 400 guys returned in the 200. Singer-Clark ran 22.38 for a new personal best and moved to 15th on the NCAA list.. Diamantoni ran a huge personal best, clocking 22.53. Lee ran 22.76 and Barnes 23.05.</p>
              <p align="left">On the field event side of things, Ken Cooper '15 threw 50-0 3/4 in the Shot Put and 54-10 in the Weight Throw, not a good day for the junior. Ben Schreck '15 cleared 14-6 in the Pole Vault by at least two feet, but then was unable to clear 15-0.</p>
              <p align="left">Back on the track, Sam Parker '15 was entered in his first 1000 of the year. With the exception of running on the rail too long and getting caught in traffic, Parker ran an impressive 2:27.99, running 29 point laps the entire race. Hunter, by his own request, came back in the 1000. His first 700 meters looked as though he was contemplating dropping out, but that was just a disguise as he owned the race from the back. When he went, he really went, dropping a 56.8 final 400 to finish in 2:30.74. Bullock manned up and ran an excellent second race despite his legs, finishing with a 29 final 200 for a 2:32.02</p>
              <p align="left">The 4x400 was the event most had been waiting for and it was the final event of the meet for MIT. States Lee led off as usual. His first lap was a solid 23.2, but that put him in a tangle with two other runners as they entered the turn. Lee braced himself by putting his hand out and the lead runner went down, causing Lee to break and then hurdle the fallen runner. This certainly hurt Lee's performance significantly as he only split 50.2. Michael Kaba performed much better in the relay than in the open 400, moving when he needed to in order to stay ahead of opposing runners and timing his break correctly. His 49.6 split was excellent and his handoff to Derek Barnes, while not perfect was the best they ever had. Barnes ran very well, accelerating when he needed to in order to hold off pass attempts. His split of 49.7 was his best indoor split ever, but still not faster than his open 400. Singer-Clark did an excellent job on his anchor leg, pulling away in the final 200 to split 48.7 for a total time of 3:18.13. This time currently has them ranked third in Division III.</p>
              <p align="left">Back at MIT, the competitive highlights were led by Ellen Liverpool '15, who yet again set another PR for the fourth consecutive week. This time breaking the 50' barrier for the first time, a 50-5 1/2 throw, ranking her 23rd on the national list. Angel Echevarria '16 had the most impressive performance on the men's side, popping a 46-3 1/4 PR in the Triple Jump to move him to number six on the NCAA list. Other personal bests for the men were earned by Taylor Njaka '17 in the 60 Meter Dash, running 7.15. Teammate Brad Goldsberry improved his 60 time to 7.36. Njaka also ran a personal best in the 200, clocking 23.40. Ian Perry had an excellent day in the Pole Vault, clearing 13-7 1/4 on his second attempt. In the Weight Throw, both Alex Noakes '16 and Sebastian Santos '17 threw PR's. Noakes threw 46-9 and Santos tossed the weight 42-5 1/4.</p>
              <p align="left">The women had a personal best and a season best from Veronica Szklarzewski '15. She ran 8.08 in the 60 Meter Dash for her second PR in two weeks and a 34-2 3/4 in the Triple Jump for a season best. Stephanie Riocci '16 threw a personal best of 39-8 in the Weight Throw. Abby Klein '14 vaulted 10-11 3/4 for a personal best.</p>
              <p align="left">Over at Harvard, Jackie Konopka '14 put down the leading mark in the country for the Pentathlon, tying her personal best last year with a score of 3453 points. Along the way, she set an MIT record of 5-4 1/2 in the High Jump. Stephanie Birkhimer '14 scored 2682 points, which qualified her for the New England Division III Championship. For the men, Jordan Mizerak '14 scored 4491 points in the Heptathlon to rank 7th in the country and Adrian Samsel '16 scored 4437 to rank him 8th on the NCAA list. </p>
              <p align="left">Next week, the Engineers head across town to Tufts University for their final scoring meet of the regular season. MIT expects stiff competition from Tufts in both the men's and women's meets.</p>
