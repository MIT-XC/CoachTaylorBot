  <p><strong><span class="style1">MIT STARTS THE SEASON WITH VICTORIES
    OVER BATES AND COAST GUARD</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 13, 2007</p>
  <p align="left">The MIT Engineers took advantage of their depth in the horizontal
    jumps and distance events to easily outdistance host Bates College and the
    visiting Coast Guard Academy by a score of 165 to 111 to 88, respectively,
    in the annual <a href="tri.res.html">tri-meet</a>.</p>
  <p align="left">Although six places scored in each non-relay event (7-5-4-3-2-1)
    a given team could not score more than four places due to the rules of the
    meet.&nbsp; Jake Ruzevick (4:23.40) led Yermie Cohen (4:29.36), Joe Roy-Mayhew
    (4:30.92) and Chris Wong (4:31.64) to a 1-2-3-4 sweep in the mile to start
    the running events and Hemu Arumugam (8:59.85) led Johannes Schneider (8:59.89),
    Tyler Abrams (9:01.14), Brian Jacokes (9:10.42) and Kevin DiGenova (9:12.13)
    to a 1-2-3-4-5 sweep in the last event, the 3000, to remove any doubt as
    to the outcome of the meet.</p>
  <p align="left">In the field events, Stephen Morton (20-11 1/4) led Chris Bateman
    (20-05 1/4) and Anthony Teixeira (20-03 1/2) to a 1-2-3 finish in the long
    jump and Bateman (42-04 1/4) turned right around and led Teixeira (42-04),
    Morton (42-01 1/4), and pole vault (14-06) and 55HH winner (8.20), Omari
    Stephens (41-10)  to
    a 2-3-4-5 effort in the triple jump.</p>
  <p align="left">In addition to Stephens the other double winner for MIT was
    freshman Stephen Morton, winner of the 200 as well as the long jump.&nbsp; Other
    winners were Liam Fedus in the 600 (1:24.34) and Matt Bieniosek in the 800
    (1:59.51).  </p>
  <p align="left">It is still early in the season, heavy conditioning is still
    in play, and the jumpers and vaulters are still on a limited approach.&nbsp; This
    combined with the fact that the freshmen are being held back from doing too
    much in the early meets give reason to look forward to the later meets in
    anticipation of significant individual improvement.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week the Engineers are at home against RPI, Westfield
    State and Williams College on Saturday starting at noon time.</p>
