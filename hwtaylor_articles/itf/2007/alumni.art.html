  <p align="left">January 6, 2007</p>
  <p align="left">When a program has All America athletes and national champions,
    inevitably, particularly at MIT, they graduate.&nbsp; Those graduates feel
    the need to come back in the annual <a href="alumni.res.html">MIT Alumni
    vs. Varsity indoor track and field meet</a> and humiliate the current varsity athletes who generally are not
    at the All America level.&nbsp; This desire became a reality on Saturday
    as the &quot;Has-Beens&quot; ran away with the meet by a score of 81 to 41.</p>
  <p align="left">Double winners ruled the day for the Alums.&nbsp; Uzoma Orji
    showed that his skills have not deteriorated despite not practicing as he
    won the weight throw with a 62-3 effort and the shot at 52-11 1/2.&nbsp; Zach
    Traina got pay-back on David Blau for beating him in both the 55 and
    200 in last year's meet, by winning the 55 in 6.62 and the 200 in a very
    impressive 22.64.&nbsp; Ben Schmeckpeper repeated his double win from last
    year by taking the mile in 4:23.50 and the 5000 in 15:19.21.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Other victories by the Alumni were had by Thad Wozniak in the
    long jump (21-2 1/2), Nate Ball in the pole vault (14-6), Craig Mielcarz
    in the high jump (6-2), Rick Rajter in the 55HH (7.99) and the foursome of
    Traina, Blau, Wozniak and Rajter in the 4x200 relay.</p>
  <p align="left">The only events won by the varsity were the triple jump by
    Omari Stephens (42-7), the 400 by William Fedus (51.74) and the 800 by Jake
    Ruzevick (2:00.28).&nbsp; Despite the low score, the varsity performed better
    in nearly every event than in last year's meet.&nbsp; The horizontal jumpers
    are still on a limited approach and sprinters and field event athletes are
    finishing a difficult conditioning period.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Stephens had a very good day by not only winning the triple
    jump but also running 8.31 in the high hurdles and jumping 14-0 in the pole
    vault.&nbsp; All three marks qualify for the New England Division III Championship
    (NED3).&nbsp; Stephen
    Morton had a superb day even though he finished third to Traina and Blau
    in the 55 and second to Traina in the 200.&nbsp; Morton qualified for the
    NED3 meet in both events, setting a new MIT freshman record in the 200 at
    22.78.&nbsp; The previous record had been set on a banked track and was shared
    by Traina and Blau at 22.95.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">Other NED3 qualifiers were Anthony Teixeira in the 55HH, Patrick
    Barragan in the pole vault, James Oleinik in the shot put and Ruzevick in
    the mile.&nbsp; Although none of them qualified, four varsity runners broke
    16:00 in the 5K, led by Chris Wong in 15:45.05.&nbsp; Following Wong were
    Tyler Abrams in 15:49.28, Hemagiri Arumugam in 15:52.56 and Brian Jacokes
    in 15:57.68.</p>
  <p align="left">Although approaching the 40 year mark, Bill Singhose still
    has it.&nbsp; Professor Singhose cleared 14-6 in the pole vault for second
    place, threw the shot 40-8 1/2 for third and 41-3 in the weight throw for
    third.&nbsp; Other Alumni place winners were Ravi Sastry placed second in
    the 55HH, Todd Chamoy second in the weight throw, Carlos Renjifo placed third
    in the mile with a superb kick, Eric Khatchadourian, who will be on the varsity
    team for the outdoor season, placed second in the 5K, Rajter was second in
    the high jump and third in the triple jump and Mielcarz was second in the
    long jump.</p>

    competition against Bates and Coast Guard.</p>
