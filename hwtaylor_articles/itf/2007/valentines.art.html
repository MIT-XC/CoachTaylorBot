    TIMES</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 9-10, 2007</p>
  <p align="left">MIT split their squad up this weekend.&nbsp; Sending some athletes
    to Boston University while most of the team stayed home to compete in MIT's
    Coed Invitational. </p>
  <p align="left">Jake Ruzevick got things started at the <a href="valentines.res.html">Valentine's
      Classic</a>    held on Boston University's banked track with a NCAA provisionally qualifying,
    first time effort in the 5K, crossing the line in 14:49.87.&nbsp; Ruzevick
    ran even split 70 second quarters through 2400 meters before falling to 73
    second pace.&nbsp; Getting accustomed to the longer distance will obviously
    take a little practice, but Ruzevick's time puts him at number 10 on the
    MIT all-time list.</p>
  <p align="left">Joe Roy-Mayhew took to the oval next, running a new personal
    best in the mile run.&nbsp; Running negative splits of 67, 66, 65, 65, Roy-Mayhew
    ran a 4:24.05.</p>
  <p align="left">A trio of MIT runners ran the 800.&nbsp; Matt Bieniosek led
    the way with a new best of 1:57.09.&nbsp; Bill Phipps followed that up with
    his own personal best of 1:58.82 to win his section.&nbsp; Archi Stuk finished
    things up with his own MIT best of 2:01.41</p>
  <p align="left">Stephen Morton, running without blocks and stumbling coming
    out of the final turn, nevertheless lowered his own freshman record in the
    200 to 22.44.&nbsp; The fields were so crowded at BU that they did not allow
    runners to take the time to set up blocks.</p>
  <p align="left">In the field the only MIT competitor was James Oleinik.&nbsp; Competing
    in the shot put    Oleinik set a season best of 48-2 3/4.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">The only event for the men held on Saturday was the distance
    medley relay.&nbsp; MIT's intention was to improve their mark for the NE
    Division III meet next week and to see how some of the guys would compete
    fresh.&nbsp; Yermie Cohen has been having a great season and continued that
    with a very nice 3:09 lead off 1200 leg.&nbsp; Alex Rothberg ran his best
    400 of the season, clocking a 51.3.&nbsp; Peter Mulligan continued to improve
    and get the job done with his personal best 2:00.2 800 split.&nbsp; Hemu
    Arumugam anchored the 10:19.88 relay with an excellent 4:19.1 1600 leg.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week the Engineers travel to Bates for the New England
    Division III Championship.&nbsp; On paper it looks as though Tufts University
    and Williams College will be fighting it out for the overall title while
    MIT will be fighting for third place, but hoping Tufts or Williams drops
    the ball so the Engineers can take advantage of it.</p>
