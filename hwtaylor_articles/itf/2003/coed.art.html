  <p><strong><font size="4">MIT TRACK COMPETES WELL IN COED INVITE</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="4">Top Performers Rest for Division III Championship</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 15, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">Seven men's teams and ten women's teams competed today at the 
    MIT Coed Invitational. There was no score kept, and many teams either sent 
    their best athletes to Boston University to run on the fast banked track, 
    or rested them for next week's New England Division III Championship. However, 
    those who did compete produced some fine performances.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's best results came in the throwing events. In the weight 
    throw, Tech's past and present throwers placed 1-4 and produced two personal 
    bests. Chris Khan won with a throw of 56-0. Assistant coach and alumnus Todd 
    Chamoy threw a personal best of 54-0 1/2 for 2nd. Freshman, Uzoma Orji threw 
    over 52' for the second week in a row for 3rd with 52-4. David Saylor also 
    set a personal best with a throw of 51-5 1/2. In the shot put, it was Orji's 
    turn to take first with a toss of 53-4 1/2. Khan threw for a personal best 
    of 44-3 1/4 for 3rd place. Francisco Cruz had a season best of 41-6 for 6th.</p>
  <p align="left">The next strongest area for the Engineers were the sprints. 
    Zach Traina claimed two first places, running 6.65 in the 55 meter dash and 
    22.95 in the 200. Freshman David Blau did his part by placing 2nd in the 55 
    with a 6.68 and 3rd in the 200 with a 23.53.</p>
  <p align="left">The middle distances went well for MIT even though the performances 
    were not quite at the championship level. In the 800, Steve Stoddard ran a 
    personal indoor best with a 2:00.92 to place 3rd. In the 1500 Steve Maltas 
    ran an outstanding 4:08.07 for the victory. Craig Wildman and David Gray supported 
    Maltas's victory with a 3rd and 4th in 4:09.99 and 4:12.14 respectively, both 
    MIT bests. John Brewer ran a season best with a 4:14.70 to place 6th.</p>
  <p align="left">Ben Schmeckpeper and Sean Nolan returned to active status with 
    an easy 1-2 in the 3000 with times of 8:55.15 and 8:57.22 respectively. Ian 
    Driver made a valiant effort at sub 16:00 pace in the 5000 but went a little 
    overboard with a 15:40 pace. Driver fell off the pace in the final mile but 
    still ran a 16:15.67 for 3rd.</p>
  <p align="left">The only other victory for MIT came in the Distance Medley Relay. 
    Steve Maltas led off with a 3:17 1200. Zach Traina provided a fine 50.8 400 
    leg to put MIT well in the lead. Steve Stoddard added a 2:01 to give the Engineers 
    a good possibility of breaking 10:40. Craig Wildman was a little too anxious 
    and delivered a 62 first 400. Only able to produce quarters of 70, 72 and 
    72 afterwards gave MIT a cumulative time of 10:46.12, the best of the season.</p>
  <p align="left">Taking a rest were pentathletes Craig Mielcarz, Rick Rajter 
    and Tom Hoover. Austin Neudecker and Nate Ball wanted to give their legs another 
    week to heal from minor injuries. Brian Anderson raced over at Boston University 
    and ran the mile in a personal best of 4:12.17 after getting boxed in in the 
    middle of the race.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT plays host to the New England Division III Championship 
    with the pentathlon taking place on Friday at noon and the remainder of the 
    meet starting at 11:00 on Saturday. MIT does not have the necessary balance 
    to be favorites but their senior leadership may overcome the odds and enable 
    them to win their 3rd title in the last four years.</p>
