  <p><strong><font size="4">MIT TAKES FIRST IN TRI-MEET VS. BATES AND COAST GUARD</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="4">Anderson's Double Victory and Orji's and Khan's National 
    Qualifying Marks Lead Way</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 18, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">Brian Anderson led the Engineers with two victories in the 1500 
    and 800 as MIT (152.5) downed Bates (104.5) and Coast Guard (92) in a tri-meet 
    hosted by Coast Guard. In a supporting role, many MIT athletes stepped up 
    to do their part. Uzoma Orji again boosted his shot put best as he won the 
    event with a 53-10 1/4. Orji's mark currently lead all Division III national 
    marks and set the MIT varsity record, previously set by John Morefield in 
    1956. Chris Khan made his successful return to competition with a national 
    qualifying mark of 53-6 1/2 in the weight throw, and helped out with a 3rd 
    place effort of 42-6 3/4 in the shot. Craig Mielcarz scored the most points 
    for Tech by winning the long jump with a leap of 21-4 3/4, 2nd in the High 
    Jump (6-5) and another 2nd in the 55HH (8.12 in the trials).</p>
  <p align="left">Many Engineers were on the sidelines nursing minor injuries 
    with hopes they would be ready to go next week when MIT will have to raise 
    the bar on their performances if they hope to defeat Williams College. Zach 
    Traina, who won the 55 dash, was hampered by an adductor muscle strain and 
    did not run the 200. Brian Hoying, a major threat for MIT in the jumps and 
    400 is resting a strained hamstring. Rick Rajter competed, but a pinched nerve 
    prevented him from doing well. Sean Nolan, bothered by a foot injury, rested 
    when it was clear his teammates did not need his services. Freshmen distance 
    runners, Steve Maltas and Fivos Constantinou had to sit so as not to risk 
    further injury. There is no question MIT will need these guys if they hope 
    to win the next two meets.</p>
  <p align="left">On the positive side, Nate Ball returned to competition with 
    a 14-6 effort in the pole vault and showed he is very close to clearing 15' 
    again. Tom Hoover showed some of last year's form with a leap of 21-4 3/4 
    in the long jump (losing out to Mielcarz by virtue of the 2nd best jump), 
    clearing 5-9 in the high jump and placing 5th in the 400 and 3rd in the 200.</p>
  <p align="left">Additional winning efforts came from three other techmen. Craig 
    Wildman in the 3000 with a personal best of 9:03.0. David Blau took advantage 
    of Traina's absence to win the 200 in a best of 24.08. Austin Neudecker, expected 
    to win the triple jump, did just that with a 43-4 1/2 performance.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, in addition to Williams visiting MIT, RPI and Westfield 
    State will join to make a very interesting quad-meet in Cambridge. The men 
    will begin competition at 12:00, while the women will start their meet at 
    3:30.</p>
