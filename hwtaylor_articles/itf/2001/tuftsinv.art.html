<P>February 3, 2001</P>

<P>MIT Men's Track and Field traveled to Tufts University to do
battle with eight other teams, two of which (College of New Jersey
and Ithaca College) traveled a great distance to test New England
track and field. New England was represented by Amherst College,
Springfield College, Trinity College, Tufts University, WPI, and
Wesleyan University. MIT was the only undefeated men's team at Tuft's
2 year old track at the Gantcher Center, and still is after a close
competition with College of New Jersey (CNJ) 189 to 156. Springfield
was third with 130 points after scoring 18 in the last event, the
triple jump. The remaining order of teams was Tufts with 86, Ithaca
with 70, Trinity with 42, Amherst with 32, WPI scoring 21 and
Wesleyan bringing up the rear with 9 points. Scoring in each of the
events went 8 deep with points being awarded in the following order;
10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 in all events.</P>

<P>What was originally scheduled as a five team regular meet, turned
into an invitational with Tufts adding teams at the last minute
without any consultation with opposing coaches, making it near
impossible to plan very well for winning the meet. MIT put their best
foot forward even though they were 23 point underdogs according to
the seeds submitted by the coaches. Not only were the Engineers
expected to lose to their New Jersey opponents, they were going into
battle with a very sick Sean Montgomery, who was favored to win the
800, score high in the 1500, and give the 1600 Relay team a chance in
this event where they were seeded sixth. Rick Rajter, expected to
place 4th in the Triple Jump had to be pulled out of competition
before that event due to an injured foot. The team was in good
spirits but a victory did not seem likely.</P>

<P>Brian Wong threw well in the first event (51-3 3/4), the 35lb.
Weight Throw, but only earned a third place instead of his favored
second place. CNJ scored 15 points to MIT's 6. The other field event
starting at 11:00 for the men was the high jump. Going against two
jumpers from Springfield who have jumped 6-6 and 6-5 respectively,
MIT expected to have a difficult time taking advantage of CNJ not
having much in this event. Brian Hoying jumped well, clearing a
season best of 6-6 3/4 to win the event. Craig Mielcarz, also
clearing 6-6 3/4, finished second on misses. Rajter cleared a
personal best 6-4 3/4 to gain a surprising 4th place. CNJ only
garnered 1 point to help MIT take an early lead.</P>

<P>The first running event final was the 5000. CNJ was favored to
score 12 points to MIT's 0. Tech put distance star, Dan Feldman, in
shorter events to hope for greater point production, which left Ed
Keehr, Liyan Guo, and Albert Liu to take care of business. Ed wasted
no time, going out with the leaders right at the start. Guo and Liu
hung back a little but still in scoring position. Things only got
better. Ed finished with an indoor PR of 15:18.13 to finish 3rd. Liu
and Guo finished hard to place 7th and 8th with 15:37 times. CNJ
scored 17 points but MIT came through with 9.</P>

<P>The 1500, with Sean suffering from his bout with the flu was not
looking good. Seeded to only receive 2 points, MIT had little to
lose, but this was an event they were hoping would turn things
around. Brian Anderson and Dan Feldman did not disappoint with 2nd
and 4th place finishes respectively, both running 4:00. CNJ only
scored 3 points to bring the score to 51 for MIT and 36 for CNJ.</P>

<P>The High Hurdles final did not quite go as planned. Rajter,
favored to earn a 2nd place, and Mielcarz both made it to the finals
but did not get out well in the final. Rajter ran a fine time of 7.91
but only finished 4th. Craig, hoping to finish a little higher,
finished 8th. The CNJ hurdler finished 2nd with an excellent time of
7.84. This is where Rick new his foot was injured. With Sean not
placing in the 1500 and Rick out of the meet, the team started
getting down.</P>

<P>The 400 and 500 meter runs went well for MIT with Hoying and Yuval
Mazor placing 4th and 5th respectively in the 400, and Mark
Jeunnette, Matt Lehman and Tony Pelosi placing 2nd, 4th, and 7th in
the 500. However, CNJ won both events, not letting MIT gain much
ground.</P>

<P>The 800 meter run again saw Montgomery unable to deliver, however
George Hanson came through with a PR of 2:00.34 to gain a 6th place.
Feldman ran his second race of the day, finishing 8th with a 2:02.90.
CNJ placed 2nd and caught up 4 points. At this point, the team held a
brief team meeting to rally the troops and not let the opportunity
slip away. The rally cry seemed to put the spirit back in the
Engineers as they suddenly started cheering for each other. The
results were immediate. </P>

<P>Brian Anderson came back from his great 1500 and totally dominated
the 1000, running a PR of 2:31.46. Giving support was co-captain John
Biesiadecki, placing 3rd and Matt Yarosz placing 7th. Tech's 18
points to CNJ's 3 was a welcome turnaround. At the same time, the
long jumpers went from 5th, 7th, 8th coming out of the trials to take
3rd, 4th, 5th for a big rally. While the long jumpers were getting
the job done, so too were the pole vaulters. CNJ was seeded 1-2 in
the vault, but Sam Thibault would have none of that. Sam cleared a
season best 14-0 to place 2nd and break up the CNJ vaulters. MIT also
placed 4th and 5th to come out of that event with a 1 point
advantage.</P>

<P>The sprinters got the job done in both the 55 and 200 meter
events. Freshman Andrew Francis was not able to live up to his top
seed, but did come through with a 4th place. Marc Washington added a
5th place in the 55 and placed 5th in the 200 with a PR of 23.33.
</P>

<P>With four events to go (3000, DMR, 1600R, and Triple Jump) the
Engineers held a 23 point edge. This appeared to be a comfortable
amount to some, but Coach Halston Taylor of MIT was not so confident.
Whether or not Dan Feldman could come through in the 3000, his third
event was yet to be determined. Without Rajter and Montgomery, the
1600 Relay seemed to be beyond hope given their 6th seed. The DMR
seemed solid, but the TJ without Rajter put a lot of hope on Kalpak
Kothari.</P>

<P>Of course, as always, Feldman did come through. In fact he ran a
PR of 8:38.37, good enough for 2nd. Sean Nolan assisted the Engineers
effort with a 8:49.79 for 6th. This effort allowed MIT to prevent CNJ
from gaining any ground.</P>

<P>The 1600 Relay was not expected to do anything but run hard.
Apparently the quartet of Hoying, Muyiwa Oni, Lehman and Mazor
expected more. Hoying led things off with a solid 51.4 opening 400,
handing the baton off tied for the lead. Oni was unable to hold the
lead, but kept MIT within 5 meters with a 52.3 leg. Lehman ran an
outstanding leg, taking the lead down the homestretch. The handoff to
Mazor was perfect and Yuval wasted no time in getting out. After a
blistering 23.7 first 200, Yuval continued to push the baton around,
finishing with a 50.9 and maintaining the lead for a cumulative
3:26.23 performance.</P>

<P>In the DMR, all the 4th seeded MIT had to do was place 7th to
clinch the team victory. Jeunnette ran his first 1200 ever to lead
things off and bring the baton in front. Co-captain, Todd Rosenfield,
ran a solid 400 to keep MIT in front as he handed off to Hanson.
George started off well but faded at the end to allow the teams to
close a bit. Ed Keehr was not supposed to be able to compete with the
milers, particularly after he had run his best ever 5000 earlier.
Again, the engineers did not read the news. Ed took off, falling back
to 3rd at one point, but unleashed a vicious kick to walk down CNJ
and bring the baton in in 2nd place with a 4:30 anchor.</P>

<P>Kalpak finished things up in the triple jump with a 4th place 43-0
jump, 1 1/2 hours after the rest of the meet was over. Kalpak had two
narrow fouls that would have taken the victory, but it did not
matter, the meet was over much earlier.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT will send some of the top competitors to BU to face
stiffer competition than they will have at their own invitational at
MIT.</P>
