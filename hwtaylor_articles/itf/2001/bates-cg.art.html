SCORING MEET OF SEASON</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>JANUARY 20, 2001</P>

<P>Despite a late bus, many injuries and illnesses, and the attempt
to hold a couple of athletes to one event so that they could race
well at the GBTC Invitational on Sunday, MIT ran away with a
convincing victory over Bates College and the United States Coast
Guard Academy at Lewiston, Maine. The score of 295.5 for MIT to 144
for Bates and 142 for USCGA was one that showed MIT's depth as the
engineers only won 6 of the 17 events. However, in every event MIT
was able to have at least of their athletes score.</P>

<P>In a meet format that allows for 8 scoring places in all non-relay
events, with a scoring order of 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, MIT scored at least
10 points in every event. No team is allowed to have more than 4
scorers per event, which means that the maximum point score for an
event for a given team is 27 points. MIT scored 25 points in the Mile
for their closest effort at a sweep.</P>

<P>The Tech team did a good job of competing hard despite being
assured of a victory soon into the meet. MIT had 37 season bests, and
2 new qualifiers for the New England Division III Championships.
Andrew Francis '04, ran a 6.65 in the trials of the 55 Dash to not
only qualify but also move into MIT's top 10 all-time list. Rick
Rajter '03, also qualified with a .3 second PR of 7.87 in the 55HH.
Other impressive personal bests were made Brian Wong 'G, in the
Weight Throw (51-4 1/4), and Mark Jeunnette '02, in the 600 (1:26.0).
Mark ran his first race in over a year, and ran out of the slow
section to place 2nd with his superb performance.</P>

<P>MIT has their biggest meet thus far in the season next Saturday at
home. They face rival Williams College along with RPI, Colby College,
and Westfield State College. The meet carries particular importance
to MIT since Williams is the only team with a winning record against
them in the 90's. With MIT dominating the rivalry in the 80's it will
be interesting to see who will start the new millenium off on
top.</P>
