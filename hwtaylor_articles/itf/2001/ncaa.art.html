NATIONALS</B></FONT>

<P>MIT Men's Track and Field team sent six athletes to the NCAA
Division III Championships hosted by the University of Wisconsin
Oshkosh, and returned with five of them earning All-America status.
Scoring in two events, the Engineers placed 3rd in the Distance
Medley Relay (DMR), and 5th in the High Jump.</P>

<P>On the first night of competition, MIT's first competitor was Dan
Feldman in the 5000 meter race. Dan was seeded 6th and went out with
the leaders expecting to be among the top finishers. The fast early
pace was too much for many of the runners as they dropped back one by
one. The first mile was timed in 4:41 and the pace began to pick up
after the 2400 meter mark. Dan came through 2400 meters in 7:01 but
was showing the effects of the pace. Dan fell off the pace but stayed
in position to place until the final 800 meters. Dan finished with a
32 last 200 but it was too little, too late to finish higher than
8th.</P>

<P>Thirty minutes later, the DMR toed the line. Freshman Brian
Anderson led off the relay with the 1200 leg. Brian took the lead at
the start and never looked back, running splits of 58, 2:00 and 3:03
as he handed off in a tie for first. Brian Hoying was next with the
400 leg. Brian ran a great leg, taking the lead in the final straight
as he ran a 50.3 split. Mark Jeunnette took the baton and cautiously
led for three of the four laps before opening up with a 28 last 200
to finish the 800 in 1:55. Mark gave Sean Montgomery a 5 meter lead
to start the final leg. Sean was uncomfortable having the other
competitors hunting him down, so he slowed the pace to turn it into
more of an open 1600. No one else was willing to take the lead
despite the 800 split of 2:13. Finally, someone else pushed the pace
with a 64 second third 400 and took the lead going into the final
400. Sean ran the final 2 laps in 58, taking the lead with 100 meters
to go, but was unable to hold off two of the opposing runners in a
very close finish. MIT finished in 10:05.09 thanks to Sean's 4:15,
.21 seconds out of first.</P>

<P>Tech's next entry was not until Saturday. Both Brian Hoying and
Craig Mielcarz were entered in the High Jump. The opening height was
a low 6-4, which was cleared by both Craig and Brian, however Craig
made it on his 2nd attempt. At 6-6, both jumped well and looked to be
getting comfortable with the competition. Craig and Brian made 6-8,
but Craig made it on his second attempt and Brian on his third. There
were still 9 of the 14 competitors in at 6-9 3/4. Craig made it on
his 2nd attempt to join four others moving onto 6-11 1/2. Brian had a
very good attempt at 6-9 3/4 on his final attempt, just touching the
bar on the way down. Craig's 2nd attempt at 6-11 1/2 was very good
but not quite enough. Only one jumper cleared that height, but Craig
placed 5th due to his misses at previous heights.</P>

<P>MIT's 8 points tied them for 13th place. The best news is that all
MIT competitors will be back next indoor season to try and improve on
these results.</P>
