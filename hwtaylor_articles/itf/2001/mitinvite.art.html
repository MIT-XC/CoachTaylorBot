Division III Championships</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>February 10, 2001</P>

<P>In this day of needing to chase times and distances in order to
not only qualify for championships, but to also make the seeded
sections of those championships, MIT reluctantly joined the fray,
splitting their team between Boston University's Valentines
Invitational and their own invitational. </P>

<P>When track meets used to feature head to head races in the finals
of the best runners to make it through the qualifying rounds, the
need to go to the fastest tracks was not as crucial. Now that many
coaches want each championship to be a chance for advancement to the
next level of championship, many events have gone from rounds of
competition to final sections on time so the athletes do not have to
run as many races. If a coach wants an athlete to have a chance of
winning the race, that athlete needs to have a good enough
performance during the season to get into the fastest section.</P>

<P>With this in mind, MIT split their men's team between the two
venues. At BU, the primary beneficiaries of the banked track wer the
members of the 1600 Relay team. Yuval Mazor led off with a fantastic
50.3 opening leg. Brian Hoying, fresh off a high jump performance of
6-8 to qualify provisionally for the NCAA Championships, ran the best
leg of his career with a 49.6 400. Matt Lehman who had earlier run
1:08.09 in the 500, turned in a 49.9 3rd leg to bring Tech within
range of the NCAA banked track qualifying mark of 3:16.87. However,
Sean Montgomery was still feeling the effects of the flu and was
unable to run faster than 51.5. Nevertheless, the quartet was able to
run a season best of 3:21.75.</P>

<P>Back at MIT, the Engineers were being led by upper classmen who
were determined to end their indoor careers in the championships, not
with the invitational. John Biesiadecki ran a superb 1:59.12 in the
800 to give MIT a good chance of putting together a strong 4x800 team
later in the season. In the Pole Vault, Sam Thibault cleared 14-6 for
a personal best to win the event. Kalpak Kothari showed he is
rounding into championship form with a 44-0 triple jump.</P>

<P>Other personal bests were acheived by; Andrew Francis '04, in the
200 with a 23.61 performance, Craig Wildman '03, in the 1500 with a
4:15.07 run, Adrian Townsend '04, and Tony Pelosi '01, in the 55HH
and the Long Jump with respective performances of 8.44 and 8.57, and
19-9 3/4 and 19-5 1/2. All three freshmen Weight Throwers had PRs
with Marios Michalakis throwing 45-11 1/2, David Saylor throwing 38-7
3/4, and Scott Bradley heaving the ball 35-9 3/4.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT travels to Tufts to defend the New England Division
III Indoor Championship against favored Williams College.</P>
