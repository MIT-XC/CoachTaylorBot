            <p align="left">January 24-25, 2020</p>
            <p align="left">The first of two marathon meets at Boston University,&nbsp;the <a href="terrier.res.php">John Thomas Terrier Invitational</a> was held this weekend.&nbsp; With over 3,000 entries, and impressive fields led by the likes of Lolo Jones (60HH) and Paul Tanui (5K) the 10 hour days of competition promised many thrilling moments.&nbsp; Day one was for the&nbsp;women, with the exception of the Men's Elite 5K (13:15 winning&nbsp;time) and DMR. The men were competing on day two.</p>
            <p align="left">MIT brought a handful of runners to take advantage of arguably the fastest indoor track in the world.&nbsp; The NCAA corrects for any track over 200 meters in size, or any banked&nbsp;track.&nbsp; The penalty is uniform regardless of the oversize or the degree of the bank.&nbsp; Most banked tracks are not worth the penalty, but the BU track is worth it, hence the willingness for so many to enter at $30 per entry.</p>
            <p align="left">Margaret Trautner '20 got things started&nbsp;for the Engineers, racing the 800.&nbsp; Despite having the&nbsp;flu&nbsp;early in the week, the senior seemed no worse for it.&nbsp; Seeded the slowest in her section, she came through the 200 in last, splitting 32.5.&nbsp; She slowly moved up in the field, earning second in her section with&nbsp;a fine early season time of&nbsp;2:13.75.&nbsp; Also in&nbsp;the 800 for Tech were Skyler Brooks&nbsp;'20&nbsp;and Nina Rhone '23.&nbsp; Brooks raced well&nbsp;with the&nbsp;exception of&nbsp;slowing&nbsp;down too much in the&nbsp;middle laps.&nbsp; She finished tough in a&nbsp;personal best of 2:18.35. Rhone did not respond to opportunities that were&nbsp;presented to her during the race, but still&nbsp;ran 2:20.76&nbsp;for a season best.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 400, Sarah Ishamuddin '21 took advantage of the banked track to&nbsp;lower her&nbsp;season best&nbsp;to 60.42. She hit&nbsp;the&nbsp;first split in 27.7, but fell&nbsp;off&nbsp;after a few changes in momentum.</p>
            <p align="left">Katie Williams '21 was&nbsp;in a fast section of the 1,000 and&nbsp;took&nbsp;advantage of that opportunity even though she did not mix it up with the field.&nbsp; She started out in the back and basically did her own thing, ignoring the competition, but using them as a gauge, splitting 33.9, 69.6 and&nbsp;1:45.8.&nbsp; She finished pretty strong to run 2:57.06.&nbsp; Katie Bacher '20 was&nbsp;in the 1,000 for her season debut, coming back from a cross country injury.&nbsp; In the first lap the&nbsp;senior fell hard when she tried to avoid the outside alley breaking&nbsp;in.&nbsp; She jumped  up quickly, but over-reacted, putting too much energy into getting back into the&nbsp;race.&nbsp; With her conditioning still lacking, she faded&nbsp;at&nbsp;the end, running 3:08.47.</p>
            <p align="left">The Mile Run was up and Marissa McPhillips '20 was hoping&nbsp;for a strong performance after her 5:07 flat&nbsp;track effort last week.&nbsp; The pace was initially slow, splitting 77 for the first quarter.&nbsp; The slow pace caused a lot of contact, nearly taking McPhillips out at one point.&nbsp; The pace picked up, spreading out the&nbsp;field as McPhillips split 2:31.&nbsp; As the pack was approaching the three quarter mark, she suddenly fell off, as she got in her own head and lost&nbsp;focus of&nbsp;the&nbsp;race, although&nbsp;she split 3:47.1.&nbsp; She&nbsp;completely went out&nbsp;the back after that, finishing in 5:17.72.</p>
            <p align="left">Einat Gavish '22 was up in&nbsp;the 3K.&nbsp; The pace was fine and the sophomore was running a smart&nbsp;race, splitting the&nbsp;1600 in 5:27.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the opportunity was there to go with the leaders, Gavish thought instead of acted, and did not go with them.&nbsp; Running in limbo, she slowed and the field she had run away from,&nbsp;came&nbsp;back and passed her.&nbsp; Instead of 82's, she&nbsp;was running 86's.&nbsp; She fought back a little with each group that caught up to her, but still only ran 10:30.06.&nbsp; If she can focus and race in the second half like she did in the first half she will put together a great race.</p>
            <p align="left">Katie Collins '21 and Jenna Melanson '20 were in the 5K, the last event of the day for the women.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both were in the fast section, but expecting very different paces.&nbsp; Collins was looking for a pace  closer to 5:25 per 1600 while Melanson was hoping for&nbsp;a 5:35 pace.&nbsp; Collins was right on pace from the start,&nbsp;but&nbsp;Melanson was&nbsp;out a little too fast in 82&nbsp;and&nbsp;then 80 for the first&nbsp;two quarters.&nbsp; Collins came through the 1600 in 5:26 and Melanson&nbsp;in 5:30.&nbsp; Collins was picking off runners as she went, not having anyone to&nbsp;pace&nbsp;with.&nbsp; Melanson had a pacer in MIT volunteer assistant,&nbsp;Laura Paulsen, and used that&nbsp;to stay on pace&nbsp;through&nbsp;a 5:36 second 1600.&nbsp; Collins never deviated off pace, running 5:27 for the&nbsp;second&nbsp;1600 and 5:30 for&nbsp; the&nbsp;third 1600.&nbsp; Melanson&nbsp;fell&nbsp;off the pace with 1400 to go, finishing&nbsp;in 17:34.55.&nbsp; Collins&nbsp;ran a superb time&nbsp;of 17:05.09.</p>
            <p align="left">Albert&nbsp;Menio '20 was the only field event&nbsp;performer at&nbsp;the meet for MIT.&nbsp; Menio&nbsp;was in the 35 lb. Weight Throw and had his&nbsp;best throw on his first effort,&nbsp;placing ninth with&nbsp;a 54-7 1/4 performance.</p>
            <p align="left">The&nbsp;first runner for&nbsp;the men&nbsp;was&nbsp;Ellery Rajagopal '21 in the 800. The&nbsp;race&nbsp;set up&nbsp;nicely as the pace was&nbsp;solid at 27 for the&nbsp;first 200 with Rajagopal in the top third at 27.9.&nbsp;The&nbsp;pace&nbsp;slowed, but not badly, allowing&nbsp;Rajagopal to relax.&nbsp;During the third lap he moved up, positioning himself to take control of the race as they hit the 600 mark in 1:28.5.&nbsp; He&nbsp;took the lead before the turn and pulled away to win&nbsp;in a big personal&nbsp;best of 1:56.60.</p>
            <p align="left">Benton Wilson '21&nbsp;and Nisarg Dharia '23 were representing MIT in the 400.&nbsp; Wilson raced first, again getting a favored lane in lane 5.&nbsp; He got out well in 22.5, but was still in last.&nbsp;He made a move&nbsp;to pass, but it was too late, so he had to cut momentum and tuck back in.&nbsp; Losing momentum at that part of a 400 generally ends your race, and this was no exception.&nbsp;For some reason he was taking up too much time in lane two and three during the second 200. Although Wilson ran 49.66, he is capable of much faster.&nbsp; Dharia got out very well and earned the break out of lane 2, but then he did not&nbsp;pay attention to his outside, and let someone get the edge on him going into the turn.&nbsp; Again, this forced Dharia to cut momentum.&nbsp; Worse, he hugged the rail on the backstretch, and again did not pay attention to his outside, getting boxed in.&nbsp; This again forced him to cut momentum, ending any hope of a fast time.&nbsp; He finished in 51.33.</p>
            <p align="left">Nick Duchatellier '22 was racing the 500, where the coaching staff was trying to determine if the 400 or 600 was his best race.&nbsp;This meet did not have the 600, which tends to be more of a Division III event. He went out very fast although being in a fast section still had him next to last throughout the race.&nbsp; He split 23.0 and 49.2 en route to a 1:06.12 PR.&nbsp; Perhaps proving the 400 might be his best bet.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 1000, Matt Schofield '22 ran an excellent time of 2:31.47, but how he did it was far from excellent.&nbsp; Not accustomed to large, condensed fields, the&nbsp;sophomore made numerous poor decisions with regard to moving up and staying off the rail.&nbsp; The lack of lane awareness caused him to&nbsp;change momentum quite a few times.&nbsp;However, with&nbsp;250 to go, Schofield blasted into second, running a 29 on top of his 2:02&nbsp;to finish&nbsp;second in his section.</p>
            <p align="left">A few hours later, Sam Acquaviva '23 and Lowell Hensgen '23 did battle in the 3K.&nbsp; The pace of the leaders worked out well as they ran 69 pace through the first 1600 as Hensgen was in third and Acquaviva in fifth, splitting 4:36 and 4:37 respectively.&nbsp; Hensgen took the&nbsp;lead after 2K, but did nothing with it, encouraging others to move up.&nbsp;In the final lap Acquaviva stormed to the front, pulling away to win in 8:35.30.&nbsp; Hensgen pulled into second on the backstretch and held it to the finish in 8:36.78.&nbsp; This was a nice 1-2 for the freshmen.</p>
            <p align="left">In the final event of the weekend, the 5K, Andrew Mah '22 was unfortunately seeded as the top seed in section three, where it would  have been a much more competitive situation for him to have been in Section two.&nbsp; Zach Johnson '22 was also in Section three.&nbsp; Mah wanted 70's, but what&nbsp;he got was 71's.&nbsp; After a 72 at the 2K, Mah took the lead.&nbsp; Johnson was running 72's, which was probably a little too&nbsp;ambitious&nbsp;at this time of&nbsp; the season.&nbsp; Mah opened up a huge gap, coming through 3200 in 9:24 and looking strong.&nbsp; Johnson looked solid at 9:37.&nbsp; For both of them, the wheels sort of came off the bus after that.&nbsp; Mah was having trouble with his breathing, slowing to a 4:55&nbsp;third mile as the leaders caught him.&nbsp; Johnson slowed to a 5:10 after the fatigue hit him.&nbsp; Mah finished in 14:58.17 while&nbsp;Johnson ran 15:26.39.&nbsp; Both times were respectable, but they can run much faster&nbsp;under the right conditions,&nbsp;and certainly&nbsp;later in the season.</p>
            <p align="left">Next week, many of the distance runners will take the weekend off.&nbsp;Of those competing, a few will go to the NEICAAA Championship at the Reggie Lewis Center, while&nbsp;others will compete at&nbsp;Tufts University in the Branwyn Smith-King Invitational.</p>
