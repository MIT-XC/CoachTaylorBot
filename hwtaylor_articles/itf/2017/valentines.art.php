            <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 16px"><strong>MIT Splits Squad -- Tregoning, Albritten Set Varsity Records, Zak Establishes Freshman Record</strong></span></p>
            <p align="left">February 10-11, 2017</p>
            <p align="left">With one week remaining before the New England Division III Championship, MIT split their squad to take advantage of the best opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the oval runners would compete at&nbsp;the <a href="valentines.res.php">Boston University David Hemery&nbsp;Valentine Invitational</a> while sprinters, hurdlers and field event athletes were mostly at MIT for the <a href="gordonkelly.res.pdf">Gordon Kelly Invitational</a>.</p>
            <p align="left">In the first event for MIT at the BU meet, Tech's top two long jumpers, Nneoma Okonkwo '18 and Haley Strouf '18 did very well in their premier event.&nbsp; Okonkwo jumped 18-7 1/4 on her first attempt in the finals, while Strouf jumped 18-3 3/4 on her final attempt for a new PR that moves her to #4 on the New England Division III list and #11 on the National list.</p>
            <p align="left">Bailey Tregoning&nbsp;'19 was then up in the 800.&nbsp; On an inside stagger, the sophomore got out well, but did not quite guage the break as she ended up getting pushed to the back.&nbsp; She panicked a little, made an aggressive move to get out of a box, which was an unnecessary use of energy.&nbsp; From that point on she ran a&nbsp;flawless race, hitting the 400 in 63.1.&nbsp; She moved up to second as she came through the 600 in 1:36 and looked good through the 700 where her aggressive move came back to bite her.&nbsp; Although her final 100 was slower she still ran a 2:10.92, a new MIT record, and the second fastest time in all of Division&nbsp;III.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 400 the Engineers were represented by Hannah Chen '18.&nbsp;Only the fastest sections were allowed the&nbsp;use of starting blocks and Chen was not in one of those, so she chose to do a standing start, which is never recommended.&nbsp; She proceeded to false start, although it was not called.&nbsp; By the time she recovered the field was long gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading up to the break she ran great, but being behind cost her as she was stuck behind others breaking in ahead of her, forcing her to lose momentum.&nbsp; She finished with a 58.21, but could have easily run 57 flat or better.</p>
            <p align="left">Skylar Brooks '20 was scheduled to race in the next event, the 500.&nbsp; For some reason&nbsp;she ran it more like an 800 instead of a 400.&nbsp; The net result&nbsp;was a 65 400 and non competitive from there&nbsp;as she finished in 1:23.80.</p>
            <p align="left">Over an hour later, Chen was back in the 200, along with Okonkwo and Michelle Menkiti '20.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again without the use of blocks, all but Menkiti did a three point start.&nbsp; Okonkwo ran what appeared to be an easy 25.74.&nbsp; Chen cruised to a 25.92 and Menkiti ran a 26.27.&nbsp; All three were indoor bests.</p>
            <p align="left">MIT had five runners in the Mile.&nbsp; In the third fastest section Tech had Maryann Gong '17, Marissa McPhillips '20 and Katie Bacher '20.&nbsp; The pace was fast from the start with the leaders going out in 71 at the 400.&nbsp; Bacher was up towards the front at 72 while Gong and McPhillips were back at 73.&nbsp; The pace was not slowing&nbsp;down going into the half-way mark.&nbsp; Bacher split 2:25 and Gong and McPhillips 2:26.&nbsp;Just as they were coming into the 800 Gong moved towards the front.&nbsp; The third quarter had Gong at 3:37 for a 72 quarter, but Bacher and McPhillips were beginning to feel the effects of the quick pace, falling back to 3:41 and 3:42 respectively.&nbsp; The final 400 was one of survival.&nbsp; Gong held on well with a 73 to finish in 4:50.52, getting passed at the finish by alum, Louise van den Heuvel '14.&nbsp; McPhillips ran a 76 for a 4:58.84 PR and Bacher closed in 79 for a 5:00.95.&nbsp; A few sections later Jenna Melanson '20 ran a 5:15.08 as she faded badly with an 84 final 400 after a solid 2:33 first 800.&nbsp; Last up was Clemmie Mitchell '18.&nbsp; Mitchell had her best race ever with a 5:04.91 performance.&nbsp; Starting in the back with a conservative 77, she methodically moved up in the pack with another&nbsp;77.&nbsp;&nbsp;With over 600 meters remaining Mitchell took the lead and began pulling away as she ran&nbsp;a 76 and then opened up in the final quarter with a 74 to win going away.</p>
            <p align="left">The men were competing on day two and MIT opened up with the 800.&nbsp; Nathan Munet '19 was the sole runner for MIT&nbsp;as he was hoping to improve his time&nbsp;of 1:54.60.&nbsp;He was placed in lane six, which meant he did not know how fast others were going out.&nbsp; When he got around to the break it was clear he was behind.&nbsp; He had to slow down further as he could not easily slide in to the pack.&nbsp; Working his way from the back Munet spent a lot of time in lane two as he split 56.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;His third 200 was slower, but still solid at 1:25.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;He tightened up in the final 200 as the leaders pulled away.&nbsp; He finished reasonably well in 1:55.64.</p>
            <p align="left">Tom Frejowski '19 ran an indoor PR in the 400, coming through the 200 in 24.0 en route to a 50.33.&nbsp; Danny Newman '17 ran 50.79.</p>
            <p align="left">Tyndale Hannan '20 ran the 500 for the first time.&nbsp; He did an awkward standing start as he did not feel comfortable with his three point start, putting himself at a disadvantage.&nbsp; He ran the first 200 in the back of the pack, but competed well from that point on, coming through the 400 in 51.5.&nbsp; He passed two people in the final 100 to run 1:04.81, the third fastest in MIT history.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 200, Tre Albritten '18 took advantage of lane six and blasted a 21.48, the fastest time in all of Division III, breaking his own MIT record of 21.78.&nbsp; Newman and Frejowski came back from the 400, running 22.74 and 23.09 respectively, both season bests.</p>
            <p align="left">In the field events, only Alec Reduker '20 and Billy Ruschel '18 competed at BU.&nbsp;Reduker cleared 6-6 3/4 and Ruschel fouled out as both were getting accustomed to the softer surfaces at BU.</p>
            <p align="left">Simon Alford '20 competed well in the 1000, although running the first 200 too fast&nbsp;(29.3).&nbsp;&nbsp;He paid the price for that 200, but held on nicely, running splits of 59.2 and 2:00.4 as he went backwards in the field.&nbsp; His final time of 2:32.87 is the second fastest on the team this year.</p>
            <p align="left">In the Mile Run, Aidan Gilson '19 ran a controlled but solid race.&nbsp; He started out towards the back of the pack, but still came through the first quarter in 61.7.&nbsp; The pack slowed as he moved up, splitting 2:06 and 3:12.&nbsp; Gilson kicked well, but not with the same zeal he had last year, almost as if he has not used it in so long&nbsp;that he forgot what it&nbsp;was like.&nbsp; Nevertheless his 4:15.22 was by far his best race of the season.&nbsp; Next up was distance runner, Josh Derrick '20.&nbsp; Derrick, in his first Mile of the year, ran with a&nbsp;lot of heart and desire, but made a couple dozen unnecessary moves throughout the race, wasting a lot of energy.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he fought through splits of 63, 2:07 and 3:14 before taking the lead.&nbsp; However, his previous wasted moves bit him&nbsp;as he lost the lead in the final 100.&nbsp; His 4:17.96 was still a personal best and provided hopes of better things to come.</p>
            <p align="left">The 4x400 Relay was the final event for the Engineers.&nbsp; They were hoping to get a time fast enough to move them into the fast section of next week's New England Division III Championship.&nbsp; Frejowski led off, but just did not have it from the start.&nbsp; His 52.5 split but the team far from their intended mark.&nbsp; Albritten moved up to the 400, performing well as he went out hard in 22.9 to close the gap substantially, finishing in 49.3.&nbsp; Hannan ran an excellent leg, splitting 49.1 to get MIT out of last place.&nbsp; Newman ran anchor, but was unable to make up ground in the second 200, closing in 50.7 for a season best 3:21.71.</p>
            <p align="left">Back at MIT some impressive performances were happening as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the women, the best performance was supplied by Gabriella Zak '20 in the 600.&nbsp; The hurdler/pentathlete took the 600 out in a unrealistic 29.0, but held on to run 1:39.34 without competition for a new MIT freshman record.</p>
            <p align="left">Quite a few personal bests were established by the women.&nbsp; Ariela Slutsky '18 threw a PR 40-1 in the Shot Put.&nbsp; Folusho Jebutu '20 had personal bests in both throwing events; 41-10 1/4 in the Weight Throw and 34-5 1/4 in the Shot Put.</p>
            <p align="left">In the Pole Vault, Kaitlyn Sparks '20 and Kari Stromhaug&nbsp;'19 both cleared season bests 11-8 1/2 and Madeleine Waller '17 had a season best of 10-2 3/4.</p>
            <p align="left">On the men's side, Chris Washington '20 had a huge personal best of 6-7 3/4 in his first competition after suffering through a bout of Mono.&nbsp; Also in the High Jump, Sope Eweje '19 cleared a PR 5-10.&nbsp; Luke Gray '18 did his first heptathlon of the year to qualify for next weekend's championship, scoring 4036 points.&nbsp; Along the way, the junior cleared a PR 13-3 1/2 in the Pole Vault.&nbsp; Jason Villanueva '19 jumped a season best 43-8 1/2 in the Triple Jump.&nbsp; Scott Cameron '19 vaulted a season best 15-0.</p>
            <p align="left">In the DMR&nbsp;the distance runners showed some speed.&nbsp; Matt Deyo 'G led off with a 3:08.5.&nbsp;Ken Acquah '20 ran a 54.4 400 leg.&nbsp; Brian Bates '20 started out with a 28.3 first 200 and finished with a 2:02.6 leg.&nbsp; Dennis Maloney '19 was a bit too excited, leading off with a 58.9, but settled in to run an impressive 4:15.1 to bring the team home in 10:20.75.</p>
            <p align="left">Next week, both the men&nbsp;and women attempt to defend their New England Division III titles.&nbsp; The men, competing at Tufts, are going for their fifth consecutive title while the women will be trying for their third in a row at home.</p>
