            <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 16px"><strong>Gong Leads MIT at NCAA Division III Championship</strong></span></p>
            <p align="left">March 10-11, 2017</p>
            <p align="left">MIT's Men's and Women's Track &amp; Field teams entered the <a href="2017NCAA.res.pdf">NCAA Division III Indoor Track &amp; Field Championship</a>, hosted by North Central College in Naperville, Illinois with high hopes but very aware it would be a stretch to accomplish their season long rank of #2 for women and #4 for men.&nbsp; Two very high seeds were missing from the men's team; Arinze Okeke '17, the number three seed in the Triple Jump, and Tre Albritten '18, the fourth seed in the 200.&nbsp; In addition, both Matt Deyo 'G and Dennis Maloney '19 were racing both the 3K and 5K, meaning achieving their seeds in both would take some serious positive thinking and fortitude.</p>
            <p align="left">For the women, who were seeded to score a lot of points, their fate was largely resting on the very capable shoulders of Maryann Gong '17, who would be tripling in the Mile, 3K and anchoring the DMR.&nbsp; Capable or not, this was a large load, particularly with the Mile having trials and finals.</p>
            <p align="left">The weekend began with the Women's Long Jump.&nbsp; Nneoma Okonkwo '18 was the second seed and as such, certainly entertained the thought of winning.&nbsp; Her first jump was enough to get her into finals, but was very cautious as she approached the board.&nbsp; The second jump was an improvement, but still a deceleration into the board compromised her result.&nbsp; In the finals, she moved up to third place on her fifth attempt, a jump of 18-9 3/4, but even with that it was clear she was being cautious.&nbsp; By the time her final attempt came around she had been passed and was sitting in fifth place.&nbsp; Her final jump was a big one and possibly enough to win.&nbsp;After about a minute, and with the use of the video system now at all takeoff boards, it was ruled a foul by the narrowest of margins.&nbsp; Her mark was very close to the 20' mark.&nbsp; So fifth it was.</p>
            <p align="left">Next up was the Pole Vault for women.&nbsp; MIT was represented by Kaitlyn Sparks '20, seeded 16th and Kari Stromhaug '19, seeded ninth.&nbsp; With the exception of the top vaulter, the competitors were very close in marks, so total misses would likely be a large determining factor in place.&nbsp; At the opening height of 11-3 3/4 Sparks cleared on her first attempt, but Stromhaug needed two attempts to clear.&nbsp; There were 16 vaulters competing and all who jumped at that height made it.&nbsp; At 11-9 3/4, both Sparks and Stromhaug made it on their first attempt.&nbsp; Three vaulters went out at that height, bringing the field to 13.&nbsp; The next height was 12-3 1/2.&nbsp; Both Sparks and Stromhaug cleared on the second attempt, which was a new PR and freshman record for Sparks.&nbsp; Six competitors went out at this height, meaning there were seven remaining and both MIT vaulters would be All American.&nbsp; Neither was able to clear 12-7 1/2, although both had very solid attempts.&nbsp; Katherine Pitman '18 of Ithaca College won in a new NCAA record of 13-8 1/2.&nbsp; Of the eight All Americans only one is a senior.</p>
            <p align="left">Gong was up for her first of two races on the first day, the trials of the Mile Run.&nbsp; Seeded second, the senior wanted to do just  enough to get into the finals.&nbsp; However, her nervousness got the best of her, so instead of hanging out in the back of the field, she ended up running the entire race in lane two and three, running approximately 50 meters more than those on the rail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her 5:01.92, which would have really been about a 4:53 had she been in the inside lane, was enough to get her in the final.</p>
            <p align="left">Bailey Tregoning '19, the third seed in the 800, had been nursing what was likely a stress reaction in her foot for nearly two weeks, which was certainly a distraction at best and a limiting factor at worst.&nbsp; In the first of two heats, the sophomore, instead of sitting at the back of the pack, settled into second place behind a very fast paced lead.&nbsp; Tregoing split 31, 64 and 1:38 as she was about 10 meters behind first and 10 meters ahead of third.&nbsp; However, in the final 100 the wheels came off the bus and she slowed to finish in 2:14.81, missing finals by two places as she finished 10th overall and only eight were moving on to the finals.</p>
            <p align="left">Now it was the men's turn to score some points.&nbsp; Deyo and Maloney entered the 5K as 10th and second seeds respectively.&nbsp; Both have plenty of speed and enough endurance to handle any strategy that would develop.&nbsp; They only needed to be patient and let the race play out.&nbsp; Patience is not one of Deyo's strong suits and Maloney is just not experienced enough.&nbsp; Deyo took the lead at the gun, running a 32 first 200 before realizing the error of his ways and then brought the pace down to a reasonable level, but he was still in the lead through the first mile of 4:36.&nbsp; Maloney was much more relaxed, but not enough, as he&nbsp;reacted to every move while sitting amongst the top five runners.&nbsp; The second mile definitely slowed as Deyo gave up the lead but then took it over again briefly.&nbsp; The two mile split was 9:21 for the field, a pedestrian enough pace for everyone to know that the kick would start early.&nbsp;&nbsp;As he is known to do, Deyo slowed at this point, but with 900 meters to go was still less than two seconds out of first and Maloney was just over two additional seconds back.&nbsp;This is where the leaders took over, dropping the pace to a 65 quarter.&nbsp; Deyo ran a 68 as he woke up and Maloney a 70&nbsp;as his legs would not respond.&nbsp; Deyo added a 67, but still lost ground to the leaders and Maloney dropped to a 74.&nbsp; Deyo ran a 32 final 200 to grab eighth, .11 out of sixth in a time of 14:31.43.&nbsp; Maloney finished 11th in 14:43.74.</p>
            <p align="left">The final event of the evening for MIT was the Women's DMR.&nbsp;After the 800 Trials, Tregoning's foot was hurting her a lot.&nbsp; This combined with her poor finish made her seriously doubt her ability to help the team.&nbsp; Fortunately, the team had brought along Katie Bacher '20 as an alternate just in&nbsp;case something were to go wrong with any of the other legs as the freshman was capable of doing very well at any of the legs.&nbsp; After much deliberation a last minute decision was made to substitute Bacher for Tregoning.&nbsp; The questions were many.&nbsp; Could two freshman (Marissa McPhillips, Bacher) deliver on the big stage?&nbsp; How much did the hard mile take out of Gong?&nbsp; Would the last minute decision to race cause Bacher to &quot;freak out&quot;?&nbsp; McPhillips ran the leadoff 1200 leg.&nbsp; Despite a pretty quick 34 second first lap, McPhillips was in next to last place in the 12 team field.&nbsp; After splits of 70 and 2:25, McPhillips was moving up despite looking a bit tired.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her next 200 moved her up to fifth, but in the final 200 she could only deliver a 40, pushing her back to seventh at the handoff with a 3:43.7 split, putting her team in a strong position.&nbsp;Hannah Chen '18, after a very physical exchange, settled in to move her team up.&nbsp; Her first lap of 27.4 was very good and set up a strong second lap where she was able to move up to 6th, right with the fifth place team in 57.6.&nbsp;Bacher took over and looked as though she had been doing this all her life.&nbsp; Even though she was obviously holding back, she still split 31 and 64 for the first two laps.&nbsp; Her 600 split was 1:39 as she moved into fourth and her final split, an amazing 2:14.8, moved her into third and right on the heels of second.&nbsp; When Gong received the baton she was able to move right into second, but the leader was approximately 10 seconds in front and a very capable runner.&nbsp; Gong's plan was to run 73's and see what happens.&nbsp; The thought was that this was enough to keep the chase group at bay, who&nbsp;were about 10 meters behind, and possibly catch the leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her initial 400 of 72 did not make a dent, but basically kept things the same. In the second 400 Gong made some progress as it was clear her 2:27.0 had closed some ground on the leader while opening up a little daylight on her opposition trying to catch her.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1200 split was 3:41 as Gong started to look tired and even less than the super human she has been.&nbsp; The chase pack could sense this and tried harder to close.&nbsp; About this time Gong saw&nbsp;she was only about 40 meters down from the leader and really started to push.&nbsp; Her final 400 of 72 left her two seconds shy of first, but keep everyone else away as her team clocked an 11:50.15&nbsp;for second place.</p>
            <p align="left">Gong was up first on the second day, starting the Mile final.&nbsp; She was positioned on the inside and got pushed to&nbsp;the back at the gun.&nbsp; This gave her the chance to run from the back, which was a good thing given the pace.&nbsp; Even in last position the first quarter was 70.&nbsp; From there the pace slowed and bunched up.&nbsp; Although cognizant to stay in lane one as much as possible, she still moved in and out, looking for an opportunity to move up to the front.&nbsp; That opportunity did not make itself available until there was 400 meters to go.&nbsp; She should have probably moved hard at that point, but everyone was sprinting since the pace had slowed to 3:44 at the three quarter mark.&nbsp; Even though she ran a 71 final quarter, she was only able to move up to sixth with a final time of 4:55.70.&nbsp; This marked the third indoor Mile All America award for Gong.</p>
            <p align="left">Billy Ruschel '18 was up next in the Triple Jump.&nbsp; Seeded 10th, but only about 90% healthy after coming back from a hamstring strain three weeks ago, Ruschel was nevertheless there to compete.&nbsp; Fouling his first attempt and then cutting his second jump short he was down to his final attempt.&nbsp; He had a marvelous attempt landing in the pit well past 47'.&nbsp; The jump was marked at 14.54, but was recorded at 13.54.&nbsp; The only official video, which was the system used at the foul board, is not capable of seeing the measuring tape, so even though all jumps coaches in the box said it was 14.54 and the video and pictures MIT had showed a jump of well over 47', it all had to be disregarded&nbsp;since it was not &quot;official video source&quot;.&nbsp;A failed protest followed by an appeal netted Ruschel one more attempt.&nbsp; While his mark that was mis-recorded would have put him in fifth place, his re-jump, at 46-5 1/4 put him in ninth, good enough for finals.&nbsp; In the finals he was not able to improve his mark, but competed well, particularly coming back from being out of the finals to getting one more attempt and then delivering.</p>
            <p align="left">The final event for MIT was the Men's and Women's 3K.&nbsp; The women were first and that meant the final indoor collegiate race for Maryann Gong.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 14 time All American was hoping for one more.&nbsp; Certainly feeling her three previous races, she was determined to relax and let the race come to her. The early pace was pretty slow and Gong was content to hang out in the back, coming through the mile in 5:18.&nbsp; The problem was that the two front runners started breaking away after 1200 meters and Gong was unaware.&nbsp; By the time she realized what was going on they had a four second lead that expanded to six seconds.&nbsp; Gong started whittling away at that lead with 400 to go, closing it down to two and a half seconds from the win, finishing in 9:44.93 for third place.&nbsp; Her final 800 was a 2:29 and final 200 a 34.</p>
            <p align="left">Deyo and Maloney were back for a second helping of distance racing with the 3K.&nbsp; With so many doubling back from the 5K its was thought that Peter Hale of Williams, the fastest seed and fresh, would take the lead and control the race.&nbsp; They needed to be ready for any sort of pace, but to be aware it could pick up at anytime.&nbsp; After a pedestrian 4:34 1600 and one more quarter at that pace, it gradually picked up.&nbsp; Hale dropped the pace to a 64 and then a 61 before finishing it off with a 28 200 to blow away the field.&nbsp; Deyo was there until 600 to go, but then fell off hard&nbsp;with a 69 400&nbsp;finishing in 13th with an 8:32.12.&nbsp; Maloney finished in 15th in 8:36.38.</p>
            <p align="left">The women tied for fifth with 26 points while the men finished in 69th with only one point.&nbsp; The meet had its ups and downs, with a bit of bad luck and even an official's error that cost Ruschel an All American honor.&nbsp; All MIT athletes competed with integrity and to the best of their ability.&nbsp; Now they will move their focus to the outdoor season&nbsp;as the championships begins in seven weeks.</p>
            <p align="left">A number of Alums dropped by  and their support was greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Alex Menchaca '85, Sean Schubert '88, Kyle Hannon '13, Veronica Szklarzewski '15 and Carrington Motley '16 all added a supportive voice for the MIT athletes.</p>
