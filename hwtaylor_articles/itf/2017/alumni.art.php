            <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 16px">Okonkwo, Gong and Reduker Set Records</span></p>
            <p align="left">January 7, 2017</p>
            <p align="left">The snowstorm, which began about the same time as the start of the annual <a href="alumni.res.pdf">Varsity vs. Alumni Indoor Track &amp; Field meet</a>, did not prevent 55 alums from showing up to compete and/or support their &quot;Has-Been&quot; teammates.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the varsity team prevailed, the men earning a 97 to 28 victory and the women taking the win with 88 points to 38 for the alumnae.</p>
            <p align="left">While the men graduated a quartet of outstanding long sprinters&nbsp;and two impressive horizontal jumpers that could have given the alums the weapons necessary to be a threat, the current varsity team was very pleased that only two of those six returned to compete.&nbsp; To make up for those losses, the varsity had beefed up their high jump squad and that was evident in the first event.&nbsp; Alec Reduker '20&nbsp;entered the competition at 6-2, cleared it on his first attempt, then did the same with 6-4 to win the competition.&nbsp; He then put the bar at 6-10 1/4, clearing it on his second attempt to set a new MIT freshman record.&nbsp; Freshman teammates Chris Washington and Steven Speck took second and third, both clearing 6-2.</p>
            <p align="left">The tone was set, but the alumni had their moments.&nbsp; Ben Schreck '15 took first&nbsp;place honors in the Pole Vault, clearing 15-4 1/4 to defeat Raja Rajcic '20, who cleared 13-5 1/4.&nbsp; Marshall Wentworth '16 edged &quot;Has-Been&quot; teammate, Jordan Mizerak '14 for third place at 12-11 1/2.&nbsp; Other alums in the vault were Justin Schmidt '10 and Nate Sharpe '09.</p>
            <p align="left">Sam Parker '15 matched Schreck's performance by taking the 800 meter victory.&nbsp; Letting Nathan Munet '19 set the pace, Parker took the lead in the final lap to sprint to a 1:57.25 win.&nbsp; Munet was close at 1:57.62 and Tyndale Hannan '20 took third in 1:57.74.&nbsp; Other alums in the event were Rick Paez '15 and Logan Trimble '13.</p>
            <p align="left">The only other alumni victory was earned by Kyle Hannon '13.&nbsp; Hannon, the Mile Run record holder at 4:06.42, brought his talents down to the sprints.&nbsp;He fell slightly short in the 60, missing third place by .08 seconds at 7.68 to teammate Michael Kaba '16, but took the victory in the 200 at 24.58.  Also racing, but tweaking his hamstring was David Blau '06.</p>
            <p align="left">An impressive effort in an alumni double was turned in by Justin Bullock '14.&nbsp; Bullock, in pretty good condition despite the rigors of medical school, took out the Mile in 30 seconds for the first 200, hoping to drop the varsity runners.&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming through the 400 in 61, with the varsity runners sitting back at 63, the wheels started coming off the bus as the pace slowed and the varsity runners took control.&nbsp; Dennis Maloney '19 ultimately prevailed at 4:20.72 with Matt Deyo 'G placing second at 4:24.00.&nbsp; David Walter '18 secured third in 4:26.92.&nbsp; Bullock finished at 4:44.36.&nbsp; In the 5K, Bullock had a wiser strategy.&nbsp; This time he let the varsity runners set the pace.&nbsp; Brian Gilligan '17 took first honors, coming through the 1600 in 4:55.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter Josh Rosenkranz '19 took control, holding pace for a 9:49 3200 split and continuing on to a 14:40 4800 and 15:15.26 for the victory.&nbsp; Alex Knoedler '18 took second in 15:38.60 while Ben Freed '18 finished in third in 15:54.02.&nbsp; Bullock's strategy was much more successful than what he employed in the Mile, finishing in fifth in 16:01.38.&nbsp; Other&nbsp;alums in the events were Benji Xie '15, Matt Jordan '15, Roy Wedge '14, Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11 and Joe Roy-Mayhew '08.</p>
            <p align="left">On the varsity side of things, the only double winner was Arinze Okeke '17.&nbsp; Okeke had a problem with fouls in both the Long Jump and Triple Jump, fouling three times in each event.&nbsp; Nevertheless, despite passing on three attempts between the two events, he won&nbsp;the Long Jump at 21-10 and then came back to take first place in the Triple with an excellent 48-2 3/4.&nbsp; Finishing a close second in both events was Billy Ruschel '18 at 21-6 and 47-5 3/4.&nbsp; Thad Wozniak '06 continued to defy father time as he placed third in the Long Jump at 20-6 1/2.&nbsp; Angle Echevarria '16 also competed in both events for the alums.</p>
            <p align="left">Other event&nbsp;winners were Tre Albritten '18&nbsp;in the 60 (7.15), Henry Tareque '17 in the 400 (52.94), Chris Sweeney '18 in the 60HH (8.48), Cody Bratten '18 in the Shot Put (42-8) and Albert Menio '20 in the Weight Throw (37-0 1/4).&nbsp; The varsity quartet of Albritten, Aidan Gilson '19, Tareque and Hannan took the 4x200 Relay in 1:35.04.</p>
            <p align="left">Other alums competing were Matt Barron '13&nbsp;in the 400 and Matt Falk '12 in the High Jump and Shot Put (placed second).&nbsp; Those in support were Nate Ball '05, Patrick Barragan '08, Javit Drake '94, Kimathi Hardy '97, Daniel Harper '12, Tom Hoover '05, Eric Khatchadourian '06, Nick Leonard '11, Allen Leung '15, Carrington Motley '16, and Omari Stephens '08.</p>
            <p align="left">The key event in the women's competition was the 1500.&nbsp; The NCAA went from the 1500 to the Mile for indoor track back in about 2006.&nbsp; We have not contested the 1500 indoors since then.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was time to make an attempt at taking Martha Buckley's '04 4:49.50 record down.&nbsp; Initially there was going to be an effort at totally changing the top 10 list, but minor injuries got in the way.&nbsp; Maryann Gong's first indoor 1500 was a beautiful thing to watch as she eased out to a pair of 77's as she led her varsity teammates in their quest.&nbsp; Feeling pretty good&nbsp;despite the tight turns of the MIT track, she dropped the pace to 73 and then a 54 for the final 300 to win in a new varsity record of 4:41.13.&nbsp; Blowing away Buckley's freshman record of 5:00.65 was Marissa Phillips '20 taking second in 4:49.33.&nbsp; Katie Bacher '20 placed third in 4:51.10.&nbsp; Altogether five of the top-10 all-time performances were replaced.&nbsp; Competing for the alums were Adrienne Bolger '09 and Maggie Lloyd '12.</p>
            <p align="left">Nneoma Okonkwo '18 not only set a varsity record, but also set the facility record when she won the Long Jump in 18-1.&nbsp; Not satisfied with one victory the junior won the 60 meter dash in 8.08.</p>
            <p align="left">The alumnae did quite well in the field events.&nbsp; Joanna Chen '15 beat out Jen Tylock '17 and Makenzie Patarino '19 by clearing 10-11 3/4.&nbsp;Also competing for the alums were Emily Cole '09, Caroline Figgatt '11 and Abby Klein '14.</p>
            <p align="left">Michelle Johnson '15 showed she still has it in the Triple Jump, as she took the event with a mark of 36-9 3/4.&nbsp; Jasmine Jin '20 took second in 36-2 1/4.&nbsp; Julia Sharpe '12 took third, and also took thirds in the Weight Throw and High Jump to show her versatility.</p>
            <p align="left">Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 won the High Jump by clearing 5-3&nbsp;3/4 and did so without any misses along the way.&nbsp; Natalie Alper '17 claimed second at 5-1 3/4.</p>
            <p align="left">The lone alumni winner in the running events was Alina Gatowski '11 as she scorched the varsity runners in the 5K.&nbsp; Gatowski settled in to 88&nbsp;second pace, barely slowing towards the end to win in a fine time of 18:16.87.&nbsp; Elaine McVay '15 paced herself much better than the varsity runners as she went from last to second in 18:48.24.&nbsp; Charlotte Folinus '20 closed well to take third in 18:52.25.</p>
            <p align="left">The most competitive race was the 800.&nbsp; Bailey Tregoning '19 scratched from the 1500 as her knee&nbsp;was feeling a little off, but loosened up by the time the 800 came around.&nbsp; Louise van den Heuvel '14, who won this battle last year, took the pace out fast, particularly for the 200 meter flat track.&nbsp; Her first 200 was a solid 32 and the 400 was a low 65.&nbsp; Tregoning was right on her heels.&nbsp; During the majority of the third lap Tregoning tried to go past but van den Heuvel was not letting her by.&nbsp; Finally Tregoning took the lead and pushed it home in 2:14.72 to van den Heuvel's 2:16.64.&nbsp; McPhillips doubled back with a third place 2:21.13.&nbsp; Alisha Schor '07 also competed in the event.</p>
            <p align="left">Other alumnae place winners were Isabella Stuopis '16 claiming second in the Shot Put (37-11&nbsp;3/4), Christine Labaza '14&nbsp;placing third in the Shot Put (34-4 3/4), Stephanie Birkhimer '15 earning third in the 60HH (10.49), Caroline Figgatt '11, taking third in the 200, and Alexandra Taylor '14 placing second in the 400.</p>
            <p align="left">Varsity winners were Ariela Slutsky '18 in the Weight Throw, setting a PR of 51-6 and taking the Shot Put with a throw of 38-11 1/2, Gabriella Zak '20 in the 200 (27.24), Jane Reed '20&nbsp;in the 400 (63.09), Hannah Chen '18 in the 60HH (9.72) and the quartet of Chen, Reed, Zak and Michelle Menkiti '20 taking the 4x200 Relay in 1:50.12</p>
            <p align="left">Alumnae giving support were Brooke Johnson '13, Veronica Szklarzewski '15, Catherine Tweedie '04, Cimmy Virdi '16, Ashley Wheeler '15 and Nicole Zeinstra '16.</p>
            <p align="left">Next week MIT begins their intercollegiate schedule with a home tri-meet against Bates and Colby.&nbsp; They will need for some of those not competing this weekend to be ready if they are to succeed against their Maine rivals.</p>
