              <p> January 17, 2009 </p>
              <p align="left">On Saturday, MIT traveled to Lewiston, Maine, home of the Bates Bearcats to face Bates and Colby in their first intercollegiate meet of the year on the newly renovated track. The Engineer's men and women were favored to win the <a href="bates-colby.res.html">tri-meet</a> and they did not disappoint with the men claiming the victory with 204 points to 128 for Bates and 21 for Colby, while the women earned theirs with 151 points to 123 for Bates and 89 for Colby. </p>
              <p align="left">As always, the field events began first. The MIT women, with only 27 competing, displayed their dominance in the first two events, the pole vault and high jump. The scoring for the three team meet awarded seven points for first, five for second, four for third, three for fourth, two for fifth and one for sixth. Emily Hwang '09, returned from her sprained ankle to earn first place with a vault of 10-11 1/2. Karin Fisher '11, Hazel Briner '11, and Lynn Jepsen '11, supported with second, third and fifth places to give MIT a commanding early lead. Over in the high jump, Portia Jones '12, led the way for MIT with a 5-0 1/4 second place effort and was helped by Briner and Amy Magnuson earning third and fourth places. After the two events MIT had a lead of 30 to 10 for Colby and 4 for Bates.</p>
              <p align="left">The running events resulted in a similar outcome with Jacqui Wentz '10, winning the mile in the second fastest indoor time ever for MIT, a 5:10.01 effort. Alicia Kaestli '12, and Katherine Eve '12 placed third and fourth respectively. On the infield straight, Magnuson and Jones went one-two in the 55HH, running 8.66 and 9.00.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT continued to pile up the victories and maintained their lead despite not having a lot of depth in most events. Andrea Bradshaw '09, won the 600 going away with a school record of 1:38.57. Wentz came back in the 1000 and again ran to victory in the second fastest MIT time ever with a 2:59.94. Jones earned her first victory of the day in the 200, winning comfortably in 27.62. Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, dueled teammate Jennifer Doyle '09, for much of the race, including a final sprint to win in 10:43.53 to Doyle's 10:43.65. The final victory was in the 4x200 relay as Martha Gross '12, Briner, AJ Williams '12, and Alex Manick '12, held on for a 1:56.11 win.</p>
              <p align="left">The men won 12 of the 16 events they entered and earned second place in nine of the 15 individual events. Stephen Morton '10, led the way with four victories for 28 points. Taking only three jumps in the long and triple, Morton made the most of the opportunity, jumping 22-3 and 47-5 3/4 for a strong NCAA provisional mark. On the track, Morton won both his specialties, the 55 and 200 in 6.63 and 23.04, giving suspicion that the new Mondo surface was a little slow due to its softness.</p>
              <p align="left">Morton was supported well in his events by Mattias Flander '11, in the long and triple jumps with efforts of 21-0 and 44-7 as well as a 6.87 in the 55,  Nathan Peterson '12, in the 55 (6.86) and Kahlil Dozier '12, in the 200 (23.54).</p>
              <p align="left">Tony McDonald '10, had a nice day in the throws, tossing the weight 47-7 1/4 for second place and earning the victory in the shot with a performance of 44-6 3/4. With James Oleinik '09, out for the year with a torn labrum, the young throwing unit (Adam Mustafa '11, Mitchell Kelley '11, Jared Darby '12, CK Umachi '12) stepped up to also claim 3-5-6 in the weight throw and 2-3-4-6 in the shot put. </p>
              <p align="left">On the track, other victories were earned by Dave Reshef 'G, in the 400 with a 53.09, Bill Phipps '10, in the 600 with a 1:24.67, Matt Bieniosek '09, in the 800 in 2:00.69, Jake Ruzevick '09, in the 1000 in 2:36.52, Yermie Cohen '09, in the 3000 with a 8:51.82 and the 4x400 with Reshef, Kevin Kleinguetl '11, Steven Serene '12, and Phipps running 3:35.01. </p>
              <p align="left">In perhaps the most thrilling victory of the day, Greg Tao '10, battled Sam Goldstein '12, from Bates in the pole vault. With both vaulters clearing personal indoor bests of 14-8 3/4 on their third attempt, both had close misses at 15-3. Neither vaulter cleared the height, giving Tao the victory based on fewer total misses.</p>
              <p align="left">Next weekend, both teams will compete at the Boston University Terrier Classic with the women competing on Friday and the men on Saturday.</p>
