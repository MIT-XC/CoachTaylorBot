              <p> January 10, 2009 </p>
              <p align="left">MIT began the season with victories over their more aged ex-team members, with the women claiming a 83-39 lopsided win and the men edging the &quot;Has Beens&quot; 70-52 in the annual <a href="alumni.res.html">Alumni Meet</a>.</p>
              <p align="left">Prior to the start of the meet, Donald Morrison '61, was honored with a dedication for his and his wife Sherie's generous gift of a second long jump / triple jump pit that will allow for much more time efficient meets, allowing the student-athletes to spend more time on the real reason they came to MIT, their academics. </p>
              <p align="left">On the women's side for the alums, Princess Imoukhuede '02, claimed two victories, throwing 50-3 1/4 in the weight throw and 36-7 1/2 in the shot put. Cat Tweedie '04, won the pole vault on misses with a vault of 10-6. </p>
              <p align="left">In the horizontal jumps, Meredith Silberstein '05 and Chinwe Nyenke '04 won the long jump and triple jump respectively with jumps of 15-0 3/4 and 33-11 1/2. </p>
              <p align="left">The alums were not able to claim any victories in the running events as the varsity showed their strength. Amy Magnuson '10 claimed a victory in the 55HH with a time of 8.50, and backed that up with an excellent 7.71 for second place in the 55 dash and another second in the high jump at 4-9 3/4.</p>
              <p align="left">Portia Jones '12, had an excellent first meet, taking two victories, a freshman record in the 200 in 27.50 and a 4-11 3/4 jump off in the high jump. She also anchored the victorious 4x200 in 27.5 and took a second in the 55HH with an 8.82. </p>
              <p align="left">Margaret Leibovic '10, won the 55 dash in 7.70, took second in the 200 in 27.57 and led off the successful 4x200 in 27.7.</p>
              <p align="left">Other victories were earned by Margaret Gross '12, in the 400 in 64.24, Andrea Bradshaw '09, in the 800 in 2:22.85, Katherine Eve '12, in the mile with a time of 5:18.75 and Maggie Lloyd '12, in the 5000 with a personal best of 19:12.88.</p>
              <p align="left">On the men's side of the ledger, the alums were led by Uzoma Orji '06, who dominated in the weight throw and shot put with victorious throws of 60-4 1/2 and 53-2 1/4 respectively. </p>
              <p align="left">Nate Ball '05, jumped 14-11 to take the pole vault, Craig Mielcarz '03, easily won the high jump at 6-2, Omari Stephens '08, claimed the 55HH in 8.18 and Ben Schmeckpeper '05, ran away with the 5000 in 15:23.01.</p>
              <p align="left">Stephen Morton '10, led the way for the varsity with four victories, one of them a personal best. Morton began his day with a 22-9 long jump, topped than with a PR of 6.54 in the 55 dash, came back in the 200 with a 22.93 and finished his day with a 45-0 1/2 triple jump victory for a total of 20 points.</p>
              <p align="left">Also claiming victories for the varsity were John Granata '11, in the 400 with a time of 52.99, Bill Phipps '10, in the 800 in 1:58.27, Yermie Cohen '09, in the mile with a negative split 4:27.43 and the 4x200 team of Matt Bieniosek '09, Granata, Nick Leonard '11 and Phipps, winning in 1:36.74.</p>
              <p align="left">Also representing the alums in the meet were Karen Davie '08, Chi-Fong Wang '07, Sarah Rich '08, Leanne Veldhuis '08, Alisha Schor '07, Adeline Kuo '02 and Julia Espel '05 for the women and Kevin Scannell '91, Thad Wozniak '06, Anthony Teixeira '08, Chris Bateman '07, Dan Kwon '02, Bill Singhose '90, Ravi Sastry '99, Ned Rich '72, Patrick Barragan '08, Craig Wildman '03, Chris Wong '08, Matt Lehman '03, David Blau '06, Akin Aina '95, Eric Khatchadourian '06, Peter Mulligan '08, Mike Lyons '85, Brian Jacokes '08, Joe Roy-Mayhew '08, Ian Driver '05, Bob Collins '82 and Don Shobrys '75. Many others were in attendance to cheer on their teammates. </p>
              <p align="left">Next week, the Engineers travel north to Lewiston, ME, home of the Bates Bobcats where they will go up against Bates and visiting Colby College. </p>
