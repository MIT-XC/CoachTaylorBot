  <p><strong><font size="+2">FINAL TUNEUP GETS MIT READY FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 14, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">MIT split their track team to take advantage of the best opportunities 
    in hopes of maximizing their chances of upsetting Williams and Tufts next 
    weekend for the New England Division III Championship. Most of the squad stayed 
    at home to compete in the annual Coed Invitational while select individuals 
    traveled across the river to Boston University to compete on their very fast 
    banked track.</p>
  <p align="left">Some outstanding performances were turned in at both venues. 
    At BU, Brian Anderson once again led the way. Anderson ran in a talent laden 
    mile section that pushed a fast pace throughout the race. Anderson ran with 
    the leaders through 1300 meters, then faded a little to finish in a PR of 
    4:10.11, the fastest time in the country for division III this year.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji did not have his best day, but still showed he can 
    throw well when things do not go his way. Orji finished 2nd in the shot put 
    with a throw of 56-9 1/4. Chris Khan continued to improve at an incredible 
    rate as he added nearly a foot to his personal best. Khan made the finals 
    and threw 49-9 3/4 on his final throw.</p>
  <p align="left">David Blau improved his personal best in the 200 by running 
    22.90. Amazingly, he did this without the use of blocks because meet management 
    only allowed the first three sections to use blocks.</p>
  <p align="left">Late in the meet, Ben Schmeckpeper took out his aggravation 
    of being placed in the developmental section of the 3000 out on the rest of 
    his section by running 8:30.85. Schmeckpeper's time was good enough to move 
    him into 3rd place on the all time list for MIT.</p>
  <p align="left">Back at MIT Josh Chartier showed his consistency by again vaulting 
    14'. Nate Ball jumped for the first time in over a month and cleared 13'. 
    The other field event outstanding performance was turned in by Francisco Cruz, 
    who threw 43-3 1/4 for his best throw this season.</p>
  <p align="left">On the track, Jonathan Hsieh ran a personal best in the 200 
    with a 23.75. Steve Kannan also ran a PR by racing to a 1:27.67 performance 
    in the 600. Marcus Carson knocked a hundredth off his 55HH best with a 8.28 
    performance. In his first collegiate race ever, graduate student Chris Fidkowski, 
    ran an outstanding 1500 in 4:12.40. Fidkowski will undoubtedly add to his 
    cross country success by having a great outdoor season. Last, but not least, 
    Kevin Brulois made a breakthrough in the 5000 with a fine performance of 15:53.78.</p>
  <p align="left">With injuries to Zach Traina (sprints), Matt Lehman (400), Nestor 
    Hernandez (LJ, PV), John Brewer (long relays) and Fivos Constantinou (long 
    relays), there is no doubt that MIT will enter next weekend's championship 
    as distinct underdogs. However, it has always been Tech's tradition to step 
    up when needed and it certainly seems to be needed. The New England Division 
    III Championship will be held at Bowdoin College on Friday and Saturday, February 
    20-21.</p>
