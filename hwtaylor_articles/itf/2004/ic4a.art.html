  <p><strong><font size="+3">ORJI AND BALL TOP THE MIT EFFORTS AT IC4A AND ECAC 
    CHAMPIONSHIPS</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">March 7, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">MIT split their athletes up this weekend, sending Brian Anderson 
    and Uzoma Orji to the IC4A Championship at Boston University and Nate Ball, 
    Josh Chartier and Ben Schmeckpeper to the ECAC Division III Championship at 
    Bowdoin College. MIT made the most of the entries by scoring 13 points at 
    the ECAC meet and 10 points at the IC4A meet.</p>
  <p align="left">Schmeckpeper, an entry in the 5000 meters, was the first to 
    compete. He had qualified for the IC4A meet by virtue of his 14:39 performance 
    the week before. Because he was ranked only 15th nationally, he wanted to 
    give it another try since the NCAA only takes 10-11 per event. The 5000 at 
    the IC4A Championship is held on Sunday. The NCAA Division III policies dictate 
    that all qualifying marks have to be in by 11:59 PM on Saturday the 6th of 
    March. The ECAC 5000 is held on Friday, so the decision was made. Having already 
    run two quality 5Ks in the past two weeks, Schmeckpeper was possibly a little 
    fatigued, mentally if not physically. After 1600 splits of 4:43 and 4:46, 
    it was obvious he was not on his A game. Schmeckpeper finished in 5th place 
    with a time of 15:04.84 and will have to wait until the outdoor season to 
    try and qualify for the national championship.</p>
  <p align="left">In the Pole Vault, Nate Ball and Josh Chartier attempted to 
    gain national qualifying marks. Chartier could not put it all together and 
    was only able to clear 13-5 3/4. Ball got his step back after being injured 
    for more than two months and jumped 15-5 1/2. His mark was good enough to 
    qualify for nationals, but only provisionally. They too will have to wait 
    for the outdoor season.</p>
  <p align="left">At the IC4A meet, Anderson was entered in the 800 and Orji in 
    both the Weight Throw and the Shot Put. Anderson did not have a definite game 
    plan in mind and it showed once the trials began. He could not decide if he 
    wanted to go for a time by running from the front, or running from behind 
    and closing hard at the end. Instead he went back and forth a few times from 
    the front to the back, all in lane three. By the time the race pace picked 
    up Anderson was done, finishing in 1:55.05.</p>
  <p align="left">Orji competed in the Weight Throw first. He was seeded 9th and 
    hoped to make finals and put together a big throw to place well. His first 
    throw was 57-9 and that was as good as it got, which placed him a very respectable 
    seventh. His two season experience with the 35lb. implement is just inadequate 
    to put a big throw together but he is hoping to do so at the NCAA Division 
    III Championship where he is seeded sixth.</p>
  <p align="left">The Shot Put was Sunday and Orji brought a different set of 
    expectations to the table. Seeded third, Orji held true to his seed in the 
    trials, throwing 56-1 3/4. In the finals, before Orji could take his turn 
    he was already back to fifth place. He responded to move back to third place. 
    On his fifth throw of the competition, he got most of one and threw 57-7 to 
    move into second place. Orji went for it all on his final attempt but left 
    his back leg and did not get any lift. Nevertheless, scoring 10 points and 
    placing in two events is pretty good for a sophomore. Orji is seeded number 
    one at nationals in the shot and is determined to make it stand.</p>
