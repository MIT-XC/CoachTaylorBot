  <p><strong><font size="+2">MIT RUNS AWAY WITH GREATER BOSTON CHAMPIONSHIP AS 
    THE ANDERSON AND ORJI SHOW CONTINUES</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">February 7, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">It was Brian Anderson Day at the Harvard Track on Saturday as 
    Anderson won his customary two events and ran a great anchor leg of the mile 
    relay to lead MIT to the Greater Boston Championship. MIT came out on top 
    with 144 points to 116 for Harvard, 95 for Bentley and 80 for Brandeis.</p>
  <p align="left">Despite holding out key performers (Nate Ball - pole vault, 
    Nestor Hernandez - long jump, pole vault, Chris Khan - weight throw, Matt 
    Lehman - 400 and Zach Traina - 55, 200) due to injuries that are not quite 
    ready for competitive situation, MIT won seven of 16 events, four with national 
    level performances.</p>
  <p align="left">Anderson started his day with the mile run. Running splits of 
    62, 2:03 and 3:05, he opened up a 60 meter gap on the rest of the field. Tying 
    up a little at the end, Anderson could only finish in 66 to win in an indoor 
    personal best of 4:11.87. Four events later, Anderson was back on the track 
    in the 800. Running behind for a total of 150 meters, Anderson took the lead 
    and came through the first 200 in 27. He even split the 400, running 55 for 
    the 400. Slowing a little he ran 28 and 29 for the final two laps to finish 
    in 1:52.88. Both performances are national qualifying marks. In the mile relay, 
    running from behind without the services of Lehman and Traina, Anderson ran 
    his first 400 of the season in 49.7 to nearly make up the 15 meter difference 
    on the Bentley runner and bring the team in a season best time of 3:27.60. 
    The 3:27 converts to a 1600 time of 3:26.50.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji did not set any PRs but he still won both of his 
    specialties quite easily. In the weight throw, Orji threw 58-1 3/4 to win 
    by over eight feet. In the shot put, he threw 55-3 to beat the best Harvard 
    thrower by over three feet. Chris Khan did compete in the shot even though 
    he gave his injured back a rest in the weight throw and came through with 
    a fine effort of 48-8 to claim fourth.</p>
  <p align="left">Josh Chartier decided he likes winning as he cleared 13-5 3/4 
    to take first in the pole vault. He nearly cleared 14-3 on his second attempt 
    and on landing bit through his lip, which ended his day of competition. Marcus 
    Carson also claimed his first victory for MIT with a time of 9.06 in the 60 
    meter hurdles. Carson had a slow start but finished very fast to claim first 
    place. The final Tech winner was Ben Schmeckpeper in the 5000. Schmeckpeper 
    went out a little too fast in the first 400 and after mile splits of 4:37 
    and 9:28 could no longer maintain the pace. Schmeckpeper finished in a season 
    best of 15:05.60.</p>
  <p align="left">Next weekend, MIT will split its squad, sending a few of the 
    top competitors to BU for the Fastrack Invitational and keeping the rest at 
    home in MIT's Coed Invitational.</p>
