  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT Unable to Take Down Favored Tufts</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 31, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">MIT Men's Track and Field team came to Bowdoin College with 
    the hopes and expectations of upsetting a deep and talented team from Tufts 
    University. Despite some remarkable performances and gifts from Tufts, injuries 
    and disappointing distance event performances did them in. When it was all 
    said and done the Jumbos managed 133 points to 123 for MIT and 118 for Bowdoin, 
    who managed to improve significantly in this meet to challenge for the team 
    victory.</p>
  <p align="left">When 600 runner Jesse Alejandro missed the bus and meet it put 
    the Engineers in a hole for their relays. Tufts was favored by 25 points going 
    into the meet but had a significant setback when their star freshman horizontal 
    jumper was unable to compete due to an injury, which was worth about 10-15 
    points when all things were considered. MIT went into the meet without star 
    vaulter, Nate Ball and middle distance runner John Brewer, but the team seemed 
    prepared to step up and get the job done.</p>
  <p align="left">In the first events things seemed to be going in Tech's favor. 
    In the 55HH trials, all three MIT hurdlers made the finals and both Marcus 
    Carson and Bo Feng set personal bests. In the dash trials, MIT swept 1-4 with 
    Zach Traina leading the way with a season best 6.67. With the scoring determined 
    to be 7-5-4-3-2-1 in individual events and relays 7-5-0, MIT's sprint depth 
    would be key if they were to win the meet.</p>
  <p align="left">In the first final, the triple jump, MIT took advantage of a 
    weak field, inserting a couple of rookies who performed nicely, giving MIT 
    2nd, 3rd and 5th. However, on his third attempt, Traina, the one jumper who 
    has been performing every week, pulled his hamstring. This eliminated him 
    from the dash finals, the 200 where he was the favorite and the 4x400.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT kept their spirits up and kept fighting. In the pole vault, 
    Josh Chartier jumped a personal best of 14-1 to take the victory. Nestor Hernandez 
    secured 2nd place while Tufts had two no heights, one from the vaulter favored 
    to win the event.</p>
  <p align="left">Hernandez enjoyed short lived success however. Proceeding over 
    to the long jump, which he was favored to win, Hernandez took a conservative 
    first attempt of 20-11 3/4 to take the lead. On his second attempt, he pulled 
    his hamstring, and had to settle for second place in the event.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji left nothing to doubt in the 35 lb. weight throw. 
    Any of his throws would have won the event, but his best of 58-6 3/4 won by 
    about seven feet. One of the reasons he won by such a long distance was that 
    teammate, Chris Khan, still suffering from back pain, only took two throws. 
    On his first attempt, Khan threw 49-3 1/2, good enough for second place at 
    the time. He decided to pass his attempts unless someone passed him. A Tufts 
    thrower did just that on his final attempt and Khan was unable to respond 
    with a fair throw.</p>
  <p align="left">On the track, things could not be going better. In the mile, 
    Brian Anderson led from start to finish in a sterling time of 4:15.94. Fivos 
    Constantinou supported the effort with his own personal best of 4:25.54, good 
    for 4th place. In the high hurdles, Carson and Feng again ran personal bests 
    of 8.29 and 8.55 respectively.</p>
  <p align="left">At this point, the score was MIT 56, Bowdoin 52 and Tufts 44. 
    Bowdoin had dominated the high jump with 16 of the possible 22 points and 
    was hoping to do similar damage in the 400. Tufts' Ray Carre defeated a trio 
    of Bowdoin runners at the wire, but Bowdoin still managed 13 points to take 
    a seven point lead over MIT.</p>
  <p align="left">The 600 was a little more evenly split thanks to a big effort 
    by Tech's Jesse Collins, who cracked MIT's top ten list with a 3rd place effort 
    of 1:25.02. Nevertheless, Bowdoin managed nine points to MIT's five to expand 
    their lead to 11 points. Tufts was back at 59, but once the distance events 
    came around they would take the lead if they were close enough beforehand.</p>
  <p align="left">Without Traina in the dash final, MIT could only manage 1-2-4 
    for fifteen points. This brought MIT to within two points, but not the hoped 
    for lead. David Blau's winning time of 6.75 was a season best. Freshmen Jonathan 
    Hsieh and Carson placed second and fourth respectively, sandwiching a Bowdoin 
    runner who ran a great race for third.</p>
  <p align="left">Anderson was back in the 800 to keep Bowdoin and Tufts at bay, 
    but without Brewer, only Constantinou would be able to do battle with the 
    leaders in the 1000. Anderson did his job by leading from start to finish 
    with an evenly split 1:55.91 season best. Steve Stoddard stepped up and ran 
    a season best of 2:02.06 for fourth place to give MIT 10 points in the event, 
    out pointing Bowdoin and Tufts with six points each. Constantinou did his 
    job, running a three second PR of 2:37.76 but could only manage third place. 
    No other MIT runners ran well and Tufts took advantage, scoring 16 points. 
    MIT was able to take the lead with 92 points to 88 for Bowdoin and 82 for 
    Tufts. </p>
  <p align="left">The 200, along with the shot put were supposed to put the meet 
    away if the distance runners could hold their own. Without Traina, MIT was 
    counting on Matt Lehman and David Blau to take care of business. After a great 
    start, Lehman made it about halfway down the backstretch before pulling his 
    hamstring. The third pull of the day made MIT athletes think a little more 
    than bad luck was going on. Blau was able to secure 3rd and Wozniak 5th, but 
    it was no where near what the Engineers expected. Instead of the six points 
    they scored, MIT would have had at least 13 and Tufts would have scored four 
    less. This 11 point swing would have been enough to win the meet.</p>
  <p align="left">Normally, a regular season meet only has either the 3000 or 
    5000 but not both. Having both races certainly worked to Tufts advantage and 
    they did their best to seize the moment. Between the two events there were 
    a possible 44 points. In part, due to poor running on the part of some of 
    MIT's normally reliable distance runners, but mostly due to their own depth 
    and ability, Tufts scored 28 points in the two events compared to six to MIT 
    and 10 for Bowdoin. Tufts took a 16 point lead over MIT and Bowdoin.</p>
  <p align="left">With Traina and Lehman out of the 1600 relay, MIT put together 
    a team with no chance to win but running in case one of the other teams did 
    not finish or got disqualified. Neither Bowdoin, nor Tufts disappointed, running 
    superb times of 3:24.04 and 3:25.28 respectively. Bowdoin now had a seven 
    point lead over MIT and Tufts could not be caught.</p>
  <p align="left">The shot put was finishing up about the same time as the 3200 
    relay was getting under way. Uzoma Orji added another two feet to his best, 
    throwing a nation leading 57-11 3/4 to easily win the event. Khan supported 
    the MIT effort with his own personal best of 48-11 for second place. Bowdoin 
    scored seven points to MIT's 12 to maintain a two point lead.</p>
  <p align="left">When it was clear MIT could not put together a scoring team 
    in the 1600 relay they elected to load up their 4x800 to make sure they could 
    win the event. If they won the event, the worst that would happen is they 
    would tie Bowdoin for second place in the meet. If Tufts also placed ahead 
    of Bowdoin, MIT would finish in second by five points.</p>
  <p align="left">Stoddard started things off with a solid 2:03.5 first 800, handing 
    the stick off just ahead of Tufts. Collins ran his first 800 of the year, 
    maintaining a small lead over Tufts by running 2:05.0. Constantinou continued 
    with his superb meet by running 2:02.1, providing Anderson with a five meter 
    lead going into the final leg. Anderson ran 29 for each 200, posting a 1:56.3 
    anchor to win by four seconds over Tufts and 14 over Bowdoin. </p>
  <p align="left">Ending the regular season with a 5-2 record was the worst record 
    since 1996, when MIT last lost to Tufts. Nevertheless, the Engineers knew 
    this was a possibility and now must look forward to the championships, where 
    they hope to do better riding the tails of Orji and Anderson. Next week, MIT 
    travels to Harvard to compete in the Greater Boston Championship against Harvard, 
    Northeastern, Bentley and Brandeis.</p>
