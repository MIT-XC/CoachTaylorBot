  <p><strong><font size="+3">ENGINEERS CONSTRUCT NARROW VICTORY OVER BATES AND 
    COAST GUARD</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 17, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">MIT knows it is going to be a long season, but having to pull 
    out all the stops in order to claim a victory in the first meet has already 
    made the season a little longer. Favored by perhaps 20 points over host Bates 
    College and the United States Coast Guard Academy, MIT dropped the ball in 
    a few events, giving the Bobcats of Bates life that was not extinguished until 
    the final event. Bates needed little assistance as they were already fired 
    up knowing they had a chance to take down the unusually weak Engineers for 
    the first time since 1983.</p>
  <p align="left">The MIT team arrived a little late for a proper warmup and the 
    youth of the jumpers exacerbated that fact as they became distracted by having 
    to get marks in so many events. The scoring for the tri-meet would go 7-5-4-3-2-1 
    for individual events and 7-5-0 for the relays. The long jump, pole vault 
    and high jump all started at 1:00 as well as the weight throw and 55 dash 
    trials. Four of the Tech jumpers were involved in some combination of at least 
    two of the jumping events and one in three events going off at the same time. 
    Nestor Hernandez handled the situation the best as he won the long jump with 
    a leap of 20-5 and placed second in the pole vault with a personal best of 
    13-6. Marcus Carson made the finals of the 55, nearly placed in the high jump 
    and placed 5th in the long jump. However, overall MIT came out of the jumps 
    down 27 to 31 to Bates.</p>
  <p align="left">In the throws, Uzoma Orji continued his early season dominance 
    by winning both the shot put and the weight throw. In the weight, Orji unleashed 
    a personal best of 57-1 1/2 on his fifth effort to up his national qualifying 
    mark. In the shot, Orji put the event away on his second effort after he fouled 
    the first attempt. In the finals he increased his mark to 55-0 1/4. Chris 
    Khan gave support despite his injured back. Not able to give 100% on his release, 
    Khan had to settle for 4th place in both events. After all field events, the 
    Engineers were down 47to 54 to the Bobcats.</p>
  <p align="left">The first running event, the 1500, was supposed to go MIT's 
    way. While Brian Anderson won easily in a sit and kick 4:04.17, Ben Schmeckpeper 
    (3rd in 4:09.61), John Brewer (5th in 4:11.73) and Fivos Constantinou (6th 
    in 4:18.02) did not fare so well, scoring four less points than predicted. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Freshmen Bo Feng and Marcus Carson led MIT in the 55HH and with 
    only six entrants they would both score provided they finished the race. Both 
    have been having some difficulty making the adjustment to the 42&quot; hurdles 
    and were hoping for a good race. Bates hurdlers took advantage of a weak field, 
    placing 1-2-3 and garnering 16 points. Feng and Carson placed fourth and fifth 
    respectively, both with personal bests of 8.82 and 8.92. The score now 73 
    to 66 in favor of Bates.</p>
  <p align="left">Matt Lehman was favored to win the 400 and he did not disappoint. 
    Lehman led from gun to finish, winning by well over a second in 51.08. Thad 
    Wozniak was expected to place high in the weak field but was distracted when 
    the gun was fired before he was allowed to get set in the blocks. He never 
    really recovered, finishing last in his section, but placing sixth overall 
    for one point. Bates only finished second and fifth so were not able to take 
    advantage of MIT's performance.</p>
  <p align="left">The 600 meter race was also expected to go well for MIT, but 
    between Jesse Alejandro, Jesse Collins and Chris Tostado not following their 
    race plan, and Alejandro developing a tremendously painful blister on the 
    ball of his foot, Tech only managed a second, fifth and sixth while Bates 
    claimed first place. Between the two events (400 and 600), MIT managed to 
    pick up two points to close within five.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina probably took one more triple jump than he should 
    have prior to the 55 dash because he ran one hundredth slower than the trials, 
    giving way to Bates top sprinter, Joel Colony, who ran 6.67 for the victory. 
    David Blau stepped up for third place and Jonathan Hsieh ran well for sixth. 
    Bates sprinters supported their victory with fourth and fifth place as well, 
    gaining back the two points they had lost to MIT in the previous two events 
    and moving their lead back to seven points.</p>
  <p align="left">Bates did not have many entrants in the 800 and 1000 meter events, 
    making it possible for MIT to make up a lot of points. In the 800, Steve Stoddard 
    attempted to run with the Coast Guard entrants, but could not hang with Mike 
    Flint of the Bears. Stoddard was able to stay in contact through nearly 600 
    meters, but then fell back, just holding on for second place. Constantinou 
    doubled back in the 800 and managed a 5th place to pick up a total of six 
    points on Bates. Anderson put it in high gear at the gun of the 1000 and never 
    backed off, running a very fine 2:31.78, winning by over five seconds. Unfortunately, 
    Brewer was not able to help out much, and lost to a Bates runner right at 
    the finish line, settling for fifth place. Sam Berberian added a sixth place 
    for Tech, helping MIT take the lead by six points.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT gained another two points in the 200, not nearly as many 
    as they should have gained on Bates' fast track. Traina took advantage of 
    the outside lane, running a season best of 23.00 to easily win the event. 
    Lehman was not able to claim second as he gave up to much ground at the start, 
    but he did manage a third place. The worst part is that MIT's other three 
    participants were not able to score when they should have been able to .</p>
  <p align="left">Going into the final individual event, MIT knew that if Bates 
    cut the lead to within seven points in the 3000, then MIT would have to try 
    to spread their relays out with hopes of winning both the 4x400 and the 4x800, 
    or at least beating Bates in both of them. This would mean bringing back some 
    tired middle distance runners for the 4x800 and weakening the 4x400 in the 
    process. Favorite Ben Schmeckpeper was unable to push a fast pace and thus 
    fell to Joel Anderson of Bates. Only managing 72 second quarters, the leaders 
    nevertheless pulled away from a very weak field. In the end, Anderson's 8:52.02 
    gave Bates the victory to which they also added fourth and sixth place. Schmeckpeper 
    managed to run 8:55.96 for second and was supported by Eric Khatchadourian 
    in third. Bates gained two points, meaning the meet would come down to the 
    relays.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT went wire to wire in the 4x400 relay and thanks to Lehman's 
    50.4 anchor, it was not really close. Bates finished 2nd to fall seven points 
    behind MIT. The Engineers knew that if Bates won the 4x800 and MIT finished 
    third, the meet would end in a tie. Brewer began his third race as the leadoff 
    runner. Running his best race of the day, Brewer went with the Bates runner. 
    Coast Guard pulled out to a big lead but Brewer stayed within a second of 
    the Bates runner at the handoff. Stoddard lost more ground to Coast Guard 
    after his first quarter but stayed within three seconds of the Bates second 
    leg. Constantinou ran a tremendous leg, closing the gap on Bates with a 28 
    first 200 and 58 first quarter. Not backing off, Constantinou pulled around 
    the Bates runner and opened up a nice gap, finishing with an excellent 2:02 
    leg. Brian Anderson, prepared to make up a large gap, could not shut his adrenalin 
    off. Anderson opened up with splits of 26 and 53 seconds, closing the gap 
    on Coast Guard. Slowing down little, Anderson ran 1:54 to give MIT the event, 
    the team victory and an 8:05.61 time.</p>
  <p align="left">Things don't get any easier for MIT next week when they travel 
    to Williamstown to take on the host Ephs and the Engineers from RPI on Saturday 
    at 2:00.</p>
