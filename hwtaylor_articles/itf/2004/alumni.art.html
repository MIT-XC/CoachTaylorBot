  <p><strong><font size="+3">LED BY FOUR NATIONAL QUALIFYING PERFORMANCES, THE 
    VARSITY WINS THE 30TH ANNUAL ALUMNI MEET</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">January 10, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">The 30th annual alumni meet combined with a dinner honoring 
    Gordon Kelly for 42 years of coaching and teaching brought out the alumni 
    in record numbers. Thirty-five alumni competed in official meet events and 
    a few more in the master's mile. Many more were in attendance to cheer on 
    the &quot;Has Beens&quot; who made a tremendous effort that fell a little 
    short of victory as they lost to the Varsity 72 to 59.</p>
  <p align="left">Over the past few months there had been a lot of electronic 
    &quot;trash talk&quot; from the two camps as the fun, but competitive contest 
    heated up. The most recent graduates assumed they would be able to make the 
    difference between victory and defeat. Most of the events were pretty clear 
    cut prior to competition. There was little doubt the Alumni would sweep the 
    pentathlon, high jump and high hurdles. Although they were expected to sweep 
    the triple jump and long jump as well, there was some hope by the Varsity 
    that one or more of the old timers would have a senior moment and forget how 
    to perform the event. The Varsity were expected to sweep the 55 dash and 200 
    as well as win the relay. It was hoped the Varsity would also take the top 
    two places in the shot put and weight throw. The biggest doubt was the annual 
    battle between Sean Montgomery '01 and Brian Anderson '04, which Montgomery 
    has owned in the past.</p>
  <p align="left">In the morning the meet started off with a pentathlon. The Varsity 
    went to bat with two rookies, Thad Wozniak and Marcus Carson. The Alumni brought 
    in former New England Division III Champions Craig Mielcarz and Rick Rajter 
    as well as place winner Tony Pelosi. Wozniak gave Pelosi all he wanted but 
    was not strong enough in the 1000 meter run, losing third place by 59 points. 
    Rajter won the event with 3076 points to spot the Alumni to a 9-0 lead</p>
  <p align="left">The first event of the afternoon session was the weight throw. 
    As expected, Chris Khan and Uzoma Orji were in the lead from the second round 
    although Todd Chamoy represented the Alumni well, throwing 51-5.25 for third 
    place. Khan passed Orji on his final throw to take the victory with a toss 
    of 54-02.5. Both Khan and Orji (53-11.5) qualified provisionally for nationals.</p>
  <p align="left">In the long jump, what may have turned out to be the pivotal 
    upset in the meet occurred when Nestor Hernandez leaped 20-11 to take the 
    victory from a group of alumni jumpers, Ravi Sastry, Kevin Scannell, Mielcarz 
    and Rajter. This was the break the Varsity was hoping for and pulled the current 
    Engineers to within 1 point.</p>
  <p align="left">As expected, the high jump and triple jump were swept by the 
    Alumni. In the high jump, Sastry led the way with a jump of 5-10 and was followed 
    by Rajter with 5-8 and Mielcarz with 5-6. They could have jumped higher if 
    necessary but the Varsity could not pose a threat even at those heights. Zach 
    Traina, the lone entrant in the triple jump for the Varsity, nearly stole 
    third place with a leap of 39-9.5, but Scannell passed him on his last attempt 
    to provide the Alumni with another sweep. </p>
  <p align="left">Orji and Khan went back to work in the shot put, again placing 
    first and second. Orji had an amazing series, breaking his own school record 
    on four of his six throws, finishing with a new record of 55-4.5. Orji's throw 
    was a provisional national qualifying mark and should certainly get him to 
    the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater in March. Khan had an indoor personal 
    best with a throw of 47-2.5. The Varsity nearly got a sweep when Francisco 
    Cruz threw 40-5.75 for fourth, but Pat Dannen unleashed a 42-3.5 effort to 
    take third place.</p>
  <p align="left">Nate Ball won the pole vault for the varsity with a leap of 
    14-0, but pulled his hamstring in the process. Bill Singhose, former national 
    decathlon champion and pole vault All America winner, was too injured to compete. 
    Dan Kwon was able to jump 13-0 for second place for the Alumni while Josh 
    Chartier claimed 3rd. for the Varsity. After all field events, including the 
    pentathlon, the Alumni were up 36 to 27.</p>
  <p align="left">On the track, Anderson began his first battle with Montgomery 
    in the 1500. Former national champion, Ethan Crain, who had not been training, 
    tried to fool everyone into thinking he had by going out hard at the start 
    and coming through in 62 for the first quarter. Anderson went with him and 
    when Crain fell off the pace, decided to keep pushing it. Montgomery hoped 
    to pull up on Anderson but the pace did not slow down as Anderson came through 
    1200 meters in 3:10 en route to finishing with a national provisional qualifying 
    time of 3:57.18. Montgomery held on for second and John Brewer came through 
    for the Varsity with a 4:10.09 third place.</p>
  <p align="left">As expected the 55HH was an easy sweep for the Alumni despite 
    a tired Rajter and Mielcarz. Sastry won his second event with a time of 8.17. 
    The Alumni had amassed 48 points to the Varsity's 33 but the best was yet 
    to come for the Varsity who would not lose another event.</p>
  <p align="left">In the 400, Matt Lehman ran a remarkable 51.06 for the Varsity 
    to edge Yuval Mazor for the Alumni, who ran 51.91. Jesse Collins, a sophomore 
    who did not run as a freshmen, ran 52.51 for third.</p>
  <p align="left">The dash went even better than expected for the Varsity. Traina 
    led a four man sweep to victory with a 6.74 performance. Akin Aina led the 
    upset attempt for the Alumni but an earlier injury had prevented him from 
    practicing, allowing him no better than a 7.06.</p>
  <p align="left">The 800 brought about the second battle between Anderson and 
    Montgomery. Anderson put the exclamation on the switching of the guard as 
    he went wire to wire in 1:56.71 for the victory. Mark Jeunette and Montgomery 
    ran well to defeat Steve Stoddard of the Varsity to gain four points for the 
    Alumni, keeping the Alumni up 55 to 53.</p>
  <p align="left">The 200 was a duplication of the dash, giving the Varsity another 
    sweep of the first four places. Traina again led the way, matching Anderson 
    with two victories, with a time of 23.30. Lehman supported Traina's effort 
    with a fine time of 23.34. The Varsity finally had the lead again and intended 
    to keep it with only the 5000 and 4x200 remaining.</p>
  <p align="left">The Alumni had put together a distance group capable of retaking 
    the lead with the ageless Terry McNatt, Craig Wildman and Josh Feldman. They 
    ran together and eventually wore down the Varsity contingent with the exception 
    of Ben Schmeckpeper. Schmeckpeper pushed the pace early, running 72s for the 
    first two and half miles, eventually running 15:10.61 for the win, clinching 
    the team victory.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's next meet is against Bates and Coast Guard at Bates on 
    January 17th at 1:00. With the injury to Ball and most of the Engineer's jumpers 
    and multi-eventers not participating this season, all competitions will be 
    difficult. MIT has not lost a regular season meet since 2001.</p>
