            <p align="left">February 8-9, 2019</p>
            <p align="left">On day one of the <a href="valentines.res.php">Boston University David Hemery Valentines Invitational</a> and the start of day two, the women representing MIT competed amazingly well.&nbsp; All in all the women came away with three NCAA Division III qualifying performances, an MIT record and a few MIT top ten all-time performances.</p>
            <p align="left">Margaret Trautner '20, already qualified for Nationals in the 800, moved to the 1000 to test her ability to run the 1200 leg of the Distance Medley Relay.&nbsp; The junior ran an outstanding race, going out in 33.0, taking the lead later in the race when it slowed and won going away with a new MIT record of 2:54.92.&nbsp; This should give her confidence in being able to handle the DMR leg the next day.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 400, Sarah Ishamuddin '21, recently tried the event to try and provide a strong leg for the DMR, teamed with veteran Kristen Frombach '19 they were racing to see who would be the best for the position.&nbsp; For both it was the first time on a banked track.&nbsp; Ishamuddin raced first, went out in 28.3, ran a great backstretch until she cut her momentum at the end of the straight because she did not plan her pass well.&nbsp; She accelerated again, but it took a little out of her.&nbsp; Nevertheless she ran 60.06.&nbsp; Frombach also got out well in 28.8, but seemed flat and unable to take advantage of the banked turns.&nbsp; She finished in 61.94.</p>
            <p align="left">Marissa McPhillips '20 was out to improve her Mile time to guarantee a national&nbsp;qualifying mark.&nbsp; She was in a fast section and let them do the work.&nbsp; Her&nbsp;first 440 was 72.4&nbsp;and her second a 73.9.&nbsp; She maintained that pace&nbsp;through a 3:40.1 3200 then fell off just a bit in the final two laps to run a&nbsp;Mile personal best of 4:55.05.&nbsp; A time that should certainly get her into the national championship.&nbsp; Tessa Weiss '20 ran in a later section and also raced well, but not to her potential.&nbsp; The junior went out well in 75.2, but then did not take charge when the pace slowed&nbsp;to splits of 2:32.7 and 3:51.2.&nbsp; She finished in a season best 5:09.71, moving in the right direction.</p>
            <p align="left">At the end of the first evening Tech had two in the 5K; Katie Collins '21 and Jenna Melanson '20.&nbsp; Both were racing to finish as close to 17:00 as possible and beat as many as possible in the process.&nbsp; The goal was 81-82 second 400's.&nbsp; Collins and Melanson were perfect through a 5:25 first 1600.&nbsp; In the second 1600 Melanson started to fall off at the end as she came through in 10:56 to Collins's 10:55.&nbsp; Collins refocused as she had fallen to two straight 83's.&nbsp; She ran 82's the rest of the way until the final 600 where she ran 40 second 200's the rest of the way to a 17:01.78.&nbsp; Melanson fell off with a final 1600 of 5:47, but closed with a 42 final 200 to show she lost focus in the final 1600.</p>
            <p align="left">While the second day was the men's day, the one exception was the women's DMR at the start of the meet.&nbsp; MIT was in the fast section based on last year's performance as they had not run one this season.&nbsp; Trautner was the leadoff for the 1200 leg.&nbsp; She positioned herself towards the back of the 12 team field.&nbsp; The initial pace was  just off the 35.0 goal at 35.7.&nbsp; She went around a few runners and hit the 400 split in 70.6.&nbsp; Somewhere towards the end of the 600 she started thinking, which took her mentally out of the race a bit.&nbsp; She remained competitive and finished strong in 3:35.2.&nbsp; Ishamuddin had a clean exchange and ran an excellent leg, handing off in 59.0.&nbsp; Bailey Tregoning '19, who the day before had gotten caught up in a very slow, strategic 800 that finished in 2:15, and typically tries to make up deficits in the first 200, was very patient.&nbsp; Even though she was behind the next runner by 25 meters at the handoff, she gradually moved up as she split the first 400 in 64.3.&nbsp; Although she fell off a little in the final 400 she split 2:11.7 to put the Engineers in a great position for McPhillips to do her thing.&nbsp; In sixth place with five Division I teams in front of her, the junior moved up slowly.&nbsp; However, moving up slowly brought her through a 70.5 first 400, which was way too fast.&nbsp; She showed her strength by not falling apart.&nbsp; Although she did not move into the top five despite a 2:24 800 and 3:40 1200, she did finish in 4:55.2 to anchor her team in 11:41.25, currently the fastest time in Division III.</p>
            <p align="left">The men began with the 800.&nbsp; Aiden Foucault-Etheridge '22 was Tech's first competitor.&nbsp; The freshman had missed a few weeks of racing due to a tweaked hamstring, so was unsure how things would go.&nbsp; To his credit he did not consider that an issue and raced well.&nbsp; With the exception of making a big pass on the turn, having to go out to lane three, after 500 meters, he raced well and nearly won as he was caught at the finish&nbsp;in a 1:54.45.&nbsp; Reed Foster '22, another freshman who had missed some time due to injury was in a similar position, racing for the first time&nbsp;this season.&nbsp; Foster also raced with good instincts with the exception of making passes on three of the four turns.&nbsp; He pulled away in the final lap, running a 1:55.28.</p>
            <p align="left">Nick Duchatellier '22 was up next in the 400.&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting a better feel for collegiate indoor running and a better sense of pacing, the freshman went out in control, positioned himself well at the break in 23.0 and proceeded to run 49.85, almost pulling out the section victory.</p>
            <p align="left">Alec Reduker '20 was the sole field event competitor for MIT.&nbsp; Competing in the High Jump, the All American was able to clear 6-6 3/4, but did not clear 6-8 1/4 despite two good attempts.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 200, Benton Wilson '21 improved his time to 21.82, which currently ranks him 10th on the DIII national list.</p>
            <p align="left">Up in the 1000 were Simon Alford '20 and Billy Woltz '20.&nbsp; Alford, the defending New England Division III Champion, was cautious at the start in order to avoid taking the lead as he was in&nbsp;the outside lane in a two turn stagger.&nbsp; He ran an excellent race from the back, hitting even splits to come through the 800 in 1:59.7, but never had his notorious kick, finishing in 2:30.07, a nice season best, but lacking something at the end.&nbsp; Woltz, trying to find the right event this season as he has range from 800 to 5K, ran a strong 1000.&nbsp;&nbsp;Running the first 800 very well, he made&nbsp;a strong move to approach taking the lead coming into the 800, but backed off at the end of the straight, cutting his momentum as he tucked in.&nbsp; He was unable to get it back, finishing in 2:32.02.</p>
            <p align="left">The Mile was next and Aidan Gilson '19 was hoping to get out of his mental funk and get back to being the runner he is.&nbsp; The senior took one giant step forward towards accomplishing that by delivering a 4:12.38 gem.&nbsp; He raced very well with splits of 62.7, 2:06.0 and 3:08.9.&nbsp; He probably took the lead too soon with 360 to go on the turn.&nbsp; With 100 to go he faded a bit as he was passed on the final turn.&nbsp; This&nbsp;was a big boost heading into the championships.&nbsp; Kent Slaney '21 was in a later, slower section, so the concern was that the pace would be too slow.&nbsp; Although it was the 14th section out of 24 ( there had already been 12 sub-4 minute miles in earlier sections), the pace was very fast with the opening 440 in 60.7 for Slaney and he was in fifth place.&nbsp; He ran a great race, moving up as the pace slowed, taking the lead with 400 to go and holding it.&nbsp; He finished strong in a personal best 4:14.86.</p>
            <p align="left">While the distance events had some excellent performances for the men representing MIT,  they were not quite to the standard set by their teammates throughout the weekend.&nbsp; Matthew Kearney '22 was up first for the Engineers.&nbsp; Two weeks prior his 3K had set up perfectly for him to run 8:28.13.&nbsp; This time the section was much more competitive.&nbsp; He was hoping to go through the 1600 in 4:24-4:28.&nbsp; The initial pace did not get out well, which put Kearney in the back in 69 seconds.&nbsp; The pace did pick up, but not enough, and Kearney could not get around those bunched in front of him who were three to four wide.&nbsp; The flow never happened and Kearney never was able to relax and race.&nbsp; Nevertheless he ran a competitive race even though he fell off to 70's at the end, finishing in 8:32.10.&nbsp; Steven Goldy '20 was next and ran exactly has planned, coming through the 1600 in 4:39.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking good with plenty in&nbsp;the tank, Goldy never felt confident with opening up and&nbsp;going after the leaders until the final 150.&nbsp; Although his 8:43.32 was an excellent improvement there is plenty more there.</p>
            <p align="left">The final event was the 5K.&nbsp; Andrew Mah '22, racing the 5K for the second week in a row, hoping to qualify for nationals ran into a similar situation as Kearney in the 3K.&nbsp; The initial pace was slow, and with Mah in the back, he was unable to pass due to the congestion and number of bodies&nbsp;in front of him.&nbsp; This combined with not being fresh mentally had him lose focus about half-way through.&nbsp; His 14:57.79 was far below his ability.&nbsp; In the fourth section, MIT had three runners; Josh Derrick '20, Finn Jacobson-Schulte '21 and Alex Knoedler '18.&nbsp; Derrick went out with the leaders, but was very uncomfortable with how close the runners were.&nbsp; He was not accustomed to having his heels kicked and getting jostled around so he never relaxed, wasting significant energy in the first half of the race. &nbsp;While he slowed slightly during the race from all the fatigue, he ran a strong season best of 15:09.38.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacobson-Schulte and Knoedler worked together early, coming through the 1600 in 4:52, but Knoedler was never relaxed.&nbsp; Knoedler slowed to a 4:55 second 1600 and Jacobson-Schulte a 4:57.&nbsp; Jacobson-Schulte remained at 5:00 pace until the final 200 where he ran a 35&nbsp;for&nbsp;a 15:27.63.&nbsp; He was never fatigued and did not challenge his ability despite the personal best.&nbsp; Knoedler's tense racing got the best of him after 3200 meters, causing him to fade to a 15:34.61.</p>
            <p align="left">Back at MIT, the field event athletes, sprinters and hurdlers and a few oval runners were competing in the <a href="gordonkelly.res.pdf">Gordon Kelly Invitational</a>.&nbsp; The top performance has to go to Jon Fakkema '19 in the Weight Throw.&nbsp; The senior won with a huge&nbsp;personal best of 59-2, number nine on the all-time MIT list and 19th on the current NCAA list.&nbsp; Also in the Weight Throw, Ryan Nall '22 threw 51-0 1/4&nbsp;and Nate Basinger '22 threw 47-2 1/2.</p>
            <p align="left">Joa Kennedy '21 attempted his first Heptathlon and performed amazingly well.&nbsp; With marks of 7.53 in the 60, 20-7 3/4 in the Long Jump, 25-1 1/4 in the Shot Put, 5-11 1/4 in the High Jump, 8.78 in the 60HH, 11-1 3/4 in the Pole Vault and 2:46.98 in the 1000, the sophomore scored 4384 points, ranking him seventh in New England Division III.</p>
            <p align="left">Alex Liu '22 had a big day, running 7.25 in the 60 and 23.59 in the 200, both personal bests.</p>
            <p align="left">For the women&nbsp;Megan Su '22 had a great day, sprinting to&nbsp;an 8.32 personal best and jumping 16-8 1/2 in the Long Jump.&nbsp; Folusho Jebutu '20 did not quite throw a personal best, but she did throw a season best of 48-7 1/4 in the Weight Throw to win the event.</p>
            <p align="left">Next week, MIT will rest many of their athletes in preparation for the New England Division III Championship on February 22-23.&nbsp; Others will travel to Springfield College to get some final qualifying marks or fine tune their performances.            </p>
