Fortunately or unfortunately, neither the men's nor women's meet projected to be a close meet, relieving the coaches of that additional headache.</p>              <p align="left">Similar to 2009, the MIT women have plenty of top level quality, but just do not have the depth to go up against favorably with a very deeply talented team like Williams in a meet with just a couple teams and scoring six scoring places (7-5-4-3-2-1). The larger the meet, the better MIT will tend to do against their peers. For example, after losing this meet last year, MIT turned around and defeated Williams in the championship. </p>              <p align="left">On the reverse side, the men have a very large team and a lot of young top level talent, which last year proved to be too much for the Williams squad. Of course, the Williams men then flipped those results and soundly defeated the Engineers in the championship two weeks later.</p>              <p align="left">The <a href="mittri.res.php">2010 tri meet</a> was a mirror image of 2009. The MIT men won the meet going away, scoring 192.5 to 136.5 for Williams. Coast Guard finished with 47 points. On the women's side, the lop sided match was made worse by some unfortunate injuries and illnesses that appeared in the past two days, leaving the MIT team quite depleted. Williams took advantage, scoring 208 to 132 for MIT and 15 for Coast Guard.</p>              <p align="left">The star of the men's meet was undoubtedly Stephen Morton '10, who won four events, the long jump (22-5 1/4), triple jump (46-3 1/2), 55 dash (6.60) and 200 meter dash (22.49), running season bests in both sprints. For the women, Portia Jones '12, was the star, winning two events, the 55HH (8.26) and 200 (25.67), and placing second in two events, the high jump (5'1) and 400 (57.71). Two of those events, the 55HH and 400, were national qualifying performances and the 200 was a flat track personal best. Her personal battle with Hillary Higgs of Williams brought out the best in both runners. Both sophomores, they squared off in the 400 first. Higgs earned the break and held Jones off around the final turn, although she veered out forcing Jones wide, and held the lead all the way to the line to set a facility record of 57.57. In the 200, Jones won the battle in the home stretch, edging out Higgs. </p>              <p align="left">The best event for the Engineers in both meets was the pole vault. For the women, MIT swept all six scoring places, with Karin Fisher '11, improving her NCAA qualifying mark to 11-10, leading the way. Season and personal bests led the way as Hazel Briner '11 jumped 11-1, Lauren Kuntz '13, cleared 10-7, Becky Stavely '13, vaulted 10-1 1/4, Lynn Jepsen '11, made 10-1 1/4 and Caroline Figgatt '11, successfully cleared 9-1 1/2. For the men, who placed 1-2-3-5-6, Greg Tao '10, led the way with his 14-8 3/4 victory. Nathan Peterson '12, cleared 14-2 3/4 for second, Cyrus Vafadari '12, claimed third, also at 14-2 3/4, Davey Hunt '12, found his magic and vaulted 13-9 and Justin Schmidt '10, closed out the scoring with his 13-3 vault.</p>              <p align="left">The men also dominated the throws, as James Oleinik 'G, showed he is completely back from shoulder surgery as he threw 50-3 1/2 in the shot put, an indoor best to lead a 1-2-4 finish. Tony McDonald '10, threw a personal best of 51-4 1/2 in the weight throw to lead MIT to a 1-3-5 event victory. Other victories on the men's side were all earned on the track and there were quite a few. Kyle Hannon '13, led from start to finish, running 4:18.20 solo. Eric Boyer '13, fought off a poor start in the trials and came back to win the 55HH in a personal best of 8.04. MIT took both relays, winning the 4x400 in 3:26.43 with the quartet of Pat Marx '13, DJ Ronde '13, David Way '13, and John Granata '11. The 4x800 won in 8:06.55 with Dawit Zewdie '13, Logan Trimble '13, Andrew Erickson '12, and Gil O'Neil.</p>              <p align="left">The women dominated the victories in the running events despite holding quite a few people out of the meet. Jacqui Wentz '10, and Brooke Johnson '13, did their weekly 1-2 mile finish, running even better NCAA qualifying performances than the week before with times of 4:59.87 and 5:00.51 respectively. Those times were facility and freshman records respectively.</p>              <p align="left">Another of the track victories was earned by Jamie Simmons '12, in the 600, who led wire to wire in a new personal best of 1:37.03. Johnson came back in the 1000 and after a slow first 400, decided to take matters into her own hands, leading the rest of the way to finish in 3:02.99. Alina Gatowski '11, ran a casual 10:31.40 to win comfortably in the 3000, while Tania Morimoto '12, cruised through a relatively slow 12:09 3200 before running a 5:41 final mile to easily win the 5000 in 18:35.10.</p>              <p align="left">Next week, MIT will split their squad, sending most of their oval runners to Boston University to compete in the Valentine's Invitational while leaving their short sprinters, hurdlers and all field events at home for the MIT Coed Invite II. This will be the final tuneup prior to the championships where the women will hope to defend their title and the men will hope to improve on their second place finish in 2009. </p>              <p align="center"><a href="../itfsched.php">RETURN TO INDOOR</a>  </p>              <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>          </div>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>      </table></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
