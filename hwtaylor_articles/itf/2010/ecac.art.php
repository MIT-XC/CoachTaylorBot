MIT qualified about 30 men and 20 women for the championship, but elected to only take those individuals either already qualified for nationals or right on the cusp of doing so. Those qualified, but not competing are getting ready for the already short outdoor season.</p>              <p align="left">The pole vaulters took advantage of the opportunity, improving the qualifying marks for two vaulters. Hazel Briner '11, cleared 12-3 1/2 for a new personal best to earn second place. Although she did not clear a PR, Karin Fisher '11, vaulted well, placing third with 11-11 3/4. For the men, Greg Tao '10, cleared a new personal best of 16-01 3/4 to earn second place. All three vaulters should make the NCAA Championship field being announced on Monday.</p>              <p align="left">In the 55HH, Portia Jones '12, qualified for the finals by running 8.38 on Friday. In the finals, she tweaked her glute in her warmup as she tripped on one of the hurdles, and placed fourth in 8.40.</p>              <p align="left">Martha Gross '12, ran the 400, trying to qualify for nationals. She ran a flat track personal best of 59.10 to place third. She lost some momentum on the third turn when the pace slowed and she did not react fast enough by moving into lane two, but instead had to brake for a stride before moving out.</p>              <p align="left">Stephen Morton '10, competed in the triple jump and long jump, but was only going to jump in the trials so that his legs stayed fresh for next week. In the triple he jumped 46-4 1/4 to place third. In the long jump, Morton had two big fouls, only getting his third jump in, well behind the board, for 22-0 1/2. </p>              <p align="left">Brooke Johnson '13, and Jamie Simmons '12, raced in the 800, Johnson to get in something a little shorter than the mile for a last minute tune-up and Simmons to get more familiar with the race so she is that much better prepared for the distance medley relay at nationals. Both were in the slow section due to the fact neither has run the 800 more than once, entering times of 2:21 and 2:22. Johnson took the pace out, as prescribed, in 33 high. Simmons did not take over right away, letting the pace slip to 68 for the 400. Johnson, realizing that Simmons was not going to push the pace, took control with 350 to go, pulling away from the field and finishing, looking very strong in 2:18.51, a new MIT freshman record and sixth place overall out of the three sections. Simmons closed well, finishing in 2:18.87 to finish in eighth overall.</p>              <p align="left">Kyle Hannon '13, raced the mile at the <a href="http://scripts.mit.edu/%7Ehwtaylor/itf/09-10/ic4a.res.php">IC4A Championship</a> being held at Boston University. The IC4As are the oldest track and field conference in the country, a men's only conference made up of division I, II and III teams from the entire east, reaching all the way to Indiana. Hoping to improve on his 4:12.18 and thus move up on the national rankings list, Hannon managed a 4:11.67 for yet another MIT freshman record.</p>              <p align="left">Next week, MIT leaves for the NCAA Division III Championship being held at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. The women are ranked second and the men 11th.</p>              <p align="center"><a href="../itfsched.php">RETURN TO INDOOR</a> </p>              <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>          </div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>      </table></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
