In addition, the men's team from Springfield College joined the action. </p>              <p align="left">MIT's men's team has won this meet each of the past five years, and based on the pre-meet seeds the sixth year would be no different. The women lost their meet last year (finishing second to Bowdoin) despite winning the New England Division III championship three weeks later. The reason for last year's loss and this year's concern was the lack of depth against teams with much larger numbers. The Tech women have more team members this year, but still not enough to be called a deep team. </p>              <p align="left">The Engineers, competing away from their home track for the first time this year, took advantage of the fast track and excellent competition to post five new NCAA Division III Championship provisional marks, narrowly missing three others en route to  resounding victories. The men scored 264 points to Springfield's 108, Bowdoin's 92, Tufts' 74 and Colby's 14. The women, pulling their 4x800 team as well as a couple national level performers who were feeling injuries coming on, prevailed by a score of 210.5 to Bowdoin's 159, Tufts' 112.5, and Colby's 90.</p>              <p align="left">For the women, Alina Gatowski '11, got things rolling for MIT in the 5000 by running uncontested 85-86 second quarters until closing with a 2:02 final 600 to win going away in 17:42.85, missing an NCAA provisional mark by .85 seconds. Also running well was Maggie Lloyd '12, missing a personal best by less than a second with a 18:37.88. Sarah Sprague '13, and Lauren Allen '13, also ran personal bests with times of 19:00.52 and 19:04.74 to place fifth and sixth respectively, earning three points in the 10-8-6-4-2-1 scoring format.</p>              <p align="left">As as come to be expected, MIT women won nine of the 12 running events they entered. However, as as also come to be expected they did not fair well in the field events, particularly the horizontal jumps and throws, winning only the vertical events, the pole vault and high jump. In the running events, the mile was the next event after the 5K, and Jacqui Wentz '10, Brooke Johnson '13 and Missy Shower '13, dominated with a 1-2-3 finish. Wentz and Johnson provisionally qualified for nationals with times of 5:02.34 and 5:04.07 respectively.</p>              <p align="left">Next up was the 55HH, where despite All American, Amy Magnuson '10, not competing, MIT held their own. Portia Jones '12, won with a 8.46. She was supported by a third place finish from the very versatile Hazel Briner '11, in 9.00.</p>              <p align="left">Jones, the eighth place finisher at last year's nationals, turned right around to run the 400 where teammate Jamie Simmons '12, had won the first section in a very fast 59.34. Jones did not get the break coming out of the second turn and was unable to pass Elsa Millett from Bowdoin. However, Simmons' time held up to win the event with Jones claiming third in 59.69. The night before at Boston University's Terrier Classis, Jones had run 58.01 in the 400 and Simmons ran 2:22.26 in her first ever 800. </p>              <p align="left">The 600 was up next and Martha Gross '12, moved up in distance to show her skills beyond the 400, winning in 1:39.66 with Kirsten Aarsvold '11, placing fourth in 1:41.83.</p>              <p align="left">In the 800, Wentz and Johnson were back on the track and the results was the same as in the mile, a 1-2 finish. Wentz ran 34 for each of the four 200s to win in 2:16.86, narrowly missing qualifying for the NCAA Championships. Johnson ran 2:21.78 for second. </p>              <p align="left">Jones came back in the 200, this time defeating Millett, 26.35 to 26.45, despite running out of lane two. Simmons, racing out of the disadvantageous lane one, placed fifth in 27.35.</p>              <p align="left">In the 3000, Tania Morimoto '12, ran consistent 41 second 200 splits to place first in a fine time of 10:23.89.</p>              <p align="left">The final running event victory came from the 4x400 relay, which ran 4:06.90 with excellent legs from Simmons (59.9), Gross (62.0), Aarsvold (63.2) and Briner (61.5).</p>              <p align="left">In the field events, Jones jumped to a school record tying mark of 5-1 3/4 for first place. She was supported by Briner in third and Diana Zhu '13, in fifth. Briner, scoring 25.5 points for MIT, tied with Karin Fisher '11, in the pole vault as both jumped NCAA qualifying marks and personal bests of 11-8.</p>              <p align="left">The men, displayed both quality and depth in their victory. The Engineers won eight of the 12 running events and three of the six field events, as well as claiming second in nine of the 16 individual events.</p>              <p align="left">The first final on the track was the mile. Bill Phipps '10, led nearly the entire race, pushing the pace when everyone else was only interested in the final 400. Running a 60 second final 400, Kyle Hannon '13, jumped the field to win in 4:17.09, just missing an NCAA qualifying mark. Ben Mattocks '12, ran a personal best of 4:24.82 for fourth and Phipps hung on for sixth in 4:25.18.</p>              <p align="left">While Tech did not win the next final, the 55HH, it is worth noting that freshman Eric Boyer, competing for the first time this year due to an earlier hip flexor injury, led MIT to a 2-3-4-5 display of depth with a 8.09 time. Brian Djaja '13, Nick Leonard '11, and Drew Musacchio claimed the other places respectively.</p>              <p align="left">In the 600, John Granata '11, who took the pace out way too fast with a 25 second first 200, nevertheless held on for a 1:23.68 second place, falling only to teammate Pat Marx '13, in 1:23.28, who ran a near perfectly paced race.</p>              <p align="left">MIT took another 1-2 finish in the 800 as fellow freshmen, David Way and Gil O'Neil ran 1:58.89 and 1:59.22. The other 800 runners were in the 1000, the next event. Although they did not win, their times were fantastic as Stephen Serene '12, Hannon and Logan Trimble placed 2-3-5 with times of 2:33.97, 2:34.39 and 2:34.91 respectively.</p>              <p align="left">Stephen Morton '10, a busy guy on this day, won the 200 in 22.80 for a season best performance. Josh Duncavage '13, claimed third in 23.43.</p>              <p align="left">The MIT distance runners claimed victories in both the 3000 and 5000 meter events. In the 3000, Hemu Arumugam '10, held off a furious kick to win in 8:39.58. He was supported by Paul Welle '11, who ran a season best of 8:48.03. In the 5000, an ailing Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, ran all alone out front to win in 15:41.43. Matt Weaver '12, ran a PR for the second week in a row, running 16:09.90 for fourth place.</p>              <p align="left">The relays provided the most exciting races of the day as MIT and Springfield did battle in both, with both coming down to the wire to be settled by less than .2 of a second. In the 4x400, DJ Ronde '13, led off, giving MIT the lead with a 52.3 split. Marx lost the lead, but handed off even, running an excellent 50.7 leg. Way, was unable to pass the Springfield runner, but nearly pulled even, although the handoff to Granata put MIT behind despite his 51.6 split. Granata went out hard to stay up with the fine anchor from Springfield, but waited until the final straight to make his move. Finally taking the lead with 10 meters to go, Granata ran 49.8 to give MIT the victory in 3:24.61. The 4x800 was no less exciting. O'Neil started out well, but faded in the last 200, running 2:02.6 to drop MIT behind. Trimble ran an excellent 1:59.8 leg to take the lead at the handoff. Dawit Zewdie '13, did not run his fastest leg, but put MIT in the lead with his 2:02.3 leg. Serene held onto the lead, running a very courageous final 200 against the hard charging Springfield anchor, to close in 2:00.5 for a cumulative time of 8:05.37.</p>              <p align="left">The Tech throwers, owned their events, claiming 1-2-3 in both the weight throw and the shot put. In the 35lb. weight, freshman Ken Cooper approached the prestigious MIT freshman record of 52-10 with his winning heave of 51-5 3/4. Close behind, CK Umachi, throwing despite a deep thigh bruise from getting hit by the weight earlier in the week, tossed a PR of 51-5 1/2 for second. Tony McDonald '10, threw 49-10 for third. In the shot put, James Oleinik 'G, won the event even though he only threw 47-2 1/4. Mitch Kelley '11, put the shot 46-1 1/4 for second. McDonald again claimed third in 45-3.</p>              <p align="left">The final victory for MIT was in the triple jump where Morton jumped 46-8 1/4 on only two jumps. Mattias Flander '11, showed he is getting close to championship form with his 44-5 1/2 third place jump.</p>              <p align="left">Even though they did not win the events, MIT competed well in the both the long jump and pole vault. In the vault, All America Greg Tao '10, competed for the first time since before the holidays. While he was not in championship form, he did clear 14-5 1/4 for third place behind teammate Nathan Peterson '12, also at 14-5 1/4, and Trent Wiseman of Colby, who had a career day, clearing 15-3 to win. Morton jumped a season best and NCAA provisional qualifying mark of 23-0 in the long jump but could not overtake Kevin Coyle of Springfield who jumped 23-7 1/4. Rene Peters '13, and Flander jumped season bests with leaps of 21-2 3/4 and 21-1 1/2 for fourth and fifth respectively.</p>              <p align="left">Next week, MIT hosts rival Williams College and the Coast Guard Academy, starting Saturday at noon.</p>              <p align="center"><a href="../itfsched.php">RETURN TO INDOOR</a>  </p>          </div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;</td>        </tr>      </table></td>  </tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
