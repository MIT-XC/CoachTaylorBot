              <p align="left">February 27-28, 2015</p>
              <p align="left">MIT rested most of their distance athletes going into the <a href="neciaaa.res.php">NEICAAA Championship</a> at Boston University, but the athletes they did bring showed the mostly Division I competition that in many cases Division III is as strong if not better. </p>
              <p align="left">On day one, the women's DMR got things moving with a resounding win in a come-from-behind victory with Maryann Gong '17 as the anchor. Christina Wicker '17 started things off with the 1200 leg. She initially went after the leader, but when her 33 first 200 dropped her behind and her 68 dropped her farther behind, she decided to race those in the chase pack. This she did well until the the final 400, where after a 2:20 800 split she fell to a 3:35.9, still an excellent finish. This put Tech pretty far behind and in fourth place. Hannah Chen '18, who had already run an open 400 in a disappointing 58.21, came back well, catching Tufts and handing off in third in 57.7. Cindy Huang '15 went out too hard (31.1), but still made up ground on the chase group as she pulled almost even with Middlebury at the handoff in 2:17.4. Gong immediately went to second place as she calmly started off with a 34 first 200. As she split a 69, she realized she was not making up any ground on first place, who was at least eight seconds ahead, and seemed to lose a little passion. However, the leader was obviously feeling her own 69 and once Gong learned of this she was reinvigorated. Slowing down for Gong is still a 73 400. After two of these she had closed to within thirty meters and had 400 remaining. She blasted a 70 to take the lead and run away with the title in 11:36.78, the fastest time in Division III this year. Her individual split was an impressive 4:45.6.</p>
              <p align="left">In the Pole Vault, Cimmy Virdi '16 cleared an indoor personal best of 13-1 1/2, placing third and maintaining a tie for the top spot in Division III. Abby Klein '15 finally hit her goal, clearing 12-1 1/2 to place sixth and move up to a five-way tie for 10th on the NCAA list.</p>
              <p align="left">Ellen Liverpool '15 missed winning the Weight Throw by two centimeters, but was seeded third so she certainly improved on her seed. Her second place throw was a personal best of 55-6 1/4 to move up to a tie for ninth in the National ranking. Jackie Vahey '17 threw 51-1 for her own personal best, finishing ninth in the competition.</p>
              <p align="left">Kendra Knittel '17 raced the 200, but came out high in the start, nearly ran into the inside lane and lost focus from there. She ran 26.02, a respectable time given her start.</p>
              <p align="left">Veronica Szklarzewski '15 ran 8.02 in the 60, a reasonable time given the soft surface of the sprint lanes. In the Long Jump she did not have the amazing jumps that netted her the MIT record last week, settling for 16-10 1/4.</p>
              <p align="left">For the men, States Lee '16 had the performance of the day, running a new MIT record of 48.28 as he made the finals with the third fastest time of the day. Derek Barnes '16 ran 49.34 in his heat.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 200, Tre Albritten '18 showed his sprint skills as he ran 22.00 out of lane five, setting a new freshman record. Luca Cacopardo '18 ran a tremendous 200 out of lane three even though he felt a tug on his hamstring. His time was 22.29. Michael Kaba '16 ran 22.36 as he is recovering from the weight loss due to a recent illness.</p>
              <p align="left">In the field events Ben Schreck '15, coming back from a nagging hamstring injury cleared 15-9 to place second, just missing 16-1 and a shot at Nationals. Ken Cooper '15 did not have his best day, but he did place seventh with a 56-2 effort in the Weight Throw.</p>
              <p align="left">Dan Kilcoyne '16, despite missing key practices the past two weeks with an illness, qualified for finals in the 1000 with a 2:31.75.</p>
              <p align="left">Sam Parker '15 and Rick Paez '15 raced the 800 trials. Parker uncharacteristically took over the lead 100 meters into the race. He held the lead through a 55.8 400 and then lost the lead on the backstretch, not responding to the change in pace and finishing in 1:54.73. Paez was in a different heat. He panicked over his position and the slow initial pace, moved towards the front and proceeded to react to every move, exhausting himself by 500 meters. Although he ran 54.3 at the 400, he struggled home in 1:58.08.</p>
              <p align="left">At the end of day one, MIT women were in first place with 27 points while the men were in sixth with 10 points.</p>
              <p align="left">Starting off day two the field events got the women scoring right off the bat. Isabella Stuopis '16 threw a season best 43-6 to place fourth in the Shot Put. At the same time, Michelle Johnson '15 set an MIT record of 37-6 1/2 to get into finals and place eighth. Neither mark is quite enough to make it to the NCAA's, but they have one more opportunity next week.</p>
              <p align="left">Maryann Gong was back on the track as the number one seed in the Mile. Through the first half she was biding her time through splits of 73 and 2:29. As the pace was deteriorating, Gong took off, immediately pushing the pace to 70 seconds per quarter. Absolutely no response was given by her opponents as she powered to the win in 4:49.61, a new MIT record and the 10th fastest time in DIII history.</p>
              <p align="left">In the High Jump Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 and Natalie Alper '17 were unable to duplicate their magic from last weekend. Dealing with the soft jumping surface helped neither athlete as Vaidyanathan made 5-3, the opening height, which Alper failed to clear.</p>
              <p align="left">Christina Wicker came back in the 3K to see if she could improve her NCAA performance to put the Engineers in a position to score more points at Nationals. However, she fell out of competitiveness after 800 meters finishing with a 10:18.06.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event for the women was the 4x400 Relay. Kayla Harris '15 led off with a 59.0 that would have probably been a bit better had it not been for getting bumped going into the final turn. Annie Dai '18 ran a strong 59.9 and Sam Fierro '18 ran 60.5. Hannah Chen, despite a very poor handoff ran 57.3 to give MIT a 3:56.81 season best.</p>
              <p align="left">The women totaled 43 points to finish in eighth place overall and the first Division III team.</p>
              <p align="left">The men started off day two with the Mile Run. Colin Godwin '17 ran a very competitive race, splitting 64, 2:06 and 3:09 before finishing strong in 4:11.15 to place seventh. There was hesitation on his part that kept him from moving with three laps to go that probably would have given him the time he needed to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship. Nick O'Connell raced when he probably should not have given his cold, and it showed as he faded at the end, finishing in 4:22.56</p>
              <p align="left">Next up was States Lee in the 400. Racing in the slow section of the two section final, Lee ran a nearly perfect race, splitting 22.6 en route to yet another MIT record of 48.16 in winning his section. The fast section was not so fast as only one individual beat Lee's time, earning him second place.</p>
              <p align="left">Ken Cooper  had a great day in the Shot Put and his best mark of the season. He was leading until the end of the competition when he was passed by one thrower, giving him second place at 55-1.</p>
              <p align="left">Dan Kilcoyne also ran a near flawless race, moving up well in the field and managing to have a pretty good kick as he finished sixth in 2:29.74.</p>
              <p align="left">The Triple Jump did not bring such great results as none of the MIT jumpers produced their best. Arinze Okeke '17 jumped 45-1 1/2, Carrington Motley '16 finished with a 44-9 3/4 effort and Billy Ruschel '18 managed 44-3 1/2.</p>
              <p align="left">Matt Deyo '16 was hoping for a fast pace in the 3K, but that was not to be. Ideally the leaders would be running 66-67 pace per quarter, but instead the pace was pedestrian, hitting the 1600 in 4:35. The pace did not pick up until 600 meters to go. Deyo is more of a distance runner, coming down in distance for this race, and was only able to finish in 1:34 for a new personal best of 8:26.56, garnering fifth place.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event was the 4x400. Replacing Cacopardo with Parker due to the former's hamstring problem, MIT was hoping to improve on their 3:16.12 from earlier in the season. Lee led off, doing a magnificent job of handling the break and cut-in, which was full of contact. Lee came out unscathed for the most part although the contact certainly slowed him down. Nevertheless he handed off in second in 48.4. Barnes took the baton and passed on the first backstretch to take the lead. On the second lap he was passed, falling into a tie for second at the handoff to Sam Parker in 49.0. Parker was torched in the first lap, fading to a distant fourth, but what the 800 runner lacks in pure speed he made up for in endurance as he moved into third and very close to second at the handoff in 49.5. Michael Kaba stayed close throughout his leg, and never allowed the teams behind to pass. His 48.3 brought MIT a third place in 3:15.20, the fastest time this season and the fifth fastest time in Division III. The men totaled 41 points, good for fifth place overall.</p>
              <p align="left">Next weekend is the final opportunity to qualify for Nationals. Some MIT men will compete at the IC4A Championship at Boston University on Saturday while the women and the other men will compete at the Tufts Last Chance Qualifier held on Friday.</p>
