<P>February 20, 1999</P>

<P>For the third year in a row, MIT finished second in the Indoor New
England Division III Championships. Relying on many high places in
many events, but no individual champions, MIT managed to distance
themselves from 3rd place Wheaton College, but could not catch the
equally diverse and slightly more talented Williams College team.</P>

<P>Going into the meet, MIT was seeded to score 74 points to
Wheaton's 72, and Williams' 83. However, MIT was nursing a lot of
injuries that would ultimately prove to be the biggest enemy. Team
co-captain Ravi Sastry, seeded 2nd in the Pentathlon, and High
Hurdles, and 5th in the Long Jump, was hurting from both a bad back
and a previously torn hamstring. Sam Thibault, seeded 3rd in the Pole
Vault was hoping his ankle would allow him to run full speed. Kalpak
Kothari, seeded 6th in the Triple Jump, has a mysterious ankle
problem that hurts whenever he jumps. Jordan Alperin, seeded 4th in
the Pentathlon and entered in the High Jump, had not been at practice
all week due to a bout with the flu. Finally, Sean Montgomery, seeded
2nd in the 1500 and 5th in the 800, as well as anchor in the 1600
Relay, was going to try to run with a broken big toe.</P>

<P>The Pentathlon was scheduled to be the first event, and only event
on Friday. MIT had 4 of the 12 qualifiers and was seeded to score 13
points. The first event, the High Hurdles went well for MIT, leaving
the Sastry in first, Alperin in 2nd, Peter Bluvas in 3rd, and Roger
Nielsen in 6th. After the next event, which is the Long Jump, Tech
still had a hold on 1st, 2nd, and 4th. The Shot Put allowed Bluvas to
move from 4th to 1st as he threw a PR of 42-2 3/4. Sastry moved down
to 2nd, and Alperin remained in 4th. The High Jump, usually very kind
to MIT in the Pentathlon, allowed the eventual winner from Trinity
College to move into 1st place with a 6-7 jump. Ravi's back did not
allow him to jump higher than 5-10 1/2, pushing him to 3rd. MIT still
had 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, with Nielsen having moved up to 5th. However,
with Sastry nursing his hamstring most of the year, Alperin out with
the flu, and Nielsen working off an injured ankle from early in the
season, the distance training had been a little less than prescribed.
The 1000 was going to be a nail biter. The Tech multi-eventers came
through, holding onto 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. Nielsen slipped to 7th, just
21 points out of scoring. The 18 point lead seemed like a great
start.</P>

<P>Day 2 began with the trials in all running events from the 600 -
down. Ravi rebounded from his pentathlon to make it into the hurdles
finals. Robbie Gray, seeded 9th, made it through the first round of
the dash, but could not advance to the finals. Todd Rosenfield,
seeded 11th in the 400, got the break but died in the final 100 to
just miss advancing in the 400. Neal Karchem, seeded 8th in the 600,
ran a PR of 1:25.33 to make into the finals.</P>

<P>Over in the field events, Ravi staked claim to 1st place in the
Long Jump coming out of the trials with a PR of 22-3 1/2, finally
making the indoor top 10 list. However, in the last two rounds, two
jumpers passed him to push him to 3rd, still 2 places higher than he
was seeded.</P>

<P>Not to be outdone in the horizontal jumps, Kalpak sucked up the
pain in his ankle and jumped into the lead on his final jump with a
PR of 44-6 1/2 only to have the previous leader pass him back to win
the event. Going from 6th seed to finish 2nd was certainly going to
help MIT.</P>

<P>Sean Montgomery was ready to test out his toe in the 1500 as the
finals of the running events were getting underway. Sean started off
okay, but it was apparent that he was not running with his usual
fluid stride. At the half it was obvious that Sean was struggling.
Finishing in the back of the pack, it was obvious that using a
different stride pattern was involving different muscles that could
not handle what was being asked of them.</P>

<P>Ravi was up next in the High Hurdles and had a great race. He
started well out of the blocks, was with the leaders early, then
pulled away slightly going into the 5th hurdle. Ravi clipped the 5th
hurdle and came down a little off balance, which was enough to allow
the top seeded Middlebury hurdler to edge him out at the line. Ravi
ran a personal best of 7.85 to complete his fantastic weekend and 20
point contribution.</P>

<P>The Pole Vault and High Jump were getting under way at this time.
The Vault was opening at 12-6, which was sure to trim the field
quickly. MIT's three entries all cleared opening height and 13-0 as
well. Sam Sidiqi, clearing 13-0 on his first effort, was in sole
possession of 4th place but could not make 13-6. Matt Potts, who
needed 3 attempts to make 13-0, was just out of the money, finishing
7th. Sam Thibault made 13-6 and finished 2nd to give MIT a total of
12 points. Jordan Alperin was able to shake off the effects of his
flu for yet another day, and the pentathlon from the day before, to
clear both 5-11, and 6-1 on his first attempts. Even though Jordan
made 2 good attempts at 6-3, he could not clear it. His effort earned
him a 3 way tie for 5th, good enough for 1 point.</P>

<P>Neal was up next in the 600 final. Although he was guaranteed a
point just for finishing, Neal was not satisfied with just placing
higher than he was seeded. Coming through the 400 in 54.7, Neal moved
into 4th place and would not give it up, running a PR of 1:24.92 and
securing 4 points for MIT.</P>

<P>Sean was up again in the 800 to give his toe another try. He
seemed to have fixed his stride problem, but had apparently lost some
confidence. He immediately settled into the middle of the pack rather
than his customary place among the leaders. Nevertheless, Sean came
through the 600 in 1:26 and was in position to do something in the
race. However, the confidence was not there, and the toe did not
cooperate, giving Sean a 1:58.85 for his efforts, which were way
above the call of duty.</P>

<P>In the 1000, Leif went with leaders in an attempt to win the race.
Running even splits of 30. seconds up through the 800, it looked as
though Leif would pull it off. However, he was not quite able to reel
in the leaders, finishing 4 tenths out of first for a third place
finish and PR of 2:31.39.</P>

<P>Going into the 3000, Wheaton College was leading with 66 points,
but there only scoring potential remaining was in the 1600 Relay.
Williams was 1/2 point ahead of MIT, 63.5 to 63, with both schools
having equal opportunity in the distances, but Williams had the edge
in the relays. Going by the seeds, Williams was expected to garner 40
points in the remaining events, with MIT securing 29, and Wheaton
scoring 10.</P>

<P>The race was tight through 2600 meters for the leaders, which
included Mike Parkins and Mark Strauss. Robert Mitchell of Amherst,
the winner in the 1500, was able to pull away at the end to win in
8:30.74. Parkins held on to run a PR of 8:33. 72 and finish 3rd. Mark
faded in the last 200, but still placed 6th with a 8:38.94. Williams
was not up by 5 1/2 after having placed 2nd and 4th. MIT was now in
2nd place, ahead of Wheaton.</P>

<P>Dan Feldman was seeded 1st in the 5000, but had already begun to
feel the effects of the flu, which was beginning to invade his
system. This combined with wasting too much energy competing for
position in the first mile took their toll on Dan. He soon lost
contact with the two leaders, one of who was a Williams' runner, but
he was able to maintain a strong hold on 3rd place. Chris McGuire,
who had fallen off the pace early, was in a solid 4th position and
moving up. Chris moved past Dan with 400 meters to go and finished in
3rd with a season best of 15:16.04. Dan was well off his best, but
under the conditions competed well to finish in 4th with a 15:21.33.
Williams and MIT both scored 10 points in the event, so no ground was
gained.</P>

<P>The DMR was next, and in an effort to score a point or two, Mark
Strauss and Mike Parkins were coming back from the 3000 with only 25
minutes recovery to run the 1200 and 1600 legs respectively. Mark led
off and was not able to put together a solid time, leaving MIT in
11th position with a 3:21 1200. Ashley Clayborne ran the 400 and
moved MIT up 1 place with a 53.7 clocking. Ray Molnar ran a personal
best of 2:03.1 in the 800 to move MIT into 9th place. Parkins took
over virtually with no chance to score as the leaders were about 20
seconds ahead. Nevertheless, Mike put his head down and gave it an
effort, running a 4:29 mile to bring MIT into 7th, one place out of
scoring. Williams finished 3rd in the event, moving them 11 1/2
points ahead of MIT. Short of dropping a baton, it seemed to be
over.</P>

<P>The 1600 Relay for MIT, originally seeded 5th, was almost a lost
cause due to the loss of leadoff man, Yuval Mazor, out with a stress
fracture, and Sean being hindered with his broken toe. Robbie Gray,
Neal Karchem, Todd Rosenfield, and Sean put together a 3:31.86
effort, but were no where near scoring. Williams finished 2nd to put
the meet out of reach. Top seeded Wheaton only managed a 5th place,
which gave MIT 2nd place in the meet.</P>

<P>The final event, the 3200 Relay, had MIT seeded 3rd. The leadoff
runner was rookie, Damian Plummer. Damian ran a very strong race,
died at the end, but ran a personal best of 2:03.8 to start things
off. Phil Loiselle, put together a well run 1:59.9 effort to put MIT
in 3rd position. Another rookie, Alan Raphael, moved up from the 400
and ran a superb 2:01.5 to give MIT some breathing room from 4th
place Williams. Leif anchored, moving quickly up to within 5 meters
of 2nd place Brandeis, who was being anchored by defending outdoor
national 800 champion, Geoff Getz. Getz then pulled away, leaving
Leif to hold onto the predicted 3rd place with a cumulative time of
8:03.43.</P>

<P>Overall, MIT had a superb outing, and a very competitive effort,
particularly from those team leaders who were not in the best of
health. Next week a handful of Engineers will compete at the All New
England Championship at Boston University against the Division I
colleges in New England.</P>
