<P>JANUARY 23, 1999</P>

<P>The Men's Track and Field Team traveled to Brunswick, Maine this
past Saturday where Bowdoin College was hosting one of the 2nd Quad
Cup Meets of the season. Behind early, the Engineers made their
typical strong comeback by winning every event from the 800 Meters
up, and both relays, to win the meet over Tufts, Bates, Colby, and
Bowdoin by the respective scores of 189 to 155.45, to 107.5, to 75,
to 73 respectively.</P>

<P>Even though this league with the New England Division III
Conference is called the Quad Cup Series, the meets do not
necessarily have 4 teams involved. Due to the number of teams
involved, the number of sites available, and those schools who have
one coach coaching both men and women, thus preferring coed meets,
the scheduling does not always render a perfect quad meet. In this
particular case, there were five teams involved.</P>

<P>One of the quirks of the schedule is, in an effort to see all of
the teams in a four week schedule, there are sometimes competitions
where teams see each other for a 2nd or 3rd time. After beating Tufts
last week by nearly 100 points, MIT had a difficult time getting
psyched up for a meet where Tufts was once again expected to be the
next best team. Coach Halston Taylor warned the tracksters that Tufts
would be greatly improved and wanting to exact some payback for the
previous week's defeat. Bates was known to have some strong talent,
but not quite enough depth to win in a meet that scores 8 places per
event. Likewise, Colby and Bowdoin have some particular strengths,
but not enough to be a contender for the victory. However, what can
and did happen is that the easy points that might be available when
there are 3 teams are picked up by someone else when there are 5
teams involved.</P>

<P>MIT started the meet with high hopes since Ravi Sastry '98, was
attempting a comeback from his early season hamstring injury.
However, in the first event, the Triple Jump, Robbie Gray '02, took
one jump and announced he was done due to his hamstring. Robbie is
the teams 2nd best sprinter and triple jumper. Consequently, Tech
only scored 3rd and 8th in the Triple as Kalpak Kothari '01, and
Chris Kelly '02, survived the Tufts onslaught that saw them go from
2nd and 3rd to 1st and 2nd in the final round.</P>

<P>Likewise, in the Weight Throw, Jason Dailey '99, went from 5th to
7th in the finals. After the first two events, Tufts was ahead 22-10.
As the field events continued, MIT did not get their expected points
due to depth. Tech was blanked in the Shot Put while Tufts garnered 7
more points. Sastry came through big in the Long Jump with a 21-5
victory, but that was the only score for the Techmen. Meanwhile,
Tufts 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 8th for 17 points, and 46-19 lead.</P>

<P>The vertical jumps started to turn things around for Tech. Jordan
Alperin '02, won the High Jump with a 6-2 effort, and Sastry and Sam
Sidiqi '99, gathered a 5th and 8th to Tufts 2nd, 6th, and 7th. In the
Pole Vault, Tech's known strength was not evident as Bates and
Bowdoin challenged. Matt Potts '00, one of five vaulters to clear
13', won on fewer misses. Sam Thibault '00, was one of the other, but
he received 5th. Tufts did not score in the Pole Vault to give MIT a
deficit of 58-47 after the field events.</P>

<P>Sastry elected to pass on the 55 Dash in order to protect his
hamstring, so without him and Gray, MIT was blanked in a 2nd event.
Unfortunately, Tufts scored 17 points to make things very
uncomfortable for Tech.</P>

<P>Sastry's move paid off in the hurdles, as he, Alperin, and Peter
Bluvas '01, took 1st, 4th, and 6th to start the comeback. Once again,
MIT was needing the strength of the 400 and up, and once again the
athletes in those events responded. </P>

<P>Todd Rosenfield '01, and Yuval Mazor '02, ran poor strategic
races, but nevertheless placed 5th and 6th against very strong
competition in the 400. In the 600, Neal Karchem '99, placed 2nd with
a personal best of 1:27.20. He was followed by Ashley Clayborne '99,
in 4th and Alan Raphael '02, in 6th. In these two events, Tufts
scored only 12 points to MIT's 22.</P>

<P>In the 800 and 1000, MIT outscored Tufts 44 to 26 thanks in large
part to the strong efforts from the distance runners. Sean Montgomery
'01, led the way in the 800. While Leif Seed '99, did the same in the
1000. Mike Parkins' 99, finished strong in the 800 to edge two Tufts
runners for 2nd place. John Biesiadecki '01, and Ken Walker '01,
followed suit in 5th and 6th place, edging out a Tufts runner who
claimed 7th. In the 1000, Phil Loiselle '01, and Chris McGuire '00,
fell off Leif's place a bit, but still claimed 3rd, and 4th. Matt
Yarosz '02, scored his first varsity point with an 8th place
effort.</P>

<P>The Mile Run, Tech's best event, fell victim to an inability to
carry out the game plan. Instead of running a strong pace and kicking
with 600 to go, the Engineers started with a pedestrian 68 for the
first 400, and duplicated that lack of effort on the 2nd 400. This
set up the trailing Tufts and Bowdoin runners to possibly steal the
race. Fortunately, Tech's talent was a little too much, as they
garnered 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 7th places.</P>

<P>Going into the last 3 events, the 5000 and the two relays, MIT was
only up by 11 1/2 points. Due to the depth of middle distance and
distance runners on MIT's squad, they were able to have four fresh
bodies available for what promised to be a very fast 5000. Freshman
Dan Feldman, possibly a bit over anxious after waiting around all day
to run, took the lead right from the start. Dan went out in 70 second
400s all the way through a 4:41 first mile. Mark Strauss '01, was
right behind Dan as was a very good Bates runner. The crowd kept
expecting Dan to self destruct, but with the MIT cheering him on, Dan
continued his torrid pace, slowing modestly to a 9:28 2 mile split.
On his own now, Dan slowed to 73 seconds per quarter, but finished
strong with a 33 second last 200 to win in a nationally qualifying
time of 14:54.27. A time which blows away the previous freshman mark
of 15:10.41 by teammate Chris McGuire. Also running personal bests
for MIT were Mark Strauss '01, getting 3rd in 15:04.36, Liyan Guo
'01, running to a 7th place finish with a 15:44.3 effort, and Ed
Keehr '01, coming back strong for a 15:45.6 8th place finish. This
give Tech 6 runners under 15:46 this season.</P>

<P>Tech's relay teams were as loaded as possible given the fatigue
factor that comes with a 3 hour meet. In the 1600 Relay, MIT led off
with a strong leg from Rosenfield, who nevertheless found himself in
3rd place at the handoff, behind Tufts and Colby. Mazor ran a 51.8
leg to open up a 5 meter lead as he handed off to a tired Karchem.
Neal held his ground and gave Montgomery a 1 meter lead. The problem
was that the 1 meter lead was against the defending New England
Division III Champion in the 400. Sean gave up the lead coming down
the homestretch the first time, but never lost contact. Coming down
the final homestretch, Sean opened it up and passed the Colby runner
for 3:26.82 victory.</P>

<P>The final event, the 3200 Relay was not a dramatic, but close
nevertheless. Biesiadecki opened up with a modest 2:05 to put MIT
down by a few meters. Parkins quickly made up that difference and
gave Loiselle a lead with a 2:02. Phil held on to the lead and ran an
outstanding 2:01 to give Seed a 10 meter lead at the handoff. Seed
did nothing to hurt that lead, running a strong 2:00 to give Tech the
victory with a 8:10.28 to Tufts 8:12.79.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT puts its undefeated season on the line, at home,
against Williams, Bates, and WPI.</P>
