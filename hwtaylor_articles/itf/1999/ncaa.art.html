<P>&nbsp;</P></CENTER>

<P>March 12, 1999</P>

<P>Ada, Ohio</P>

<P>MIT's sole representative at the NCAA Division III Championships
was Mark Strauss '01, racing in the 5000 meters. Four other runners
on the Men's team had qualified provisionally, but none were selected
to round out the 11-13 man fields.</P>

<P>Mark's run was scheduled for 7:05 on Friday night, which tends to
fit well with the Tech competitors and their odd sleeping schedules.
Having run two great races in back to back weeks, there was hope for
an All-American performance.</P>

<P>The pace began slowly with a 73 second first quarter. The next
quarter was 71 and stayed that way. Mark moved up to the front once
the pace settled at the 3/4 mile mark. However, he seemed to fall
asleep and drift to the back during the next quarter. He gradually
drifted a little behind the group of runners as he continued his 73
second quarters while the leaders were running 71s. By the 1 3/4
mark, Strauss seemed to give up as his pace suddenly fell to 86
seconds per quarter. The last mile was 5:46 as Strauss seemed totally
used up, finishing in 16:18, far off his varsity record of 14:43, set
two weeks ago.</P>

<P>The Men's team will be going to California March 19-28 to compete
in the Santa Barbara Relays on March 20, and the UCSD Invitational on
March 27.</P>
