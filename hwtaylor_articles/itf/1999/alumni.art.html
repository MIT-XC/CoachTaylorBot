LAST EVENT</B></FONT>

<P>&nbsp;</P></CENTER>

<P>Cambridge, MA</P>

<P>December 12, 1998</P>

<P>The 25th annual Alumni Meet went to the Alumni in a very close
meet that came down to the last event, the 800 Relay, with the Alumni
behind by one point. Virtually side by side at the second handoff,
freshman Kevin Atkinson pulled his hamstring on his third step,
clinching the fourth victory in succession for the Has-Beens.</P>

<P>With Bill Singhose '90, gone to Georgia Tech as a new faculty
member, the Varsity thought the meet might have a different outcome
in 1998. Bill successfully rounded up 11 Alumni to attempt the meet
defense. </P>

<P>The Varsity began practice on November 2 with an intense 3 week
conditioning period. The Monday and Tuesday after that we did testing
in a number of events. After Thanksgiving, we began event specific
training, emphasizing the basics and strength. With only 2 weeks of
event work, coupled with the fatigue that sets in around exam time,
reality was in favor of the more experienced Alumni, even if there
were only 11 of them.</P>

<P>Singhose led the way from the beginning with a 21'4" long jump.
Captain Ravi Sastry '99, injured since last outdoor season has been
able to do very little in the way of getting prepared for the season
other than some pool work and a few drills and weight training. It
showed, as Ravi was only able to jump 20'5 1/2" for second. Kevin
Scannell '91, flew in to take third with a 19'6 1/2" effort. Morio
Alexander '96, also appeared for the Alums, but was relegated to 4th
place with a 19' 4 1/4" leap.</P>

<P>At the same time, the 35 lb. Wt. was taking place. Once again, the
Alumni were victorious with John-Paul Clarke '91, now a professor at
MIT, taking honors with a heave of 46' 9 1/2". I cannot remember the
last time a varsity member has won the Weight Throw in the Alumni
Meet. Patrick Dannen '98, also tried the weight, which he rarely did
while a member of the varsity team, but could only manage 35'11".</P>

<P>The High Jump and Pole Vault began a half hour later, but the
results were the same. Singhose won both with efforts of 6'0", and
15'6" in the High Jump and Pole Vault respectively. The Varsity
managed 2nd and 3rd in both, but that may have been because there
were no other Alumni entered. Sastry also jumped 6'0" but lost on
misses. Both Sam Thibault '00, and Matt Potts '00, qualified for the
New England Division III Championships by clearing 13' 3", and 13'
respectively.</P>

<P>So, behind 21-15, the Varsity had little to look forward to in the
two remaining field events. Singhose won both the Shot Put (44' 6
1/2"), and the Triple Jump (43' 9 1/4"). He was supported by efforts
from Dannen in the Shot (42' 7 3/4"), and by Alexander in the Triple
(43' 0 1/2"). The Varsity was now behind 37-17.</P>

<P>Without Ethan Crain able to make the trip, the Varsity began to
turn things around in the 1500 with a sweep led by Sean Montgomery
'01, running 4:07.3. Close behind were Leif Seed '99, with a 4:08.3,
and Dan Feldman '02, with a 4:09.7. Dev Sinha '93, visiting us from
Brown, tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Varsity sweep.</P>

<P>In the High Hurdles, Sastry was hoping to repeat last year's
victory over Singhose, but after shaking up the field with a
non-called flinch at the start, Singhose led the entire way, winning
in a photo finish.</P>

<P>The 400 saw another sweep by the Varsity. Neither Mark Dunzo '91,
nor Akin Aina '96, could be convinced to lend their services to their
former specialty, preferring to take on the 55 and 200. Todd
Rosenfield '01, led the sweep with a 52.7 effort. Yuval Mazor '02,
and Neal Karchem '99, finished the scoring for the Varsity. Elliot
Mason '95, made a valiant effort but could not break up the
threesome.</P>

<P>The dash was certainly one of the best events of the day. Sastry
was hoping to up end both Dunzo and Aina. Starting poorly, and well
behind Aina, Sastry began the comeback. At the line, even with Finish
Lynx providing the photo, it was impossible to determine a winner.
All three were timed in 6.5, with Aina on the outside and Dunzo on
the inside. Sastry was sandwiched in the middle and being much
smaller than either of his opponents, could not be seen except for
his nose and foot, both of which were in front but are not part of
the torso. It was determined that Dunzo and Sastry would split first
place and Aina would claim third.</P>

<P>The Alumni were only up by 4 points now and the Varsity could
smell victory. The 800 was next and once again the Varsity came up
with a sweep. Again, Montgomery led the way with a fine 1:58.7. Seed
was again the bridesmaid with John Biesiadecki '01, finishing up for
third. Chuck Van Buren '98, attempted to keep the Varsity at bay but
was unsuccessful.</P>

<P>Now ahead for the first time, the Varsity was ready for the 200.
Apparently, so were the Alumni. Sastry pulled his hamstring on the
backstretch, and Aina and Dunzo cruised to a 1-2 finish in 23.4 and
23.7 respectively.</P>

<P>Down by 2 entering the 5000, the Varsity was pleased to see that
Jesse Darley did not make the meet. However, Terry McNatt '87, did,
and that is usually enough. Terry let the Varsity runners do the
work. Chris McGuire '00, led the first half of the race along with
Mike Parkins '99, and freshman Dan Feldman. As the pace slowed to 76
pace after the 1 1/2 mile mark, Parkins and Feldman tried to push the
pace. Reluctant to take the lead as a freshman, Dan waited until the
2 1/2 mark to move. When the leaders slowed to 78 pace he took off
and ran 3:00 for the final 1000 meters to nearly take down McGuire's
freshman record of 15:10. Feldman was clocked in 15:12.6. McNatt
outkicked Parkins and McGuire to run 15:15.3 and finish 2nd.</P>

<P>Up by one point, the Varsity put their best foot forward in the
4x200 Relay. The Alumni had never won this event, but fielded a
formidable team of Singhose, Aina, Alexander, and Dunzo. Mazor led
off for the Varsity, but brought the baton in slightly behind
Singhose. Karchem was next, running a great leg, and handing the
baton off to Atkinson even with the Alumni. About to take the lead on
Alexander, Atkinson pulled up with a hamstring injury, succumbing to
the Alumni once again. The much anticipated showdown of anchors
Montgomery and Dunzo was not to be.</P>

<P>Next year vow the Varsity.</P>
