              <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Records Fall, NCAA Qualifying Performances Highlight MIT's Weekend at NEICAAA Championship</span></p>
              <p align="left">February 22-23, 2013</p>
              <p align="left">MIT sent a few athletes to the <a href="neicaaa.res.php">NEICAAA Championship</a> hosted by Boston University with the intent of improving some performances to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship in two weeks. A few athletes were rested after the exhausting effort at the New England Division III Championship the weekend before, and others were entered only in relays, using next weekend to qualify in individual events.</p>
              <p align="left">The ladies began the first segment of the meet and did so with some remarkable performances. First Lauren Kuntz '13 won the Pole Vault at a new indoor personal best of 12-7 1/2. Joanna Chen '15 and Cimran Virdi '16 both cleared 11-1 3/4 with Chen's mark being a new indoor PR.</p>
              <p align="left">Perhaps the event of the meet was the women's DMR. The top three teams all broke the meet record and two of them broke the NCAA Division III record. MIT started things off with Brooke Johnson '13 running the 1200 leg. Johnson went out with the leaders, starting out with a 35 first 200, the exact pace she wanted to run. The pace slowed to 36 and Johnson stayed with the leaders until the final lap when she was unable to quite stay with them. Her 3:35.0 put MIT in a solid third position. Cindy Huang '15, moved to the 400 leg for the first time, raced well. She went out in 28.4 trying to stay with the pure 400 runners and finished in 60.0, a great effort but the team fell back to seventh position. Alexandra Taylor '14 ran her best race ever. Due to the need to catch up to the leaders and a slight over aggressive approach, Taylor went out in 30.9 and 62.8 as she moved Tech back up to third place. She continued to race well with the leaders from Providence College and Middlebury, finishing with an amazing 2:11.4 leg. Sarah Quinn '16 continued her &quot;no fear&quot; approach to racing, staying with the two leaders through splits of 69.9 and 2:24.0 before taking the lead due to the slow pace. She dropped a 71.9, opening up a nice lead, but in the final 200 the teams started to kick, and even though Quinn still ran a 71.8 final 400 both Providence and Middlebury caught her. Quinn's 4:47.8 gave MIT an 11:34.20 time. MIT surpassed both the meet and national D3 records, but Middlebury beat them for both records and Providence won the event. Nevertheless, the quartet lowered the MIT record by an amazing 15 seconds.</p>
              <p align="left">The men started the meet off with the 400. Current freshman record holder Michael Kaba was sitting out the competition due to a tender hamstring. States Lee '16 took advantage of the opportunity to claim the freshman record. He got out very well, claimed the break, but was then mauled by an opposing runner who cut in without having a full stride clearance. This broke Lee's stride, definitely taking a lot of momentum out of his race. Lee continued to race well, finished second in the section, running 49.51, .04 under Kaba's freshman record. Tyler Singer-Clark '13 ran the fastest time for the Engineers, a 49.50, but should have been better as he should have raced the first 100 much faster. Derek Barnes '16 also improved his time, running 49.61, although he also ran his first 100 much too casually. Nick Diamantoni '15 ran a PR in the 400 as well, clocking 50.01.</p>
              <p align="left">Sam Parker '15 was hoping to qualify for nationals in the 800. He ran his best race to date as an Engineer, but tied up at the end as he allowed his stride to lengthen when he fatigued, thus slowing him down more. Parker went out in 27.2 and 55.2 as he moved up well in the pack. His 600 was 1:23.3 and he was in position to win, but then the wheels fell off the bus. He still finished with a very fast 1:53.41, but not nearly fast enough to make Nationals.</p>
              <p align="left">In the 5K, Benji Xie '15, fresh off his 14:59 PR from last week, went with the leaders in the fast section. It could not have been much better for Xie as the pace setters went through the mile at 4:39. The second mile slowed but not appreciably, as they hit 9:23. The third mile was the fastest as they ran 4:38 thanks to a 66 final 400. Xie closed well, finishing in a huge personal best of 14:35.68 for fourth place.</p>
              <p align="left">The men's DMR was the final event of the night. Logan Trimble '13 led things off for Tech. Running excellent splits of 58.2 and 2:00 to finish in 3:02.8, Trimble raced very well. States Lee took over the baton duties, and while he ran 49.7, it should have been much faster. His entire first 200 was run without any sense of urgency. Pat Marx '13 took over for the 800 leg and ran a wonderful race. He split 26.0, 54.1 and 1:22.8 before fatiguing and holding position for a 1:52.3. Kyle Hannon filled the customary duty of anchoring the relay, and went out very well, leading the chase group through a 61.3. As no one came around him, Hannon was unaware he was slowing down, which he definitely did, running the 800 in 2:05.9. Towards the end of the third quarter the runners started to pass Hannon, but he had settled on the slower pace for so long he was unable to get back up to speed. His 4:11.6 was fast, but not fast enough as the team ran 9:57.30, good for seventh place</p>
              <p align="left">The mile was the first event on Saturday. For the men, Justin Bullock '14 seemed to be getting better as he worked his way into the slow paced race, splitting 64, 2:08, 3:13 and then closing in 61 to finish in 4:14.75. On the women's side, in the second of three sections, the women, including Johnson and Nicole Zeinstra '16, got over a hundred meters into the race before they fired the gun for a recall, but the women did not react, running an entire 200 before being stopped. They were given a 15 minute break before the restart. In the second attempt at the race, Johnson took over the lead after the first quarter which was a 73 but had started too slow. Zeinstra moved up into second after the 800, which was 2:28. Johnson continued to set the pace with Zeinstra in tow, hitting the three quarter in 3:43. They closed at the same pace, finishing in 4:58.42 and 4:58.64 respectively to place seventh and eighth overall. In the fast section, Sarah Quinn went out too fast, reacting with too much aggressiveness trying to go with the leader who was really flying. Quinn hit the 400 in 67. The second quarter, with Quinn still trying too hard to run fast, was not much slower as she hit 2:19 at the 800. The third quarter was significantly slower as Quinn came through in 3:34, obviously starting to tie up. She held on the best she could but continued to fatigue, finishing with a 4:51.50 for fifth place overall. Quinn's time breaks her own MIT freshman and varsity records.</p>
              <p align="left">Back in the field events, Isabella Stuopis '16 finished seventh in the Shot Put with her second best throw of the season at 42-04 1/4 to place seventh. Michelle Johnson '15 had a season best in the Triple Jump with a 36-5. In the High Jump, Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 cleared 5-3 1/2 on her first attempt but was unable to clear 5-5 1/4.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event for MIT was the 4x400 Relay. With the nearly three second index penalty for running a 4x400 on a banked track, the Tech team knew they would need at least a 3:14 to make the National field for certain. Seeded in the fast section the opportunity would certainly be there. States Lee was the lead-off man and he did so marvelously, running a 49.0 split. Tyler Singer-Clark took the baton and went to work passing teams. He held the speed throughout the leg, running 48.8 to move MIT into third. Derek Barnes ran the third leg, certainly putting together his best effort of the year with a 48.9. Barnes held third position although the two chasing teams closed the gap to a virtual tie. At the handoff one team passed MIT and another team passed at the end of the backstretch. Pat Marx moved on the two teams, closing the gap to within a couple of feet at the finish line for a 47.9 anchor and a cumulative time of 3:14.64, a new MIT record. The old record of 3:15.74 was set by MIT's most famous 400 runners, back to back national champions; Ayisi Makatiani '90 and Mark Dunzo '91 as well as Kevin Scannell '91 and Bill Singhose '90.</p>
              <p align="left">Next week, MIT will send some of their athletes to the ECAC Division III Championship at the Armory in New York City and most of their athletes to Tufts for their Last Chance Qualifier.</p>
