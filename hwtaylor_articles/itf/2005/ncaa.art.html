  <p><strong><font size="+3">ORJI THROWS FOR NATIONAL RECORD, MIT EARNS 9TH PLACE 
    AT NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">March 11-12, 2005</p>

    Uzoma Orji set the national record today and won the NCAA Division III title 
    in the 35 lb. weight throw with a mark of 64-9 1/4, or 19.74 meters, on the 
    first day of competition at the national championships.</p>

    In the warmups, Orji threw an errant out of bounds throw, hitting an officia,l 
    who was not paying attention, in the head/neck region. The official was okay 
    after a few minutes but we were not sure the event had not taken Uzoma out 
    of his zone. On the first throw of the competition, Uzoma fouled out of the 
    sector. The second throw had the same results on the other sector line. Going 
    into the third throw Uzoma calmed down, gathered himself, and took a safety 
    throw. The result was the national record, breaking the old record of 63-11 
    3/4. The number one seed, throwing in the second flight, could not handle 
    the pressure put on him by Uzoma and fouled out. Uzoma threw another one out 
    over 62' but could not quite catch a good toe turn and two to really put the 
    record out of reach.

  <p align="left"> Nate Ball and Uzoma Orji competed at the same time in the opening 
    events on the second day of competition, the pole vault and shot put respectively. 
    In the shot, Uzoma was not able to match last year's effort but he was successful 
    enough to have his second best throw of the season even though his technique 
    was the worst it has been. He threw 56-3 3/4 to finish one centimeter out 
    of third and earn five more points for MIT. In the vault, Nate cleared 15-5 
    on his first attempt, and then at 15-9 he snapped his pole (a brand new but 
    flawed pole) on his second attempt. He was awarded another jump and cleared 
    it--a truly courageous effort. He also made 16-1 1/4 on his second attempt 
    and at that point was tied for fourth. However, at 16-5 1/4 he was not able 
    to make the height and five others did. Two eventually cleared 17-1 1/4 and 
    one of those cleared 17-5. Nate finished seventh for a final MIT total of 
    17 points, earning Tech a ninth place finish.</p>
  <p align="left">Once again, MIT ended the season as the top New England team. 
    Ball and Orji will now join the rest of the team that has been training for 
    outdoor track in preparation for another successful season. MIT will head 
    to California on the spring break trip where they will train at Claremont 
    Mudd Scripps and compete at UCSD to kick off their outdoor competition.<br>
