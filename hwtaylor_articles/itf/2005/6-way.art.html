  <p><font size="+3">TWENTY TWO SEASON OR PERSONAL BESTS LEAD WAY TO SECOND PLACE 
    FINISH</font></p>
  <p><font size="+3">MIT Finishes at 12-2</font></p>
  <p align="left">February 5, 2005</p>
  <p align="left"> Going against five Division I teams can be intimidating if 
    you are a Division III college arguably known as the top academic institution 
    in the world. However, the MIT men's track and field team does not think that 
    way. These guys looked at the competition as an opportunity to compete against 
    great athletes in a great facility at Boston University and show the Division 
    I athletes what team track and field is all about. MIT took this attitude 
    into the BU arena and came out ahead of four of the five teams with 77 points, 
    using a 8-6-4-3-2-1 scoring system. Rutgers finished in first with 131 points, 
    and behind MIT were Northeastern with 62, Providence with 54, BU with 40 and 
    Boston College with 39.</p>
  <p align="left">Leading the way with personal bests was Ben Schmeckpeper, who 
    smashed Bob Walmsley's (class of '83) varsity record of 8:27.72 in the 3000 
    with a third place finish of 8:20.69. Ben followed along with three Providence 
    College runners and John Mortimer running unattached, running along at 67 
    seconds per quarter to come through the first 1600 in 4:27. Mortimer had pulled 
    out front by a good margin, but the remaining pack of four slowed a bit and 
    Ben took the lead. Ben did not do much with the lead other than keep the pace 
    honest and was outkicked in the final lap, but still managed a 30 second final 
    200.</p>
  <p align="left">Uzoma Orji had season bests in both of his events. He led off 
    in the weight throw, taking a 59-5 to take the lead on his fifth throw to 
    win the event. Adding four points in the weight throw was David Saylor with 
    an effort of 55-6 1/2. In the shot, Uzoma continued to work on his technique 
    and although he threw 55-4 3/4, it was only good enough for a second place, 
    his first loss of the season.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's only other victory was earned by Nate Ball in the pole 
    vault. Nate was clean through 15-6, earning the victory as the only one to 
    clear that height. At 16-0 he had three good attempts but was not able to 
    put it all together. Going through 15-6 with no misses will help Ball's confidence 
    as he enters the championships and the higher starting heights. Supporting 
    Nate's effort in the vault was Nestor Hernandez, who cleared 14-0 for the 
    second week in a row, earning 2 points for fifth place.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina, hoping for a 200 varsity record, had to settle 
    for second place with a 22.55. Traina also scored second in the 55 dash and 
    added a great leadoff of 50.7 in the 1600 relay that placed third.</p>
  <p align="left">Although he only scored one point, Fivos Constantinou had a 
    great day in the mile and 800 meter races. In the mile, Fivos opened with 
    a high 61 and was at the back of the pack led by sub 4:00 miler Mark Carroll, 
    running unattached. Fivos came through splits of 2:07 and 3:13, showing he 
    was unsure of himself and the fast pace being set by the leaders. Unleashing 
    a 63 final 440, Fivos moved up to sixth place to earn a point for the Engineers 
    and run a personal best of 4:16.19. In the 800, Constantinou raced to another 
    PR of 1:57.74, but this was not fast enough to score.</p>
  <p align="left">Makinde Adeagbo had a great effort in his final attemp in the 
    triple jump, decreasing his contact time between phases and jumping to a PR 
    of 43-8 1/2. Makinde's performance earned him third place and four points.</p>
  <p align="left">In the middle distances, supporting Constantinou's efforts, 
    Carlos Renjifo and Eric Khatchadourian ran solid 1000's, running 2:34.93 and 
    2:34.97 respectively. Renjifo, not racing in four weeks as he recovered from 
    a lower back injury, earned sixth place for his efforts. Erik Stafl, even 
    though he did not place, had two very good races, running personal bests in 
    both the mile (4:29.70) and the 1000 (2:38.10).</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT will split their squad, sending some back to 
    BU for the Valentine's Fasttrack Invitational to improve their seed performances 
    for the upcoming championships. The rest of the team will be at home to compete 
    in the Coed Invitational.</p>
