  <p align="left">As expected, as the championships get bigger, the star power 
    on MIT's indoor team shines brighter and brighter. On the first day of competition 
    at the Boston University indoor track, the Tech men scored nine points, putting 
    them in seventh place as three different Engineers earned points. On day two, 
    the Engineers added five more points to record the highest number of points 
    for MIT at this meet in modern history.</p>
  <p align="left">Leading things off for MIT was Nate Ball in the pole vault. 
    As usual the starting height at the IC4A was very high, and also as usual, 
    seven of the 17 vaulters went out at the first height of 15-5. Ball cleared 
    this on his first attempt. At 15-9, Ball had a more difficult time, but still 
    managed to clear on his third attempt. At this point there were only eight 
    vaulters remaining. The bar was moved to 16-1 and again Ball made the height 
    on his first attempt. Two others made the height on first attempt, two passed 
    the height and another vaulter made it on his second attempt to bring the 
    field to six. At 16-5 only two vaulters succeeded and Ball was not one of 
    them. However, he earned third place based on misses, earning six points for 
    MIT. </p>
  <p align="left">In the weight throw, both Uzoma Orji and Dave Saylor made the 
    field. On Orji's opening throw, he threw one well over 61' but it was called 
    a foul. Although it looked like a clean throw to most, a foul may have occurred 
    after the release. Orji's second throw was a sector foul so now he had to 
    come through. On his third attempt, Orji took a safety throw, leaving at least 
    two feet to spare in the circle. The mark was 59-8 1/4, good enough to get 
    him into the finals in fifth place. Saylor, throwing in the second flight, 
    threw 57-5 in the trials and then had to wait to see if this would get him 
    into the finals. The throw held up for eighth place going into the finals. 
    In the finals, Orji could not find the speed and position to get him a better 
    throw. Two throwers passed him in the finals, relegating him to seventh place. 
    Saylor had a great series and tied his personal record with a throw of 57-7 
    3/4 to earn eighth place and one point for the Engineers.</p>
  <p align="left">Zach Traina took to the track in the 200 as MIT's only runner. 
    Traina had been sick the latter half of the week and was still a little under 
    the weather at race time. Nevertheless, Traina had a solid performance, running 
    22.11, missing finals by only two places.</p>
  <p align="left">On day two, Orji was the only MIT athlete competing. He was 
    seeded pretty far down in the shot but put together his best series by far 
    this year to enter the finals in fourth place with a throw of 55-11. In the 
    finals he started off with 56-3 1/4 to move into third place. In the final 
    round he was passed by the thrower behind him. Orji responded with a 57-5 
    1/2 effort but it was not enough to move back into third. This mark was over 
    two feet better than what he had done so far this season. </p>
  <p align="left">Ben Schmeckpeper, who had qualified in both the 3000 and 5000, 
    did not run due to the fact that the 5000 was held on Sunday, a day after 
    the deadline for NCAA championship marks. He therefore ran at a last chance 
    qualifier on Friday night at Yale but was unable to improve on his mark.</p>
  <p align="left">Also qualifying but not participating was the MIT distance medley 
    relay team. The relay was pretty far away from being able to score or qualify 
    for the NCAA championships so Coach Halston Taylor decided it was in their 
    best interest to use the time to prepare for the outdoor season.</p>
  <p align="left">On Wednesday, MIT heads to Bloomington, Illinois to compete 
    in the NCAA Division III Championship. Ball and Orji are definites to get 
    in and look to be ready to score big for MIT. Saylor and Schmeckpeper are 
    on the bubble, but are ready to produce if given the opportunity.</p>
