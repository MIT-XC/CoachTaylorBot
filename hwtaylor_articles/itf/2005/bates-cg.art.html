  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT ENGINEERS CONVINCING VICTORY OVER BEARS AND BOBCATS</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">JANUARY 15, 2005</p>
  <p align="left"> The MIT men's track and field team hosted the Bears from the 
    Coast Guard Academy and the Bobcats from Bates College on Saturday at the 
    Shobrys and Aronson Track. Based on the entries and marks supplied by Bates 
    and Coast Guard, the meet was seeded to be close with Bates predicted to be 
    within one point of the Engineers. Bates had to scratch their top middle distance 
    runner, a favorite in both the 1500 and 800 meter races and many of their 
    other athletes did not appear up to the performances listed on their entries. 
    Coast Guard on the other hand came ready to compete, scoring more than they 
    were seeded to get and finishing second in the meet with 102 points. MIT performed 
    well in most events and made up for some errors in other events to come out 
    on top with 162 points. Bates placed third with 88 points. Scoring in the 
    meet went six places deep, 7-5-4-3-2-1 in individual events and 7-4-0 in the 
    relays.</p>
  <p align="left">Tech knew they would have to perform better than they did the 
    past week against the MIT alumni if they hoped to start the season with two 
    victories. Bates College is particularly strong in the throwing events and 
    the Engineers knew if they wanted to take down the Bobcats they would need 
    to start by winning the weight throw. MIT's goal would not be an easy one 
    as Scott Cooper and Dustin Gauthier of Bates were ranked number two and three 
    in the country for division III. However, Uzoma Orji, who placed fifth at 
    the NCAA Division III Championship last year, appeared up to the challenge. 
    Unknown to many throughout the country was David Saylor, who red shirted last 
    year, and is now throwing extremely well. Orji threw in the first flight, 
    easily winning with a 54-0. The second flight had all the other good throwers 
    and they were ready right from the start. Cooper unleashed a 57-00 1/2 PR 
    to show he intended on winning. Saylor was next and he responded with a 57-4 
    1/4 personal best. Gauthier threw well but only responded with a 52-9 1/2. 
    In the third round Saylor increased his lead with a toss of 57-8 and Gauthier 
    passed Orji with a 54-4 effort. Starting the finals, Orji showed his pride 
    as he went from fourth to first with a throw of 57-9 to end the debate and 
    give MIT a 1-2 finish in the first event.</p>
  <p align="left">Going on at the same time was the long jump. MIT had a plethora 
    of jumpers but no one seemed ready to jump far. Fortunately for MIT, no one 
    on either team seemed ready to make the leap. Nestor Hernandez took the victory 
    with a 20-10 1/4 effort and was supported by his team mates who placed third, 
    fourth and sixth to give MIT 15 points in the event.</p>
  <p align="left">The other key event for MIT was the 1500. Prior to the Bates 
    runner scratching, MIT figured they would need to have a great effort in this 
    the first running event in order to keep Bates from gaining confidence. With 
    Bates' scratch the MIT runners were seeded two, three and four behind Mike 
    Flint from the Coast Guard Academy. Already prepared to run fast, they did 
    not waste the adrenaline as they ran a very aggressive race, taking the pace 
    out in 61 at the quarter, 2:07 at the half and 3:12 at the 1200. Flint was 
    able to pull away to win in 3:59 but Tech runners were close behind with Fivos 
    Constantinou in 4:00.9, Ben Schmeckpeper in 4:01.2 and Carlos Renjifo placing 
    fourth in 4:01.9.</p>
  <p align="left">With the momentum in their favor, the rest of the meet just 
    fell into place for the Engineers. Freshmen Anthony Teixeira, Omari Stephens 
    and Chris Desrochers boosted the scoring for the class of '08 with a total 
    of 24 points. Stephens placed third in the pole vault with a jump of 12-9 
    and earned fourth in the 55HH with a 8.61. Teixeira placed third in the triple 
    jump with a 41-5 1/2 and ran a PR in the 55HH to place third in 8.50. Desrochers 
    place fourth in the high jump with a 5-8 leap, third in the long jump with 
    19-9 1/2 and fifth in the high hurdles with a PR of 8.73.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT earned eight first places among the 17 events. Orji backed 
    his weight throw victory with a win in the shot put on his 54-9 1/2 heave. 
    Zach Traina earned victories in the both the 55 and 200 meter dashes with 
    times of 6.72 and 23.23. Constantinou came back from his second in the 1500 
    to win the 800 in a personal indoor best of 1:59.57. Freshman Erik Stafl earned 
    his first collegiate victory by taking first place honors in the 1000 over 
    teammate Sam Berberian, both running 2:40.95. The 1600 relay team also ran 
    to victory with Jesse Collins getting a lead for Tech they never lost as Kenny 
    Rosche, Matt Clancy and Traina finished in 3:30.57.</p>
  <p align="left">With a very challenging schedule that boasts four division I 
    teams, six of their seven division III New England opponents being among the 
    top ten teams in New England and the defending New York State division III 
    champion in RPI, MIT will have to continue to improve throughtout the season 
    if they hope to claim a winning record. Next week they are again at home as 
    they host RPI, Westfield State and defending New England Division III Champion, 
    Williams College. The meet will start at 12:00 noon.</p>
