<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="5">MIT GETS BACK INTO COMPETITION AFTER HOLIDAY BREAK

WITH BEAVER RELAYS<br>

</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">This past Saturday MIT hosted the annual Beaver Relays with Coast Guard,

Tufts, and UMass/Boston in attendance. The purpose of this non-scoring invitational is

simply to get the athletes back in the habit of competing after the Holiday Break.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Tech showed that while they may have worked out on their own over the

past three weeks they certainly need some more practice at competing. With the Quad Cup

Meets beginning next week and the first one entertaining Williams College, MIT used this

meet to get themselves ready.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Leading the way in performance was Ravi Sastry '98 who won the 55 Meter

Dash with a time of 6.92, the High Hurdles (8.05), and earned second in the Long Jump with

a jump of 21-4 3/4.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Another winner was freshmen Todd Rosenfield in the 400 Meter Run with a

very competitive time of 52.70. Neal Karchem also placed in the 400, clocking a 53.53

performance.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Joel Ford '98 appeared healthy and recovered from an early season injury

when he won the 800 with a 2:00.78 effort. Freshman John Biesiadecki did not place but

showed promise by running 2:04.82.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Mike Parkins '99 got back on track by running 8:49.05 in the 3000 Meter

Run. Mike is the defending New England Division III Champion in the 3000. It looks as

though Mike will be a strong contender for the defense of his title.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT won three of the four relays. The Shuttle Hurdle Relay was anchored

by Sastry who pulled away from a close battle with Tufts. Tech walked away in the 1600

Meter Relay as Rosenfield, Leif Seed '99, Ford, and Karchem proved too much for their

competition.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the Distance Medley Relay, Mark Strauss '01, Tony Pelosi '01, Sohail

Husain '98, and Parkins brought home the gold. Parkins anchored with a 4:25 mile.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT Pole Vaulters swept places 1-4 with Matt Potts '00 leading the way

with a 12-6 jump. Following close behind were Sam Sidiqi '99, and Steve Lefkowitz '00,

both making 11-6.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The only other event won by MIT was Mike Butville '98 in the 35# Weight

Throw. Mike threw 51-1 1/2 as he once again flirted with the National Qualifying standard.</font>

</p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Next week, the first of four consecutive Quad Cup Meets will see Tech go

against Williams, WPI, and UMass/Dartmouth at MIT.</font> </p>
