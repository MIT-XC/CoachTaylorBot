<p>On Friday night, Ravi Sastry '98 equalled his 22'0.25&quot; PR in the Long Jump and

placed 8th. In the High Hurdles Ravi scored the only points for MIT by placing fourth in

running just .01 off of his recent PR. He also won his trial heat easily in the 55 Meter

Hurdles in a PR :07.90, and ran 7.93 in the Semi-Finals.</p>



<p>Joel Ford ran a strong 1000 Meter trial, clocking 2:31.91 and qualifying for Saturday's

final. Joel opened up much faster in the finals. He came through the 400 in 57 seconds and

the 800 in 1:58. However, Joel could not hold onto the pace as once again he faded in the

last 100 meters. Nevertheless he ran 2:30.81 and qualified for next weekend's IC4A

Championship at Cornell. Misfortune struck Sohail Husain '98, however, as he got tripped

up and knocked to the track early in the race, and was never able to regain contact with

the field, running 2:47.22 for his effort.</p>



<p>Neal Karchem '99 ran a lifetime indoor best in the 400 Meters, spinning the 2 laps in

:52.08. Todd Rosenfield '01 fared not quite so well, with a :52.64</p>



<p>In the 5000 Meters, Sophomore Chris McGuire raced to an indoor PR 15:02.47, moving him

up to 6th on the All Time MIT Indoor List, and finished 8th. Junior Mike Parkins started

like a house afire but ended up paying a price for his early aggression, and finished in

15:12.19.</p>



<p>The Distance Medley Relay squad did establish the Freshman Indoor Record for that

event, but they were hampered by being in the seeded heat. Division 3 freshmen taking on

Division 1 seniors seems like a bit of a mismatch on paper, and it was. Still, the gallant

foursome of Ken Walker (3:14.0), ToddRosenfield (:52.4), John Biesiadecki (2:03.0), and

Phil Loiselle (4:32) combined for a respectable 10:41.77</p>



<p>In the Weight Throw, junior Jason Dailey fell victim to a disobedient right leg, and

couldn't find the power position necessary for superior throwing. His 45'10&quot; toss was

well off his season best of 50'8&quot;.</p>



<p>The 4x800 Meter Relay turned in an excellent performance to close out the day. Running

in the unseeded heat, Ken Walker led off with a personal best 2:00.0, that put us right in

the thick of things. John Biesiadecki unleashed a beautiful pass-on-the-inside,

then-on-the-outside spurt in his final 100 meters and gave us the lead with an indoor best

1:57.6. Joel Ford then rocketed away with a typical Joel Ford quarter (:53.8) and blasted

open a large lead with his 1:57.0 split. Leif Seed '99 then stormed his four laps in an

impressive 1:54.4 for a team time of 7:49.10. That mark easily surpasses the IC4A

qualifying time, and earns the quartet the right to compete at Cornell University next

weekend against the best teams in the east.</p>
