<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="5">Alumni Race To Victory Against Varsity <br>

<br>

</font></b></p>



<p>Going into the 1997 Indoor Track and Field Alumni Meet, the rebuilding Varsity knew

that if Bill Singhose '90 were to do his usual job of recruiting Alumni back for the meet

then they would be at the short end of the score at the end of the meet. He did, and they

did, by a score of 74-48. </p>



<p>John Wallberg '96 flew in from Texas to secure the victory in the 35# Weight Throw with

a heave of 54-09 1/4. John was followed by John-Paul Clarke '91 for second place. </p>



<p>In the Long Jump, Ravi Sastry '98 won one of only three individual events won by the

varsity with a jump of 21-01 1/4. This jump forced Singhose to overdo it and pull his

hamstring on his last effort in an attempt to win the event. </p>



<p>Bill still had enough to win the Pole Vault (13-09), tie for 3rd in the High Jump

(5-08), place 2nd in the Shot Put (41-09 1/2), and place 2nd in the High Hurdles (8.50).

The other 17 alumni who competed more than made up for anything Singhose was lacking. </p>



<p>In the High Jump, Andy Ugarov '95 won easily with a leap of 6-06. Andy was supported by

Singhose and Hung Hoang '96 at 5-08. </p>



<p>The 1500 was no contest for a fit Ethan Crain '95, as he took control with a 400 to go

to win in 4:05.36. Gordon Holterman '86 borrowed some spikes to assist him in taking 2nd

place with a 4:09.40 performance. </p>



<p>Ravi Sastry won his 2nd event, albeit over an injured Singhose with 8.09 time in the 55

Meter High Hurdles. Freshman Junius Ho almost overtook Singhose with a 8.59 effort. </p>



<p>As usual the Alumni were unable to field an adequate 400 squad. Coach Taylor said,

&quot;I guess I worked those 400 runners so hard while they were here that they don't want

to come back&quot;. The varsity swept the event led by Neal Karchem '99 with a time of

53.53. Neal was followed by freshman Todd Rosenfield and Martin Suresh '99. </p>



<p>In addition to Singhose garnering 2nd place in the Shot Put, Wallberg captured 1st

place with a put of 45-05 and Clarke completed the sweep with a throw of 40-10 1/4. </p>



<p>The Alumni had back to back sweeps with a 1-2-3 finish in the Triple Jump. Morio

Alexander '96 led the way with a jump of 43-11 1/4. Andy Ugarov was next at 42-07 1/4.

Hung Hoang completed the sweep with an effort of 40-04 1/2. </p>



<p>Akin Aina '95 needed no help from his teammates, but perhaps a little assistance from

the finish evaluator. Akin took first place in the 55 Meter Dash, literally edging out

Ravi Sastry as they were both timed in 6.85 seconds. </p>



<p>Ethan Crain came back in the 800, but freshman sensation Sean Montgomery had a little

surprise in store. The plan was to follow Ethan in what was presumed to be a slow pace and

take the lead with 300 to go. Ethan predicted this and took the pace out pretty hard,

coming through the 400 in 58. Sean did not adapt the plan to take the lead at 250, but

stuck to the plan. In addition he did not pass before the curve and got hung out in lane 2

for part of it. It was a little too far to hold off the experienced Crain. Ethan passed

Sean at the finish as they finished 1:57.74 and 1:57.85 respectively. </p>



<p>Aina once again earned victory in the 200 Meter Dash in 24.29. The Varsity's closest

competitor was Karchem in 24.46. </p>



<p>The 5000 was a great race with Jesse Darley '95, Terry McNatt '87, and Arnold Seto '96

doing battle with Mike Parkins '99 for 4000 of the 5000 meter race. Darley slowed down to

force Parkins to take the lead. Parkins did not pull away, and shortly thereafter Darley

and McNatt surged past Parkins for good. Darley won in 15:19.19, McNatt was second in

15:20.34, and Parkins finished the scoring with a 15:21.91. </p>



<p>Holding onto a little dignity, the varsity remained undefeated in this meet in the

4x200 Relay. The Varsity team of Marc Bourget '01, Todd Rosenfield '01, Sean Montgomery

'01, and Neal Karchem '99 easily outran the Old Guys (Alexander, Mason '95, Crain, and

Aina), 1:38.58 to 1:40.48.<br>
