<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="+2">MIT PLACES 2ND AT NEW ENGLAND DIV. III CHAMPIONSHIP</font></b></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">MIT was seeded 6th behind Williams, Bates, Bowdoin, Brandeis, and

Amherst going into the New England Division III Championships held this past weekend at

Bowdoin College. Performing true to tradition and form, the Engineers ran, jumped, and

threw their way to a 2nd place finish, two points behind Williams College.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">Leading the way for Tech was Ravi Sastry '98. Ravi competed in the

pentathlon on Friday, earning a 2nd place behind Williams' Sasaki-Scanlon with a personal

best 3221 points. In the Long Jump they saw each other again, but this time Ravi got the

upper hand with a season best jump of 22-00 1/4. Sasaki-Scanlon jumped 21-4, but pulled

his hamstring on his next attempt. This effectively took the top seed out of the Pole

Vault, and the 3rd seed out of the High Hurdles. This opened the door for MIT.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">The next final that MIT scored in was the Shot Put, where Patrick

Dannen '98, came through, placing 5th with a throw of 44-8 3/4 on his final effort. This

pulled Pat from 7th place, and came within a centimeter of 4th.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">Mike Parkins '99, took the line in the 1500, the first part of a

difficult double, against a very quality field led by Amherst junior Rob Mitchell, a 4:03

miler. Mike ran a personal best of 3:59.24 to earn 4th place. Mike felt terrible after the

race, in part because he thought he should have placed higher but also because of the fast

early pace and jostling that took place in the middle of the pack.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">Sastry was up next in the High Hurdles. Ravi was seeded 1st and he did

not disappoint, running a personal best of 7.92 to win easily. Also scoring for MIT was

freshman Junius Ho, placing 6th with a personal best of 8.34.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">At this point, it was shaping up as a 3 team race among Williams, MIT,

and Bates. A lot of Bates success would depend on the Pole Vault and the relays. Williams

was counting on a big 3000 race and some relays. MIT was hoping for a lot of people to

place a lot higher than they were seeded.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">MIT did not have any entries in the 55, 200, 600, or 800 meters,

choosing instead to take marginal potential scorers and form some really strong relays.

Todd Rosenfield '01, ran a strong 400 in 52.26 but could not make the finals.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">Joel Ford '98, running well come Championship time is as sure a thing

as having cold weather in the winter. Joel unfortunately had to compete against Mitchell

from Amherst and a top 800 runner who decided to run the typically less competitive 1000.

Having less speed than these other two, Joel took the race out at an even 30 second per

200 pace. Leading the middle 600 meters, Joel could not kick with the top two seeds and

faded to 3rd in 2:33.88. Joel was disappointed but it was a marvelously run race and about

all he could expect to do.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">The Pole Vault was shaping up as quite a battle between Sam Thibault

'00 and a Bates vaulter. Thibault was ahead on misses as 6 vaulters cleared 13-06.

However, at 14-00, only the Bates vaulter cleared, giving him 1st place and Thibault 2nd,

which was a big help to the Engineers.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">Mike Parkins was up for his second race, the 3000, but did not seem to

be the confident runner who laid to waste the rest of New England Division 3 this season.

Mike immediately went to the back of the pack and stayed about 10 meters off the leader.

The pace was not too fast (70 second pace), but fast enough to allow for good times. Mike

stayed on pace until the 2000 meter mark when the leaders picked up the pace. Mike let

them go initially but battled back to fight and win the battle for 6th place in 8:47.46.

Williams placed 1, 3, 4 in this race to pull back ahead of MIT.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">Most of the top runners chose not to run the 5000, thus leaving the

door open for Chris McGuire '00, who was planning on running much better than his 15:33

seed. Chris ran with the pack for the early part of the race as they went through 72

second quarters for the first 2400 meters. The pace fell to 75s for the next mile and a

quarter, and Chris was content to sit and kick. Kick he did, running his last 600 meters

in 1:39, narrowly escaping a furious final 200 by a Tufts runner to win in 15:09.07.

Williams managed to get 5th place, putting them 8 points ahead of MIT and Bates going into

the relays.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">The Distance Medley Relay (DMR) was first on the schedule. Tech's team

was high in potential but untested in championships. Sohail Husain '98, led things off by

taking the lead in the 1200 leg. Sohail finished in second with a fine 3:14 split after

having run his first quarter in 61. Chuck Van Buren '98, dropped down from the 800 to run

his first competitive 400 race. Chuck ran great although he lost some ground to some

better 400 runners. He came in 4th with a 54.3 leg. Gus Blomquist '99, took the baton for

the 800 leg, running a well planned personal best of 2:02.5. Even though he ran a great

race, Gus handed the baton to freshman Phil Loiselle in 5th place. Phil went out hard (62)

and moved up well. By the 1200 mark Phil had moved up to 3rd and looked like he may stay

there. However, the Brandeis runner came back to kick past Phil, putting MIT in 4th with a

time of 10:38.18. Williams was 5th and Bates did not score.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">MIT had a very strong 3200 Relay, but needed to score in the 1600 Relay

in order for the 3200 Relay to have a chance of catching Williams. Ravi Sastry got things

started with a great 52.8 leadoff in his first 400 of the season. Ravi was nursing a very

sore ankle and went out very cautiously, but came on very strong at the finish. Neal

Karchem '99, took the baton in 6th and was able to move up even with the 4th and 5th place

runners, but MIT had to go all the way outside to hand off for the second straight leg. By

this point, Tech had run about 15 meters further than the leading teams. Ed Tolson '01 ran

a solid 52.9 leg to move MIT into 5th and in a position to finish no worse than 6th

overall. However, Todd Rosenfield '01, was passed almost immediately by the runner-up in

the open 400 and became frustrated at not being able to make up ground on the pack ahead

of him. This ultimately permitted Tufts University to capture 6th place out of the slower

section by 4 tenths of a second. Bates did not score but Williams earned 3rd place thus

clinching the New England Division III Championship.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">However, the 3200 Meter Relay still had to be run and there is a good

story to tell. MIT had not a fast 3200 Relay all season, primarily because there was never

a need in order to win a meet and there is usually only 1 section in this event. Well,

this time there were 12 teams entered, we were seeded 9th, and our constitution only

permits 1 section when there are 9 or fewer teams entered. This meant that MIT would run

in the slower, first section without a great deal of competition.</font></p>



<p><font SIZE="+1">As mentioned before, Tech had entered a very strong relay and was

confident they could defend their title in the event. Ken Walker '01, learning to run in

the front, ran a personal best 2:01 to put MIT in the lead. John Biesiadecki '01, out most

of the season with an injured quad, ran brilliantly considering he opened with a 27 first

200. John opened the lead to 50 meters with a 2:02 split. Taking the baton next was Joel

Ford. Joel thrives in situations like this. Opening up with 55 first quarter, Joel nearly

lapped some teams as he finished in 1:58. Leif Seed '99, injured for the entire season up

until last week went out hard knowing that every inch might matter when the faster section

ran. Leif began lapping the field as he also went out in 55. Leif finished his race very

strong in 1:57, giving MIT a total time of 7:59.78. Tech anxiously waited for the fast

section to run to find out if they would win, not necessarily to see if they lost to

Williams by 2 or 4 points. Amherst College did not disappoint as they made it close enough

that no one trusted their stop watches or their ability to time quite that much. The final

announcement had MIT winning by .23 seconds, thus finishing 2 points behind Williams

College.</font></p>
