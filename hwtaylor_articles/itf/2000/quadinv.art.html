Way In Quad Cup Invite</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>February 12, 2000</P>

<P>The MIT Men's Track and Field team was at home this Saturday
against six other teams from New England and New York in a
non-scoring Invitational. The fact that the meet was non-scoring
allowed individuals to focus on one or two events without having to
be concerned about how it would affect the team's point total. This
also allowed MIT to rest a few individuals who were tired or banged
up from the exhausting Quad Cup series.</P>

<P>Twenty five season and personal bests marked the day as Tech
athletes prepared for next weeks Division III Championships. In the
morning, Peter Bluvas '01, and Roger Nielsen '01, significantly
improved their pentathlon scores to better their chances of making
the top 12 who qualify for the Championship. Peter started with a
horrible 1st hurdle in the 55HH, but rebounded in other events to
finish with 2936 points. Roger improved his early season total by 300
points to finish with 2772. Last year, MIT finished 2-3-4 in the Div.
III Meet and hope to make a run at that again if things go well.</P>

<P>In the dash, Kamal Mokeddem '01, Kevin Atkinson '01, and Alex
Rodriguez '00, all had season bests with respective times of 7.04,
7.06, and 7.07. These three, along with Todd Rosenfield '01, and Marc
Washington '03, received season bests in the 200 with Rosenfield
leading the way in 23.46, the 11th best performance of all time for
MIT.</P>

<P>In the 600, Sean Montgomery '01, made the move down to get some
speed in and attempt to break Yuval Mazor's 1 week old record of
1:24.20. Break it he did, with splits of 26, 27, 28, Sean went wire
to wire by himself in 1:21.40. This should certainly give opponents
something to think about at next week's Championships.</P>

<P>The 800 Meter race was mostly a test to see who was going to
represent MIT on the 3200 Relay at the next week's meet. Mazor moved
up to test the waters for the first time and did so admirably in
2:01.16. Matt Yarosz '00, (2:04.26), Kenny Walker '01, (2:04.80),
Craig Wildman '03, (2:05.24), and Damian Plummer '02, (2:07.03) all
ran season bests for MIT.</P>

<P>John Biesiadecki '01, gave the 1000 a try for the first time, and
came away with a fine 2:37.15 performance. Phil Loiselle '01, and
Sean Nolan '03, did the same in the 1500, running 4:11.7 and 4:12.9
respectively.</P>

<P>Dan Feldman '02, needed a better time in the 5000 in order to
secure getting into the All New England Championship in two weeks and
did not disappoint as he ran 14:57.44. Finishing 2nd with his own
season best was Ed Keehr '01, who ran 15:40.42.</P>

<P>The 3200 Relay team, hoping to run a time that would guarantee
getting into the fastest section next week, ran George Hanson '03,
and Alan Raphael '02, fresh while doubling back Biesiadecki and
Loiselle. Raphael ran 1:59 and Biesiadecki 2:01 to lead MIT to a
8:11.05 season best time.</P>

<P>Kalpak Kothari '01, is rounding into end of season form, as he had
numerous jumps over 43 feet. Kalpak finished with an official 44-03
leap in the Triple Jump, but did have a monstrous leap over 45' that
was a very close foul.</P>

<P>MIT, along with Bates, Bowdoin, Tufts, and Williams should be in
the hunt for the Division III Title.</P>
