CHAMPIONSHIP</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>March 11, 2000</P>

<P>The MIT Men's Track and Field team sent 5 individuals to the NCAA
Division III Indoor Championship hosted by Illinois Wesleyan.
Qualifying were Sean Montgomery '01, in the 1500, Chris McGuire '00,
in the 5000, and Matt Lehman '03, Yuval Mazor '02, and Todd
Rosenfield '01, along with Montgomery in the 1600 Meter Relay.</P>

<P>On Friday evening, Montgomery got things started for Tech with the
1500. The early pace was good and Sean was content to sit in the back
and let the race develop. The first quarter was 62 and the 800 split
was 2:06. Montgomery moved up to the lead of the pack after 600
meters, and at the 800 mark began to pull away, which was "definitely
not in the game plan," according to Coach Taylor. Sean through in a
59.5 400 as he came through the 1200 in 3:06. Coming down the
homestretch with a lap to go, Sean was looking around as if he
thought the race was about over. When the bell sounded for the last
lap, Sean looked bewildered. With 100 meters to go the trail group
had caught Sean who was able to offer no response. He managed to
finish 5th out of 6 in his heat with a 3:57.73 performance. He and
his teammates would have to wait until the 2nd heat to see if his
performance would get him into the finals.</P>

<P>Upon speaking with Sean it seems that in his continued quest to
run less than the appropriate distance (see Beaver Relays), he did
not count the laps, and not hearing any splits, went by the lap
counter, which was apparently a lap off. Thus Sean thought he only
had 2 1/2 laps to go when he began his move.</P>

<P>It turned out a runner in his heat was disqualified, and his time
beat two individuals in the 2nd heat, which got him into the
finals.</P>

<P>Also on Friday's schedule was the 1600 Relay. Rosenfield led
things off for the Engineers, who were seeded 7th out of the 8 teams
entered. Todd seemed tight as he ran in the rear of his heat. Coming
around the 2nd turn on the first lap, as the runners went by, the
inspector raised his yellow flag, which indicates a foul has been
committed. Todd finished with a 51.1 leadoff, which unfortunately put
Tech about 10 meters behind the pack. Lehman was next, and he ran a
fine leg of 50.1, but was not able to make up any ground during his
leg. Mazor tood off after the pack with a 23.1 first 200, catching 1
team at the end of the first lap. On the second lap, Yuval was passed
back by that team, but they both passed another team on the
homestretch. Yuval turned in a 49.9 split on a track with the same
radius at MIT's track. Montgomery got the baton slightly in third
place but soon lost that position as his start was severely hampered
by a strained hamstring he had developed in practice on Tuesday. Not
being able to pull out of the relay without being disqualified from
the meet, Sean was forced to run the race and give an honest effort.
After mulitple electrical stimulation treatment since the occurence
of the injury, it appeared he would be okay, although his
acceleration was limited. Once up to speed Sean was able to run a
50.8 leg, but that was not good enough against the other anchor legs.
It turned out it was for naught as MIT was the team that was
disqualified was stepping on the lane line, although video indicates
that it was UW Lacrosse that had committed the infraction.</P>

<P>Saturday, things began for MIT with the first running event, the
1500. Montgomery seemed confident, although he probably still had
some doubts due to Friday's miscalculation. The pace was adequate for
the first 400 at 63 seconds. Sean was staying out of trouble, sitting
in the back of the pack. Nothing changed as the end of the pack came
through 2:07 for the half. With 500 meters to go, the pack began to
spread out and Sean moved into the middle but not where he should
have been. With 300 to go, Sean came through in 3:10 and was less
than two seconds behind the leaders. Instead of moving, Sean looked
out of gas back in 8th place. Finally, with 100 meters to go, he woke
up and moved past two more runners to move into 5th place, where he
finished in 3:55.03. Sean earned his first All-American award with
that finish.</P>

<P>McGuire running the 5000 would be the final participant for MIT at
these nationals. Chris was the last seed and knew the odds were
against him placing, but he was determined to succeed. The first mile
was a steady diet of 71 second quarters. In fact, the second mile was
the same as the first as Chris came through the 2 mile in 9:30. Chris
was in the back waiting for an opening to move or for someone to
begin fading. However, Chris was the one to fade. As the leaders
picked up the pace in the final 1/2 mile, Chris slowed to 75 second
400s. It took a time in the low 14:40s to place on the tight track,
which was a little too ambitious for Chris at this time.</P>

<P>It has been a very successful Indoor season, including a record of
16-0, winning the New England Division III Championship, having 7
individuals meet the qualifying standard for the National
Championship, and earning one All-American award. The Engineers will
now get ready for the Outdoor season with a spring trip to California
from March 20-27.</P>
