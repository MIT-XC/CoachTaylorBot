PERFORMANCES AT NEW ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIPS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>February 25, 2000</P>

<P>Most of the New England Division III Championship team elected to
exercise their option to focus on their academics and getting ready
for Outdoor Track rather than looking for a personal best against the
Division I schools at this weekend's All Division New England
Championships being held at Boston University.</P>

<P>Of those who elected to continue in order to try and qualify for
Nationals or set a record, the highlight for MIT on day one of
competition was easily the 5000. Chris McGuire '00, and Dan Feldman
'02, both suffering from slight colds this week, nevertheless ran
NCAA provisional qualifying marks of 14:48.10, and 14:49.91
respectively. Both also qualified for the IC4A Championships next
weekend at Harvard, and may try again for an automatic qualifying
time.</P>

<P>Also on Saturday, Robbie Gray '02, jumped 21-04 1/2 to place 7th,
1 place out of the scoring in the Long Jump. Craig Mielcarz '03, was
not quite himself as he cleared 6-5 but failed to make his usual 6-7.
Sean Montgomery '01, wasted a lot of energy in the Mile responding to
everyone's adjusting moves in a tight race, and was not able to
respond when they really moved, fading to 4:17.36. Yuval Mazor '02,
ran a great 500, turning in a 1:05.98 to move him to number 4 on the
all-time MIT list.</P>

<P>Day two did not look like it was going to be so good when Kalpak
Kothari '01, continued his fouling woes in the Triple Jump. Kalpak
has some good distance, but unfortunately, they were all fouls by
about 1 inch.</P>

<P>Freshman Sean Nolan, came to this meet to try and take down the
freshman record in the 3000. However, Sean was suffering from a mild
respiratory problem and was unable to keep the pace after the first
mile. He faded to 9:06 at the end of the race.</P>

<P>Last on the list of competitors for MIT was the 1600 Relay, which
thought they had a chance of qualifying provisionally for Nationals
(3:20.94) since they would be fresh for the first time this season.
Seeded 10th with a time of 3:23.18, the MIT team was to run in the
4th of 6 sections on the 4 lane track. Leadoff runner, Todd
Rosenfield '01, got off to a great start of 23.4 for the first 200.
Todd held onto 2nd place as he handed off to Matt Lehman '03, in
49.9. Matt took the lead as he came down the home stretch on the
first lap, running 23.5 for the first 200. Matt did not seem to let
up as he extended the lead to a little over 5 meters with his 49.5
leg. Yuval took over the third leg and proceeded to open up a bigger
lead over the rest of the field with the exception of Bentley
College. With a first lap of 23.5, Yuval held on to a 5 meter lead.
By the time he handed off to Sean Montgomery with a 49.2 effort,
Bentley had closed to within 3 meters. Sean went out unusually hard
for him and brought the first lap home in 23.6. From there it was a
matter of not whether they would qualify provisionally, but could
they qualify automatically for Nationals. Sean brought the baton home
with a 49.6 in first place for the section, and 6th overall, with an
automatically qualifying time of 3:18.40.</P>

<P>Next week, the 5K runners and the 1600 team will travel up river
to Harvard to run in the prestigious IC4A Championship.</P>
