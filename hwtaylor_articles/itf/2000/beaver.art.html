Pentathlon</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>January 8, 2000</P>

<P>While the MIT Men's Track and Field team continues to recover from
the rash of preseason injuries, those who are healthy, and those who
have returned to action, displayed a solid competitive effort in the
Beaver Relays. MIT's annual post Christmas break invitational
attracted teams from Coast Guard, Fitchburg State, Tufts, and
Worcester State.</P>

<P>There is no score kept in this meet, but MIT won six of the
fifteen open events, and three of the four relays. The two strongest
events were the Pentathlon, and the Triple Jump where the Engineers
swept the first three places in both. Freshman Rick Rajter led the
way in the Pentathlon with 3266 points, setting a freshman record by
over 200 points. Rick said he will probably only hold the record
until second place finisher and teammate, freshman Craig Mielcarz,
recovers from his bout with the flu. Craig, who scored 2942 points,
had been sick with a stomach flu for the past three days, only coming
in to compete in order to get a qualifying mark in the Pentathlon.
Later in the day, Rajter (42-4 3/4) combined with Kalpak Kothari '01
(42-5 3/4), and Robbie Gray '02 (41-1 1/2), to sweep the Triple
Jump.</P>

<P>Mielcarz and Rajter also figured in another victory, the Shuttle
Hurdle Relay. A seldom run event, the SHR requires the four hurdlers
to run in alternating lanes, back and forth, with a 4 foot exchange
zone at each end. Peter Bluvas '01, fifth in the pentathlon with 2808
points, and second in the Weight Throw, ran second leg, and Junius Ho
'01, who also placed second in the 55HH in 8.27, ran anchor to win
the relay in 33.85 for an average of 8.45.</P>

<P>The final outstanding individual achievement was produced by Dan
Feldman '02, in the 3000. In a race loaded with no less than four
national level distance runners, Feldman took charge with a little
over 1000 meters to go. Opening up a 20 meter lead, Feldman was not
challenged until the final lap, when Dave Patterson of Tufts, an All
American in the Steeplechase, made a serious challenge. Feldman was
not to be denied as he showed an equally vicious kick to win the race
in 8:46.55. This performance was only off of roadwork as the Tech
distance runners won't be on the track for a few more weeks.</P>

<P>Being a relay meet, the field events were scored as relay events,
combining the top three performances from the same team to come up
with a cumulative score. In addition to the before mentioned Triple
Jump, MIT also won the Pole Vault with fine performances from Dan
Opila '03, Dan Kwon '02, and Steve Lefkowitz '00. The Long Jumpers
won their event as well with Gray, Kothari, and Ho doing the
honors.</P>

<P>Next week, MIT travels to Lewiston, Maine to compete against
Westfield State, Rhode Island College, University of Southern Maine,
and host, Bates College.</P>
