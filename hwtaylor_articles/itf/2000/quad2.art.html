<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Convincing Win in Quad Cup II Brings Tech to
7-0</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">January 22, 2000</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">MIT Men's Track and Field team scored an easy
victory in the second Quad Cup series with 225 points against Bowdoin
College (158), Springfield College (128), University of Southern
Maine (77), and WPI (9)to move to seven wins and zero
defeats.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Quad Cup is a 4 week series of meets among 16
Division III Colleges, a couple of Division II Colleges, as well as
Colleges outside of New England who can add quality to the meet. The
4 team per meet format, while being the original intent, is attempted
but not necessarily followed. Eight places score per non-relay event,
with the scoring varying minimally, 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Each team is
permitted 4 entries per event. Therefore, the maximum any team can
score in one event is 27 points.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">With this meet being the only potential easy
victory for MIT this season, the home team wanted to try and get
everyone on the team into an event, a feat that cannot be done in
most meets. In order to not deviate from this attempt it was
necessary for MIT to outscore it's opponents in the jumps by a large
margin. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Engineers more than came through, as they
finished the Long Jump, Triple Jump, High Jump, and Pole Vault with a
60 point lead over Springfield and 72 over Bowdoin. Highlited in
these events were season bests by Rick Rajter '03, Robbie Gray '02,
and Brian Hoying '03, in the Long Jump; a near sweep in the Triple
Jump with Gray, and Junius Ho '01, providing the season bests; a
continued 1-2 finish by Craig Mielcarz '03, and Hoying in the High
Jump, and a new PR by Steve Lefkowitz '00, in the Pole
Vault.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The woes continued in the throwing events as Tech
managed 0 points in both the Weight Throw and Shot Put. In part, this
is due to a lack of throwers as MIT only has one weight thrower and
shot putter, and he is the New England Division III runner-up in both
the Pentathlon and Decathlon, which of course keeps him very
busy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The running events saw the return to good
competition by many who had been injured during the pre-season. The
added depth showed as MIT outscored their opponents in every event
from the 400 - 3000 with the exception of the 600 where Tech scored 1
less than Bowdoin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Tech's hurdlers led the way with a 2-3-4 finish by
Ho (8.19), Rajter (8.19), and Bluvas (8.33). Yuval Mazor '02, had a
spectacular run in the 600, narrowly missing the MIT record in the
event by .15 seconds in 1:24.74. John Biesiadecki '01, ran his best
time in the 800 by three seconds with a 2:00.73, leading his team's
four places to 16 points. Sean Montgomery '01, and Dan Feldman '02,
took care of business in the 1500 by finishing 1-2 as usual. Todd
Rosenfield '01, led the 400 runners to a 2-3-4 finish with a 52.04
time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Next week, Tech travels to the Coast Guard Academy
to compete against Westfield State, WPI, and a rematch with
Bates.</FONT></P>
