            <h3 style="font-size: 12px">Williams Sets MIT Record, Setting the Tone For Outstanding Team Performances</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 12px">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">January 27, 2018</p>
            <p align="left">In the first of three weekends where MIT's Track &amp; Field team will split their squad between two venues, those seeking fast oval times participated in the <a href="terrier.res.php">Boston University
            John Thomas Terrier Invitational</a>, with the women competing on Friday and the men on Saturday on what is arguably the fastest indoor track in the country.&nbsp; Those competing in the field events, sprints and hurdles competed at Tufts University in the <a href="tuftsinvite.res.php">Branwen King-Smith Invitational</a>.</p>
            <p align="left">The 800 runners got things going for MIT.&nbsp; Bailey Tregoning&nbsp;'19, in her first race this year, tested the waters cautiously especially since the entire field, with the exception of Tregoning, was sub 32 at the 200.&nbsp; She gradually moved up in the race, looking comfortable the entire way as she finished in a solid 2:16.13.&nbsp; Margaret Trautner '20, in her second meet of the year and first 800 was also running with caution in her section as she went out in 33 high and 68 for the first two laps.&nbsp; In the final 400 she moved up, but waited a little too long to pull out a section victory.&nbsp; However, she did run an excellent 2:17.28.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 400 Hannah Chen '18 ran her first banked track 400 of the year.&nbsp; The senior got out well, splitting 27.7 for the opening 200.&nbsp; In the second lap she raced well, finishing in 57.53, easily her best race of the season.</p>
            <p align="left">Katie Williams '21, having run a 2:59 1000 on a flat track at Bates College, was ready to test her skills on the banked track.&nbsp; Sitting in the very back of the pack she still came through the first 200 in 32.9.&nbsp; As things settled the pace became more realistic.&nbsp; After splitting 2:21 for 800 meters the freshman went after the field, nearly reeling them all in as she set a personal record of 2:54.97, which was also a new MIT Freshman and Varsity record.</p>
            <p align="left">Michelle Menkiti '20 joined Chen in the 200.&nbsp; Menkiti was given lane five, which would make the turns much easier&nbsp;and she took advantage of it, running 25.55, her personal best indoors.&nbsp; Chen did not fair so well, getting lane&nbsp;1, a death sentence in the 200.&nbsp; Nevertheless she matched her time of 26.37 from last week.</p>
            <p align="left">The Engineers entered the distance events in the evening, having two entries in the 3K and two in the 5K.&nbsp; All four were placed in sections a little too fast for what they were prepared to run.&nbsp; Melissa McPhillips '20 was first up for Tech.&nbsp; Wanting to run 77-78 pace per 400, even at the back of her section she ran 74 at the 400 and 2:31 at the 800.&nbsp; She looked strong at 5:07 for 1600, but then she was unable to run faster than 81-82 pace the rest of the way as the early fast pace made her pay.&nbsp; McPhillips finished in 9:53.07, but it was clear that a more reasonable pace early on would help her secure  a low 9:40 performance.&nbsp; Emily Niu '21, also in the back of her section, was right on pace for what she wanted, splitting 81 and 2:42, but then it seemed she forgot to race.&nbsp; Nevertheless the freshman was still in good shape with a 5:30 1600 split, but then she slowed significantly, falling off the back to finish in 10:44.71.</p>
            <p align="left">Megan McCandless '20, in her first 5K of the season, was also in a section a little over her head currently.&nbsp; Wanting to run 83 pace, even 10 meters off the back of the pack she ran 81 for the first 400.&nbsp; At the 1600, still well off&nbsp;the back, she was comfortable in 5:28&nbsp;and ran 83's through the next 1200 meters before falling off to 86 as she hit 11:03 for 3200 meters.&nbsp; The final 1800 she gradually slowed from 86 to 88 pace, finishing in 17:37.90.&nbsp; The sophomore is returning well from injury, improving quickly in the young season.&nbsp; Jenna Melanson '20, an All American in the Steeplechase outdoors in her freshman year, was also taking on her first 5K of the season.&nbsp; She was hoping to run 84's, but again, the section was a little fast, plus she went out with some of the back runners, splitting 81 for the first 400.&nbsp; She got back on schedule very quickly and came through the 1600&nbsp;in 5:33.&nbsp; After 2400 meters Melanson started to lose contact when she looked and seemed perfectly comfortable and in contact with the back of the pack.&nbsp; She is certainly capable of this pace as her 10:43 Steeplechase proves.&nbsp; Her 3200 split&nbsp;was 11:18 and 4800 split a 15:52.&nbsp; Her 18:12.10 was a&nbsp;personal best, but she is capable of mid 17's at the very least.</p>
            <p align="left">On Saturday, the men started things off with Nathan Munet&nbsp;'19 in the 800.&nbsp; The junior got out well in the back of the pack.&nbsp; The entire race he was planning his moves too late, waiting until the turn to decide to move.&nbsp;&nbsp;Munet had to cut his momentum three different times on poorly planned passes.&nbsp; In the final 150 he moved well, passing most of the field to finish in a season best 1:56.04.</p>
            <p align="left">Benton Wilson '21 was running just his second indoor 400 ever, and his first on a banked track.&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in lane six, the freshman had no one to chase.&nbsp; Being cautious by nature, his first 200 was too slow, as three passed him on the second turn.&nbsp; Wilson split 24.5 moving into fourth at the break.&nbsp; Even in  the final lap he waited too long to move, finishing pretty fresh in 50.24.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 1000&nbsp;Meter Run, Simon Alford '20 was supposed to settle in the back and look for his opportunities to move up.&nbsp; Being the second fastest section the pace was bound to be fast.&nbsp; Instead the sophomore blasted out in the first 150 before settling in, but some damage was done as he still split 28.9.&nbsp; For some reason he was not content to sit and let things develop, instead moving in and out of lane one as he looked for openings to move up.&nbsp; After exchanging places in the back a&nbsp;couple of times and spending a significant amount of time in lane two, Alford unleashed an exceptional final 200 to run 2:28.77, tenth on MIT all-time list.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 200, Tre Albritten '18, coming off an illness, was certainly lacking some fitness, but his competitive attitude was solid.&nbsp; Albritten ran 22.08 in the 200.&nbsp; A few sections later, Wilson was back from the 400, finishing in 22.15.</p>
            <p align="left">Two freshmen, Dylan Doblar&nbsp;and Kent Slaney were up in the Mile.&nbsp; Doblar was in the slower section&nbsp;and was one of the higher seeds, so he&nbsp;knew he had a shot at winning the section.&nbsp; The pace was quick initially as he split a 62 first 400 and was not near the lead.&nbsp; The pace slowed, as did Doblar, splitting 2:08 and 3:13 as he moved towards the front.&nbsp; With 200 to go he had moved into second and with 100 to go took the lead.&nbsp; The runner came back on him but Doblar held him off to win in 4:19.33.&nbsp; Slaney, sick the latter half of the week was still feeling the effects of his cold in the race.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of his section, even though it was a faster section, started much slower.&nbsp; Running a 64 Slaney was in fifth through the first 400.&nbsp; He reacted to too many moves, never seeming to be patient in letting the race play out.&nbsp; By the time the&nbsp;field moved, Slaney was out of it.&nbsp; He woke up to kick the final 150 to finish in 4:24.39.</p>
            <p align="left">The final event at BU for MIT was the 3K.&nbsp; Aidan Gilson&nbsp;'19, Dennis Maloney '19 and Alex Knapp '19 were all representing MIT.&nbsp; Gilson and Maloney were in the same section and Knapp in a slower one.&nbsp; The pace Gilson and Maloney were looking for was 66 per 400, while Knapp was looking to run 68's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Racing in a fast section certainly helped as running 66 was exactly what was happening at the back of the pack.&nbsp; Through 1600 meters Gilson was 4:23 and Maloney 4:24.&nbsp; As the pack separated and the back of the pack slowed, Gilson and Maloney moved up gradually.&nbsp; After 2000 meters&nbsp;it was clear that both Gilson and Maloney were tiring, but both were still competing well.&nbsp; Running 2:16 from 2000 to 2800 meters put a dent in their bid to qualify for nationals, but finishing in 32 gave them a chance.&nbsp; Gilson ran a personal best 8:17.03 and Maloney an 8:18.44.&nbsp; Knapp fell into a similar pattern of running in the back and letting the pack do the work for him.&nbsp; He was not able to hold 68 flat pace, but was pretty close, coming through the 1600 at 4:35.&nbsp; He slowed slightly but held pace, never running slower than 70 second pace until the final lap.&nbsp; His final time of 8:41.13 was a personal best.</p>
            <p align="left">Meanwhile at Tufts, some pretty special performances were going on.&nbsp; Chris Washington '20 became the second MIT jumper to clear 6-8 in the High Jump this season, joining Alec Reduker '20, who accomplished the feat last week.</p>
            <p align="left">Jon Fakkema '19, improving weekly, threw 56-4 1/2 to claim second place in the Weight Throw.&nbsp; He also threw well in the Shot Put, throwing 47-0 3/4.&nbsp; Cody Bratten '18 and Albert Menio '20 also threw well, putting the shot 44-7 and 40-2 respectively.</p>
            <p align="left">Yorai Shaoul '21, out for the past month with a heel bruise, showed some of his talent as he only attempted three jumps in the Triple Jump and all of them were over 14 meters.&nbsp; His winning effort was 48-1 3/4.&nbsp; Jason Villanueva '19 also jumped a season best at 45-5.&nbsp; Ryan Prinster '18, also out for the past few weeks, jumped 44-5 1/2.</p>
            <p align="left">On the track&nbsp;Ellery Rajagopal '21 ran a flat track personal best of 1:26.96 in the 600 as he continues to improve.&nbsp; Ben Freed '18 ran a New England Division III qualifying time in the 5K with his 15:24.48 performance.</p>
            <p align="left">The Women's Long Jump was an exceptional event for MIT.&nbsp; Haley Strouf '18 jumped 18-3 1/4 to win with a season best.&nbsp; Tema Nwana '21, fresh off of her second concussion, jumped a personal best of 17-3 1/2.&nbsp; Also making solid jumps were Elizabeth Weeks '21, jumping 16-3 1/4 and Jasmine Jin '20&nbsp;at 16-2 1/4.</p>
            <p align="left">The Weight Throw was also a key event for Tech.&nbsp; Ari Slutsky '18 won the event with a throw of 54-1.&nbsp; Folusho Jebutu '20 threw a PR of 46-11 and Elise McCormack-Kuhman also threw a personal best of 39-6 1/2.</p>
            <p align="left">With only three weeks until the New England Division III Championships, MIT will continue to seek qualifying performances for those not qualified and fast section marks for those who have qualified.&nbsp; Some field event competitors will travel to the NEICAAA Championship at the Reggie Lewis track while most of the team will compete at the Tufts University Cupid Challenge next weekend.          </p>
