            <h3 style="font-size: 12px">MIT Brings Home 12 All America Awards<strong></strong>            </h3>
            <p align="left">March 10, 2018</p>
            <p align="left">As with most meets, the NCAA Division III Championship held at the Birmingham Crossplex in Birmingham, Alabama brought a mixture of excellent and disappointing performances and MIT had their share of both, although&nbsp;the majority were hard fought and competitive.&nbsp; When the dust had settled, the women finished in a tie for 11th place with 19 points and the men placed 18th with 12.5 points.</p>
            <p align="left">The weekend began on a high note with the Engineers earning two awards at the Coaches' and Athletes' Banquet.&nbsp; Coach Derek Rousseau was awarded the Men's New England Region Assistant Coach of the Year for his work with the jumping events, sending three men to Nationals and dominating the horizontal jumps in the New England Division III Championship.&nbsp; Aidan Gilson '19 earned&nbsp;the Elite 90 Award for the second year in a row.&nbsp; The Elite 90 Award goes to the male and female student-athlete with the highest GPA at each of the respective NCAA Championships.&nbsp; This is the ninth Elite 90 Award earned by the MIT Track &amp; Field / Cross Country program, which is more than any other Division III Institution has for all sports combined.&nbsp; A&nbsp;student-athlete can only win the award&nbsp;once in an academic year&nbsp;regardless how many sports in which the student-athlete participates.</p>
            <p align="left">Day one for MIT&nbsp;went reasonably well.&nbsp; All the men for Tech were competing on day two, so the first day for MIT was women only.&nbsp; The Pole Vault was the first event for the Engineers.&nbsp; Jacqueline Ahrens '21 started at the opening height of 11-3 3/4 even though she has a best of 12-11 1/2.&nbsp; She was clean at every height through 12-5 1/2, but then was shaken and could not get a solid attempt at 12-7 1/2, placing sixth.&nbsp; Kari Stromhaug '19&nbsp;also came in at the opening height.&nbsp; She missed once each at 12-3 1/2 and 12-5 1/2, but also went out at 12-7 1/2 even though she had very solid attempts where she just brushed the bar enough to dislodge it.&nbsp; She placed seventh, earning her third All American award.</p>
            <p align="left">Next up for MIT was the Women's Mile Run.&nbsp; Marissa McPhillips '20 elected to race both the Mile and the DMR, giving her three potential Mile or 1600 Meter races within 24 hours.&nbsp; In the trials,  the top three in each heat and the next four fastest times would move on to the finals.&nbsp; Racing in the second heat, McPhillips knew the first section had run fairly fast with the top four running 4:55 or faster.&nbsp; She put herself in the middle of the pack and although she reacted to moves a bit more than necessary, for the most part she stayed out of trouble.&nbsp; After a slow second quarter, splitting 2:32, the pace started picking up again.&nbsp; After a 3:46 three quarter mile split, McPhillips started pushing the pace, eventually taking the lead to win her heat in 4:57.45.</p>
            <p align="left">The Women's Long Jump and Weight Throw were starting at the same time . Haley Strouf '18 was in the first flight of the Long Jump and Nneoma Okonkwo '18 was in the second.&nbsp; Seeded 13th going into the competition, she knew she would probably have to win her flight to have a reasonable chance of making finals.&nbsp; The senior had three solid attempts, but could do no better than 17-8 1/4, which placed her 13th, matching her seed.&nbsp; Okonkwo, seeded seventh jumped well enough to make finals in seventh place.&nbsp; Jumping 18-4 1/4 on her final attempt to move back into seventh  after temporarily being bumped back to eighth.</p>
            <p align="left">Ariela Slutsky '18, seeded in a three-way tie for fifth based on her one great throw last weekend (57-9 1/2), was hoping to make finals.&nbsp; Both of her first two throws were 51-8 1/2.&nbsp; She fouled her third attempt, finishing in 13th place, missing finals.</p>
            <p align="left">Back to the track where MIT had two entries in the 800.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first section Katie Williams '21, the fourth seed had been racing better as the season progressed, owning freshman records in the 600, 800 and 1000 meter distances.&nbsp; However, the spotlight of the national championship had the freshman so worried that she squashed her adrenaline, making everything more challenging.&nbsp; Regardless, she put her best foot forward, running towards the front of the pace in a 33 opening 200.&nbsp; In the second 200 she let people go around her, gradually slipping towards the back as her 400 split slowed to 68.&nbsp; She eventually faded out the back, finishing last in 2:18.42. &nbsp;Even the best can be affected on the brightest stages.&nbsp; Margaret Trautner '20 was seeded 15th and in the second heat.&nbsp; With the top two from each heat and the next four fastest advancing to the final, making the final would mean All American assuming the completion of that final.&nbsp; Trautner raced as if she was supposed to be there and appeared totally unaffected by the national scene.&nbsp; She moved when necessary and slightly negative split her&nbsp;race, placing fourth in her heat in a new PR of 2:13.64, sixth overall in the field to make finals.</p>
            <p align="left">Mary Eccles '18 was up next in the 5K.&nbsp; The senior had made a few national championships in Cross Country, Indoor Track &amp; Field and Outdoor Track &amp; Field, but had never been All American.&nbsp; Seeded sixth going into the race she was more confident than ever and felt she could get the job done.&nbsp; The opening pace was insane at 35 seconds for the first 200.&nbsp; Most of the field was between 37 and 39 seconds with Eccles in the very back of the 17 competitors, also in 39.&nbsp; Staying in the back Eccles split 5:19 for the 1600 while the leaders were starting to break away at 5:15.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eccles slowly started moving up in the field, splitting 10:48 for 3200 meters, she was in seventh place, 11 seconds off the front and seven seconds down from sixth place.&nbsp; Eccles slowed to a 5:36 third 1600, but was closing fast on fifth and sixth place, who were paying for the early aggressive pace.&nbsp; In the final lap she could not make up the ground, finishing in seventh place in 17:04.46, two seconds back from fifth place, earning her first All America award.</p>
            <p align="left">The final race of day one was the Women's DMR.&nbsp; The foursome of Katie Bacher '20, Hannah Chen '18, Bailey Tregoning '19 and McPhillips was seeded eighth, but knew if they raced well they could place higher.&nbsp; Bacher led off with the 1200 leg.&nbsp; She put herself in the middle of the 12 team final, slowly moving up as she split 70 for the first quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a 36 third 200&nbsp;the sophomore moved towards the front, chasing after the leader from Otterbein College.&nbsp; Coming through 2:21 for the 800, Bacher separated herself from the main pack and was closing in on the leader.&nbsp; At&nbsp;the handoff to Chen, Bacher had gotten to within 10 meters of the lead with a phenomenal split of 3:32.7.&nbsp; Chen took the baton and did her job well.&nbsp; She split 26.8 and closed well to take the lead in 56.9.&nbsp; Bailey Tregoning '19 has an unfortunate habit of taking off too fast, particularly in relays.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with understanding that in this scenario she wanted to hit 33&nbsp;second pace for each 200, the junior again erred, running 29 for the first 200 and 62.0 for the 400.&nbsp; She managed a 35 third 200 as the field started closing down on the 50 meter lead she had developed.&nbsp; The final 200 was painful to watch, although she managed to split 2:17.8, handing off in second place.&nbsp; McPhillips went with the leader from WashU, but was quickly passed by Sarah Kelley '18 from Bowdoin.&nbsp; McPhillips had no choice but to go with Kelley&nbsp;who was laying down a torrid pace.&nbsp; After splitting 71 and 2:23, the duo had totally separated from the rest of the field.&nbsp; McPhillips was gapped just slightly after splitting 3:37 for 1200 meters, but was still in striking distance with 200 to go.&nbsp; That is when the wheels started to fall off the bus, particularly in the final 50.&nbsp; Kelley split 4:47 to carry Bowdoin to the win, and McPhillips still split a remarkable 4:55, but was passed by two teams right at the finish to earn fourth place, well ahead of their seed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their total time was 11:43.54.&nbsp; At the end of the first day the women were in fourth place with 14 points.</p>
            <p align="left">The Men's Triple Jump was the first event on day two and MIT had two jumpers, Yorai Shaoul&nbsp;'21 seeded third and Billy Ruschel '18 seeded ninth.&nbsp; With only 15 jumpers they&nbsp;went with one flight.&nbsp; Shaoul had an excellent series in the trials, starting off with a season best, improving each round, putting himself into second with a jump of 50-01 1/4 for a new PR and MIT record, one centimeter out of first place.&nbsp; Ruschel jumped a personal best of 48-9 on his second attempt to move him into third place in the trials.&nbsp; In the finals&nbsp;Shaoul fouled twice and then did not improve his mark on his final attempt.&nbsp; Ruschel was passed twice in the final round and could not improve his mark.&nbsp; Shaoul earning second and Ruschel fifth giving the men a nice 12 point start.</p>
            <p align="left">McPhillips was back for the Mile Run finals.&nbsp; She positioned herself well&nbsp;as the entire field went out fast.&nbsp; A lead pack of three were out in 70 and the trail pack that included McPhillips went out in 72.&nbsp; Due to the oxygen debt incurred the night before McPhillips would not likely survive a fast pace.&nbsp; Miraculously, the trail pack conceded to the leaders and slowed to 2:31.&nbsp; After another slow lap McPhillips moved towards the front of the trail pack and started pushing the pace.&nbsp; She dropped a 70 final quarter to finish in fifth in 4:58.76.</p>
            <p align="left">Margaret Trautner was hoping to do similar damage in the 800.&nbsp;&nbsp;With Emily Richards '18 from Ohio Northern winning the Mile and returning to the 800 final as the favorite&nbsp;with the 3K yet to come it was suspected the 800 would also be strategic.&nbsp; Like the Mile final earlier, Richards took the pace out.&nbsp; Trautner was in excellent position&nbsp;at the 200, but started falling back towards the end of the 400&nbsp;where she split 65.&nbsp; She did not believe in herself and gradually fell off the back, exactly the opposite of how she reacted in the trials.&nbsp; Nevertheless, she earned All American with her 2:17.47 eighth place finish.</p>
            <p align="left">Alec Reduker '20 was the fifteenth and final seed in the High Jump.&nbsp; Despite an inconsistent approach the sophomore cleared 6-3 1/2 and 6-5 1/2 on first attempts.&nbsp;He then cleared 6-7 1/2 on his second attempt.&nbsp; Clearing 6-9 on his third attempt gave him a tie for eighth place and his first All America&nbsp;award.</p>
            <p align="left">The final competitor for Tech was Aidan Gilson '19 in the 3K.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilson was primed and prepared to own the 3K despite his 10th place seed.&nbsp; The junior was a higher seed in the Mile, but felt more confident in the 3K, so focused on that event.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilson positioned himself well, sitting right off of the lead through a pretty casual 4:31 first 1600.&nbsp; Continuing with 67 pace Gilson started looking as if he doubted himself.&nbsp; Somewhere along the way, the mental doubts overcame the physical ability and he went out the back in the final 600 meters, finishing in 8:29.69.</p>
            <p align="left">The women finished in a tie for 11th place with 19 points and the men placed 18th with 12.5 points.&nbsp; A total of nine All America awards for the women and three for the men was an impressive finish for a total of 16 athletes.&nbsp; Overall, a successful outing for the Engineers.</p>
