            <p align="left">February 17, 2018</p>
            <p align="left">The dictionary defines failure as a lack of success, the omission of expected action.&nbsp; There is a prevailing thought that failure is a temporary state for those who strive for success; an opportunity to&nbsp;reflect on what went well and what needs to be corrected, and then moving on.&nbsp; For many,&nbsp;indeed, most successful individuals, failure is embraced as an obvious step in the process to be successful, whether that is in athletic competition or in life.&nbsp; However, for some, more than one might think, failure constitutes a paralyzing fear.&nbsp; Some even try to prove to themselves why they will fail, focusing on reasons why they will fail even when logic dictates they should succeed.&nbsp; Failure is safe.&nbsp; One does not have to put forth a maximum effort because failure is expected&nbsp;and accepted.</p>
            <p align="left">The MIT Men's and Women's Track &amp; Field teams  lost their respective New England Division III (NED3) Championships yesterday; the women finishing second to Williams College in a meet predicted to be a toss up between the two rivals, and the men were runners-up to Tufts University&nbsp;after being  favored to win.&nbsp; Williams and Tufts competed better, wanted it more and focused on what they needed to do rather than what they could not do.</p>
            <p align="left">Both MIT teams, despite some truly amazing performances, found enough ways to fail to allow the championship to slip through their fingers.&nbsp; Coach Halston Taylor failed to prepare his teams to get past the fear of failure, failed to motivate those who found it easier to not fight for every position and every point, failed to get those who focus on what is going on&nbsp;in their head to instead focus on the competition, and even in at least one case, failed to provide the proper race strategy.&nbsp; With that said, the outstanding performances by many of the Engineers nearly overcame it all.</p>
            <p align="left">The women had won three consecutive NED3 titles and the men, while losing last year, also to Tufts, had won the previous three years.&nbsp; The women's competition was held at Springfield College.&nbsp; The night before Williams College dominated the Pentathlon, scoring 22 points, one less than expected.&nbsp; MIT knew they would have to counter early in the meet because Williams was favored to score 24 in the High Jump.&nbsp;&nbsp;MIT did indeed counter, and did so&nbsp;in a slightly unexpected way.&nbsp; MIT was seeded to score 14 points in the Long Jump to 13 for Williams.&nbsp; Haley Strouf '18 and Nneoma Okonkwo '18&nbsp;placed first and second respectively with&nbsp;season bests of 18-6 1/2 and 18-5 3/4 for 18 points.&nbsp; Williams still scored 12 points, but that was a five point swing for MIT.</p>
            <p align="left">Williams did indeed place 1-2-3 in the High Jump.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Engineers lost a point when Margaret Redfield '21 finished in a three-way tie for fifth with a jump of 5-3 instead of securing sole possession of fifth place.</p>
            <p align="left">Back on the positive side, Jacqueline Ahrens '21 continued to amaze as she won the Pole Vault competition with yet another MIT freshman record, and tied the NED3 record of 12-11 1/2 owned by her coach, Cimmy Virdi.&nbsp; Teammates Kari Stromhaug '19 (12-9 1/2) and Makenzie Patarino '19 (11-7 3/4) placed second and sixth for a total of 21 points, one more than they were seeded&nbsp;while Williams took one less than their seed.</p>
            <p align="left">On the track&nbsp;the Distance Medley Relay and 5K, the two first finals of the day, were supposed to be big for MIT.&nbsp; In the DMR, Margaret Trautner '20 opened up with a 3:40 in the 1200 leg to give MIT a nice lead.&nbsp; Kristen Frombach '19 held that lead with a season best 60.7 for the 400 leg.&nbsp; Bailey Tregoning '19 cruised to a 2:18 800, expanding the lead to handoff to Katie Bacher '20 for the 1600 anchor.&nbsp; Bacher ran relaxed through an even paced 3:46 1200, before shutting it down in the final quarter to run a 5:05, giving MIT a four second victory over second place Williams, which gave the Ephs four points more than they were seeded to get.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 5K, Talia Ruxin '20 from Middlebury took out the pace ridiculously fast at 38 seconds for the first 200.&nbsp; Mary Eccles '18 went right with her with Megan McCandless '20 just a few meters behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;MIT was seeded for 17 points with Eccles winning, McCandless for third and Jenna Melanson '20 seeded eighth.&nbsp; Williams was seeded for 10.&nbsp; Ruxin continued to push the pace through the first mile although not at sub 80 pace.&nbsp; Eccles passed the 1600 at 5:26 and looked great.&nbsp; McCandless passed through in 5:33 and was looking gassed.&nbsp; Melanson had started at 85 pace and was reaping the benefits as she was moving up well in the field.&nbsp; At 2K the pace slowed to 84, which was the magic number for Eccles, so she moved into&nbsp;the lead, not only to stay on NCAA qualifying pace, but threw down a 79 to eliminate Ruxin&nbsp;from contention.&nbsp; McCandless started falling out of the back while Melanson continued to move up, now in fifth.&nbsp; The 3200 was 10:51 for Eccles and 11:30 for Melanson while McCandless dropped to a 5:58 second 1600, now one second behind Melanson.&nbsp; Two Williams runners were coming up on Melanson and as soon as they caught her Melanson dropped to 88 second pace, eventually falling out of the scoring.&nbsp; Eccles continued to hammer away, only slowing slightly to a 5:30 third 1600 to finish in a personal best 17:02.65, moving&nbsp;into the top five performances in the country for Division III.&nbsp; The bottom line from a team perspective is that MIT lost seven expected points and Williams gained one.</p>
            <p align="left">The Triple Jump was a big positive for Tech.&nbsp; Jasmine Jin '20 jumped 37-5 on her second attempt to move into second place.&nbsp; Elizabeth Weeks '21 jumped 36-1 1/4 to make finals and then jumped a season best 36-10 1/4 on her final attempt to move into fifth place.&nbsp;MIT's 12 points were seven more than expected and Williams only secured one point when they were seeded for eight.&nbsp; Overall this was a 14 point&nbsp;swing, one which MIT needed desperately.</p>
            <p align="left">Ariela Slutsky '18 seeded second in the Weight Throw only managed third even though she threw 54-10 3/4.&nbsp; Not able to throw or practice the Shot Put&nbsp;for weeks due to a thumb injury, the senior gave it her best effort but was unable to score in that event.</p>
            <p align="left">The Mile was the next big race for MIT on the track.&nbsp; Marissa McPhillips '21 represented MIT as the second seed&nbsp;at 4:58.&nbsp; The pace was crisp as McPhillips positioned herself well with splits of 74, 2:27 and 3:40 before trying to move into first.&nbsp; She was able to move around to second, but could not close the ground on first&nbsp;as she took second in a personal best of 4:55.42.</p>
            <p align="left">Hannah Chen '18, hoping to make the finals in the 60HH was unable to do so despite her 9.23 effort.&nbsp; In the 400, seeded second, Chen got left behind in the first 200.&nbsp; She tried to make up the difference in the second lap but was unable to catch anyone, finishing fifth in 58.68.</p>
            <p align="left">Katie Williams '21 would have been the top seed in the 1000, but already having the top three seeds, Coach Taylor elected to put Williams in the 600, thinking she could steal some points&nbsp;by placing higher than her fifth seed.&nbsp; The freshman got out well in a high 31,&nbsp;although in the back of the pack.&nbsp; Knowing the front runners went out too fast Williams should have moved up easily to position herself for the win.&nbsp; However, she ran tight did not plan her moves well and had to move out to lane three in the final straight.&nbsp; Regardless, she earned her fifth place and set an MIT freshman record of 1:38.51 in the process.</p>
            <p align="left">Tregoning, seeded fourth, returned in the 800 to see if she could defend her title from last year.&nbsp; An early season injury had kept Tregoning from gaining the necessary base and has forced her to try to catch up in the late season.&nbsp; She positioned herself well, although she lost momentum twice due to a lot of contact by others in the race.&nbsp; In the final 400 she could only manage a 71, placing fourth in 2:18.89.</p>
            <p align="left">As mentioned, MIT was seeded for 24 points in&nbsp;the 1000, with all three runners returning from either the DMR or Mile.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the field was so big with 11 runners, the correct strategy would have been for the heavy favorites to take the lead and push the pace, making for less contact and saving energy by not having to move up through the field.&nbsp; Instead Coach Taylor thought others doing the work would benefit MIT as long as the pace did not slow to 37 200's&nbsp;without MIT taking the lead and pulling away.&nbsp; Well, the pace started at 37 and MIT was unable to get to the front.&nbsp; Finally, Bacher was able to move to the front with 300 to go and pulled away for victory in 2:59.04.&nbsp; McPhillips, looking a bit gassed, still managed a 2:30.57 for fourth place, but Trautner, went out the back in 3:05.93.&nbsp; The nine point loss was devastating to the team's hopes of winning the championship.</p>
            <p align="left">Although Michelle Menkiti '20 ran 26.28 for sixth place in the 200, she had to do so out of lane four.&nbsp; Success in the 200 is largely a factor of which lane you receive, with lane six being the preferred lane due to less forces applied to the legs and running less of the first turn.&nbsp; Chen had even less luck as she drew lane three, preventing her from placing.&nbsp; Scoring three points when seeded for nine pretty much sealed MIT's fate.</p>
            <p align="left">The only hope remaining to get MIT close was the 3K.&nbsp; MIT was coming back with their 5K runners and a fresh Bailee Margolis '19.&nbsp; Eccles, knowing her legs would be heavy for the first mile, eased into the race, moving from the back, gradually sliding up to fourth place in a personal best 10:14.40.&nbsp; Melanson rebounded nicely to take sixth in 10:29.45.&nbsp; This gave MIT a slim chance as they were now only four points down to Williams&nbsp;with the 4x400 and 4x800 remaining.</p>
            <p align="left">The Engineers did not have a 4x400 to speak of, but were putting together the best team they could.&nbsp; MIT felt sure they could win the 4x800, but also were sure that Williams would place right behind them.&nbsp; They had to hope for a dropped baton or something similar in order to pull out the victory.&nbsp; However, despite a valiant effort, the quartet of Chen, Frombach, Skylar Brooks '20 and Tregoning were not able to score with a 4:06.19 while Williams earned second place to pull out to a 12 point lead.</p>
            <p align="left">With the meet mathematically over, MIT scratched the 4x800 to start saving the legs for Nationals.&nbsp; Having not lost a New England Division III title in Cross Country, Indoor or Outdoor Track and Field since the Fall of 2015, it will be interesting to see if the Engineers can bounce back.&nbsp; Is failure truly a temporary state?&nbsp; We will find out in less than three months when MIT hosts the Outdoor NED3 Championship.</p>
            <p align="left">MIT&nbsp;entered the men's meet as  favorites.&nbsp; Even if you consider the relays are at the end of the meet with everyone pretty fatigued, meaning MIT's number one seed in the DMR and 4x800 may fall short, still would put Tech as slight favorites over Tufts.&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">In the first events, the Long Jump and Weight Throw, things were going according to plan.&nbsp;  Jon Fakkema '19 lost one expected point even though he came within a quarter of an inch of his personal best with a fifth place throw of 56-4.&nbsp; The jumpers then made up four points by scoring 12 when seeded for only eight.&nbsp;Mac Gregg '21 earned second place with a jump of 21-9 1/2 and Yorai Shaoul '21 placed fifth with a jump of 21-4 1/4.&nbsp; For some reason no one was jumping very far in the Long Jump event.&nbsp;MIT was up on Tufts 16 to 2.</p>
            <p align="left">With the conclusion of the Heptathlon, Tufts managed to score seven points while MIT had no&nbsp;entries.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 60HH trials, Chris Sweeney '18, seeded second, had been sick with either the stomach bug or food poisoning and was still feeling the effects.&nbsp; This affected him physically and mentally, which resulted in not qualifying for the finals, a loss of eight big points&nbsp;and the loss of a second leg of the 4x400 relay in as many days.&nbsp;&nbsp;The day before, Tre&nbsp;Albritten '18 a number two seed in the 200 and a sub 50 relay leg was scratched due to an upper respiratory infection.&nbsp; In addition, Tufts won the event after only being expected to place third.&nbsp; The 12 point swing more than wiped out the earlier gain and seemed to affect some of the MIT team.&nbsp; The score was now 19 to 16 in Tufts favor.</p>
            <p align="left">In the first running final, the Mile run, MIT was represented by the number one seed, Aidan Gilson '19.&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought was that this would be a strategic race since it was such a loaded field and no one was likely willing to expose themselves.&nbsp; Gilson put himself in a pretty good position, but off of a 3:13.5 1200 split was jumped by Springfield's Jack Pinho '18 and could not close the gap, earning second in 4:14.80.&nbsp; MIT lost two expected points, but Tufts lost three--score 24 to 19.</p>
            <p align="left">The High Jump was potentially a big event for MIT as they were represented by three entries, with Chris Washington '20 seeded to place fourth.&nbsp; Tufts placed second in the event for eight points and Washington failed to score.&nbsp; Tufts was now up by three.</p>
            <p align="left">MIT had no entries in the 400 or 600, which is  difficult to believe given their rich history in those events.&nbsp; Tufts, seeded for 15 in the 600, pulled out 17, making the score Tufts 44, MIT 24.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 60, Tufts was seeded for five points, but earned six.&nbsp; Likewise, in the Shot Put, while Cody Bratten '18 threw an indoor best of 46-3 1/2 to steal two points, Tufts placed third, a three point gain over their seed.&nbsp; Tufts was now ahead by 30.</p>
            <p align="left">Simon Alford '20 came through big for the Engineers.&nbsp; The number one seed in the 1000 did just that, placing first with a well run 2:30.20 come from behind victory.&nbsp; Nathan Munet '19 was unable to score in the 800, but was not seeded to do so.&nbsp; He did place ninth in 1:56.60, perhaps waiting a little too long to make his move.&nbsp; Tufts was seeded for 22 points in&nbsp;the two events, but managed 18, putting MIT down by 38, 74 to 36.</p>
            <p align="left">The remaining field events, the Triple Jump and Pole Vault were supposed to be big MIT events, seeded for 19 in the TJ and 12 in the PV while Tufts was seeded for eight points.&nbsp; Tufts got their eight in the Pole Vault but MIT did not get their 12.&nbsp; Liam Ackerman '21 more than came through, clearing a PR of 15-1 1/2 for fourth place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby Upton '20 had his best meet of the season, clearing 14-9 1/2 to place seventh.&nbsp; Scott Cameron '19, the defending champion and Raja Rajcic '20, both expected to score, both cleared 14-3 1/2 but were unable to place.&nbsp; The Triple Jump was the premiere event for MIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaoul took the lead on his first jump, and proceeded to jump an MIT best 48-7 1/4 to win the event and improve his freshman record.&nbsp; Billy Ruschel '18, seeded second in the event, nearly fouled out after missing his first two jumps, but then leaped into second place on his third attempt, eventually jumping 47-7.&nbsp; Ryan Prinster '18 jumped over 46' for the second week in succession, placing fourth with a 46-3 1/2 performance.&nbsp; The 23 points exceeded their expectation, but Tufts was still up 82 to 66.</p>
            <p align="left">Benton Wilson '21 placed second in the 200 with a 22.33 effort, an&nbsp;excellent flat track performance.&nbsp; Tufts  scored 13, placing first and sixth, stretching their lead 95 to 74</p>
            <p align="left">The distance events and relays were all that was left&nbsp;and MIT was seeded to do well&nbsp;so there was still a chance, but not a good one.&nbsp; Gilson was again seeded first in the 3K, but although he was having an amazing season, he was not accustomed to doubling in such a meet and profiled as the top runner.&nbsp; Apparently he did not believe he could win because once the pace picked up after the Mile it was obvious he was not owning the race.&nbsp; Billy Woltz '20, also capable of placing high,  is not capable of just racing and going for the win,&nbsp;and did not prepare himself mentally for what he needed to do.&nbsp; Gilson earned seventh and Woltz eighth to give MIT three points.&nbsp; Josh Rosenkranz&nbsp;'19 and David Walter '18 raced well in the 5K and either was capable of winning, but neither made the move that could have gotten the job done.&nbsp; They did earn second and fourth, running 15:06.28 and 15:10.10 in&nbsp;a sit and kick race.&nbsp; Tufts scored in neither race making the score 95 to 90.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">The DMR was first among the relays and MIT had  three fourths of their squad totally fresh.&nbsp;Dylan Doblar '21, having run a 4:19 mile earlier in the season was the 1200 leg.&nbsp; He did not appear to race it like a time trial but more like an actual race.&nbsp; There appeared to be no confidence or ownership as he lost places and time, finishing in 3:12.&nbsp; The handoff went very poorly between Doblar and Ken Acquah '20, which lost more time.&nbsp; Acquah panicked and went out too hard trying to make up the difference.&nbsp; Although he split a 25 first 200 he finished in 55.&nbsp; Brian Bates '20, coming back from a non-placing effort in the Mile, split a 2:02 800 leg after going out in 60 for the first 400.&nbsp; Kent Slaney '21 having run 4:19 last week at Boston University was ready to get the job done, but he was too far back.&nbsp; He caught the Tufts runner but the next four were between seven and 10 seconds in front even after a 4:21 leg.&nbsp; The 10:31.89 was good for fifth place, making up one point on Tufts who placed sixth.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 4x400 with too sub 50 legs out with illness, two brave and game jumpers took their place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregg, Washington, Wilson and Prinster ran 3:30.69 but could not score.&nbsp; Tufts earned four points with a fifth place finish for an eight point lead.</p>
            <p align="left">The 4x800 would have to win and hope Tufts did no better than seventh place in order to secure a tie. Munet led off and for some reason did not go out to give the team a lead, instead running just under 30 second pace when he should have been running 28's.&nbsp; His 1:58 leg was not the setup the unit needed.&nbsp; Ellery Rajagopal '21 ran a solid leg, but was supposed to get the baton far ahead.&nbsp; Instead he lost ground as the other teams caught up despite his 2:00.&nbsp; Gilson was definitely tired, but there was no one else available.&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave it his best but 2:00 was not good enough.&nbsp; Alford went our too hard, splitting 56 at the 400 and then faded badly to 2:00, giving the team a 7:59.72 for sixth place.&nbsp; Tufts placed second to seal the well deserved victory.&nbsp; The final score was Tufts 110, MIT 97.</p>
            <p align="left">From this point on for the Engineers it is all about the NCAA Division III Championship in three weeks.&nbsp; Currently, the women have a solid DMR, Eccles in the 5K, Ahrens and Stromhaug in the Pole Vault and possibly Strouf and Okonkwo in the Long Jump&nbsp;and Ariela Slutsky in the Weight Throw.&nbsp; The men have&nbsp;a pretty good shot at a DMR and Gilson in the Mile and 3K along with Shaoul and Ruschel in the Triple Jump.</p>
