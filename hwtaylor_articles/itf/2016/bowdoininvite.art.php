            <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 16px">Gong and Rosenkranz Shine in 3K</span></p>
            <p align="left">January 23, 2016</p>
            <p align="left">Figuring the outcome of the <a href="bowdoininvite.res.php">10 team track &amp; field invitational at Bowdoin&nbsp;College</a> based on coaches' entries was baffling at best.&nbsp; On paper, MIT was favored by ~30 points on the men's side and ~40 points on the women's tally.&nbsp; The combination of MIT student-athletes exceeding prior performances and expectations and many teams not matching their coach's predications led to a route in favor of MIT.&nbsp; The women more than doubled second place Merrimack&nbsp;College's point total 203 to 90.&nbsp; In the men's meet the Engineers scored 190 points, also more than doubling the score of second place  host Bowdoin College.&nbsp; In both meets Tufts University finished a respectable third place.&nbsp; There were only six scoring places per event&nbsp;using a scoring format of 10-8-6-4-2-1.</p>
            <p align="left">The spotlight event turned out to be the 3K.&nbsp; In the women's race, this was the opportunity Maryann Gong '17 was taking to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship.&nbsp; Wanting to qualify for Nationals in the Mile, 3K, 5K and DMR, she knew that this was&nbsp;likely to be her one shot and needed to make the most of it.&nbsp; At the gun Gong took off, opening up with a 76 opening 400, ultimately deciding the outcome of the race right there.&nbsp; Gong backed off very little, coming through the 1600 in 5:11&nbsp;and not slowing down from there, running 77's the rest of the way to finish in 9:41.34, lapping the field in the process.&nbsp; In the men's race, winner Josh Rosenkranz '19, needed some help, but used assistance to demolish the MIT freshman record, running 8:33.32.&nbsp; Tim Nichols '17 of Tufts and Matt Jacobson '17 of Bowdoin&nbsp;took over pacing duties after Rosenkranz went from an opening 400 in 68 to a second quarter in 70.&nbsp; From that point the pace gradually picked up to 69 pace for a 4:38 first mile and then picking up more with a 67 penultimate quarter.&nbsp; At this point, Rosenkranz brought the wood, dropping a 29 final 200 on the field to open up a nearly  10 meter lead at the finish.</p>
            <p align="left">In the women's meet there were many stars for Tech, serving up six all-time top 10 list bests&nbsp;and numerous personal and season bests.&nbsp; Hannah Chen '18 owned three of those top 10 marks, earning personal bests in the 60 Meter Dash, the 60&nbsp;Meter High Hurdles and the Long Jump.&nbsp; In the 60 and 60HH she earned personal bests in both the trials and finals to actually come through with five personal bests throughout the day.&nbsp; The sophomore star garnered 22 points for her team by placing second in both the 60HH (9.04) and 200 Meter Dash (25.93), taking fourth in the Long Jump (17-5 1/4) and fifth in the 60 (7.91).</p>
            <p align="left">Nneoma Okonkwo '18 also had two personal bests and all-time top 10 performances, running 7.94 in the 60 Meter Dash&nbsp;as she earned sixth place and jumping 17-7 1/2 to place second in the Long Jump.&nbsp; She also took third place honors in the 200.</p>
            <p align="left">Victories were plentiful for Tech at eight.&nbsp; Jackie Vahey '17 thew a personal best of 52-8 to win the Weight Throw.&nbsp; Natalie Alper&nbsp;'17, despite doing multiple events, tied her personal best of 5-3 3/4 to win the High Jump.&nbsp; Alper had an excellent attempt at 5-5 3/4.&nbsp; Cimmy Virdi '16 was not at her best due to shin splints, but was good enough to win the Pole Vault at 12-0.&nbsp; On the track, in addition to Gong's victory, Bailey Tregoning '19 easily took first place honors in the 800.&nbsp; Becoming impatient off of a pedestrian pace of 71.6&nbsp;at the 400 and 1:47 at the 600, Tregoning ran a 33 final 200 to win easily in 2:20.97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing the freshman theme, Megan Montgomery '19 won the Mile Run in 5:15.81.&nbsp; If some is good, more is better as Bailee Margolis '19 led her two freshman teammates to a 1-2-3 MIT freshmen finish in the 5K, running 18:46.55.&nbsp;&nbsp;MIT began the meet with a victory in the first event (5K) and they finished it with a victory in the final event, the 4x800 Relay.&nbsp; The quartet of Margolis, Gong, Clementine Mitchell '18 and Tregoning ran 9:41.94 to easily win the race.</p>
            <p align="left">The event of the meet for the women was the Pole Vault.&nbsp; In addition to Virdi's victory, MIT earned second, third and fifth place, with Sherry Wan '16 and Jen Tylock '17 clearing 11-5 3/4 and Makenzie Patarino '19 making 10-11 3/4.</p>
            <p align="left">The one multiple winner for the men was Michael Kaba '16.&nbsp;Kaba scored 26.5 points in&nbsp;winning the 60HH&nbsp;and 200, getting fourth in the 60 Meter Dash and running the leadoff leg on the victorious 4x400 Relay.&nbsp; Kaba ran season bests in both the 60HH and the 60 at 8.46 and 7.17 respectively.&nbsp; His 200 was in 22.61 and then he led off the 4x400 with a 49.9 opening leg to give his team the lead against the NCAA Division III 800 champion.</p>
            <p align="left">Overall the men won nine events.&nbsp; In addition to the two by Kaba and the record victory by Rosenkranz, there were plenty of impressive first place performances.&nbsp; Marshall Wentworth '16 cleared a PR of 14-7 1/4 to win the Pole Vault.&nbsp; Billy Ruschel '18 dominated the Triple Jump with a big 46-0 effort.&nbsp; States Lee '16 got the break in the 400 in 23.2 and continued uncontested to win in 49.85, his fastest ever 200 meter flat track performance.&nbsp; Another very impressive victory, and probably the event of the meet for the men was had in the Mile Run.&nbsp; After Colin Godwin '17 did most of the early leg work, leading the pace of 64 and 2:08 through 800 meters, Ben Bosworth '17 of Conn. College took the lead briefly before Aidan Gilson '19 took over the reigns and buried a 62 final 400 to win in 4:15.46.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunal Tangri '19 passed Godwin in the final 200 to place third in 4:17.48 to Godwin's fourth in 4:17.61.&nbsp; Rory Beyer '17 took the lead in the 5K from teammate Cooper Sloan '18 after the 1600 and never relinquished it as he ran 4:50, 4:48 and 4:54 1600 splits before closing in 34 seconds to run a PR of 15:06.33.&nbsp; Sloane held on for second place and Nicholas Waltman '18 fourth for MIT's highest scoring event on the men's side.&nbsp; In the 4x400 Relay it appeared MIT would have a race of it with Tufts University as Kaba maintained the smallest of leads through the handoff&nbsp;and Derek Barnes '16 barely held off their second leg as he ran 51.3.&nbsp; However, when Danny Newman '17 took the baton the competition faded&nbsp; badly.&nbsp; Newman's 51.1 leg gave MIT a substantial lead.&nbsp; States Lee took the baton and buried a 49.7 anchor to give the team a 4:22.20 season best.</p>
            <p align="left">Other significant personal and season bests by the men were spread throughout the team.&nbsp; The throwers competed well which accounted for their personal bests.&nbsp; Alex Noakes '16 threw 45-10 in the Weight Throw, earning fourth place and Cody Bratten '18 placed second in the Shot Put with a&nbsp;throw of 46-3 1/2.&nbsp; Chris Sweeney ran a personal best of 8.53 to lead qualifiers in the 60HH, but pulled his hamstring in the 60 Meter Dash trials so was unable to race in the final.&nbsp; Newman and Barnes placed fourth and fifth respectively in the 400 with a personal indoor best of 50.86 for Newman and a season best of 50.89 for Barnes.&nbsp; Gilson and Tangri teamed up again in the 1000 running 2:33.03 and 2:34.57 personal bests.&nbsp; Daniel Weiss '19 and Dennis Maloney '19 ran 8:48.62 and 8:50.91 in the 3K, both personal bests.</p>
            <p align="left">Next week, MIT will split their squad amongst three different meets.&nbsp; Boston University is hosting the John Thomas Terrier Classic that hosts the women on Friday and men on Saturday, which is where most of MIT's oval runners will be competing.&nbsp; MIT will be hosting the Art Farnham Invite on Saturday&nbsp;where those not taking the weekend off or competing at BU,  will be competing.&nbsp; The one exception to that will be three multi-event athletes who will be competing at the Tufts Multi on Friday and Saturday.&nbsp; None of the meets are scoring.</p>
