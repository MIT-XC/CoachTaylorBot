            <p style="font-size: 16px">Albritten Sets MIT 200 Record</p>
            <p align="left">February 12-13, 2016</p>
            <p align="left">For the most part, MIT Track &amp; Field used this weekend, the one prior to the New England Division III Championship, to rest and get ready for whatever is necessary to defend their New England Division III titles.&nbsp; For those who needed to compete MIT split their squads.&nbsp; On Friday, the women's runners and the men's Distance Medley Relay (DMR) ran at the <a href="valentine.res.php">David Hemery Valentine Invitational</a> at Boston University.&nbsp; On Saturday, the men's runners along with the men's DMR ran at BU.&nbsp; Those men and women in the field events and short sprints competed at <a href="gk.res.pdf">MIT's Gordon Kelly Invitational</a>, and Cimmy Virdi '16 competed on Sunday at the <a href="http://www.nbindoorgrandprix.com/meet-info/">New Balance Grand Prix meet at the Reggie Lewis Center</a>.</p>
            <p align="left">The Valentine meet kicked off with the men's DMR.&nbsp; MIT was taking their first, and hopefully last shot at qualifying for the NCAA&nbsp;Division III Championship, which would probably take a time just under 9:50.&nbsp; MIT was depending on three freshmen for the middle-distance legs so anything could happen.&nbsp; Kunal Tangri '19 led things off with the 1200 leg.&nbsp; Despite running a 2:30 1000 last week on a flat track, the freshman got in the back of a pack early on and struggled on the banked track.&nbsp;Tangri handed off to States Lee '16 at 3:07.&nbsp; When your team is at the back of the race, each leg tends to go out too fast in an effort to move up and this certainly happened to MIT.&nbsp; At this point the team had no chance at Nationals but they did not know that.&nbsp; Lee went out too fast for the first 200 (22.1), but still finished strong in 48.2.&nbsp; Jarod Wilson '19 took off for the 800 leg, also going out too fast, running 25.7 for the opening 200.&nbsp; Wilson competed well nevertheless, finishing in 1:52.6 and moving MIT up a few teams.&nbsp; The 1600 anchor leg was run by Aidan Gilson '19.&nbsp;He also went out too fast, running 60.2 for the opening 400 and was solid at 2:04 for the 800, but then the wheels started to fall off the bus.&nbsp; Regardless he held on well, closing in 4:15.3 to give MIT an overall time of 10:03.73.&nbsp; They may give it another try in two weeks, particularly if Colin Godwin '17 is ready to race.</p>
            <p align="left">Opening up the meet for the women was Bailey Tregoning '19 in the 800.&nbsp; Tregoning, still learning to compete at the collegiate level, got pulled out too fast (31.5) and then the entire pack put the breaks on, causing her to get jostled around a little.&nbsp; With a lap to go she took the lead but got caught in the final 50 to run 2:15.69.</p>
            <p align="left">Hannah Chen '18 and Kendra Knittel '17 both raced the 400 and 200 meter races.&nbsp; In the 400 Chen ran a season best despite running in lane two the entire second lap as she tried in vain to take the lead.&nbsp; Her 57.53&nbsp;may get her into next week's fast section.&nbsp; Knittel showed she is coming back nicely from her injury, running 59.98 leading&nbsp;start to finish for the section victory.&nbsp; In the 200 Chen drew lane two, but still ran close to her best with a 25.96.&nbsp; Knittel was in lane three and ran 26.86.</p>
            <p align="left">The final event for Tech on Friday was the Mile Run.&nbsp;Clemmie Mitchell '18 and Megan Montgomery '19 ran nearly identical times, but the race to get there could not have been more opposite.&nbsp; Mitchell raced first.&nbsp; She stayed on the rail, starting off in the back of the field, but moving up when there were opportunities on the inside.&nbsp; It seemed she was determined to run the least distance possible.&nbsp; Her first 400 was 77 seconds and from there she deviated very little as she ran 80, 79 and 77 to take second in her section in 5:13.19.&nbsp; Montgomery, not a very patient runner, took the lead late in the first 200 and hit the first 400 in 74.&nbsp; She proceeded to keep the lead, but slow to 77, then 80 and finally 82 as she was passed in the final 100 by two runners to run 5:13.30.</p>
            <p align="left">On Saturday, the women were back on the track for the DMR.&nbsp; The goal was to be the top DIII team and to go under 11:40.&nbsp; The quartet of Nicole Zeinstra '16, Hannah Chen '18, Bailey Tregoning '19 and Maryann Gong '17 were in the fast section&nbsp;with plenty of competition.&nbsp; Zeinstra led off in the 1200 leg.&nbsp; She positioned herself in the back, but even that was too quick as she came through the 400 in 71.&nbsp; The pace settled down&nbsp;as she came through the 800 in 2:24.&nbsp; At this point it looked as though she would take off, but the pace scared her even though she looked very comfortable.&nbsp; She&nbsp;was able to run a 3:40, which was her goal, but the team was in last place.&nbsp; Chen ran the 400 leg and moved up one team and closed on a couple others&nbsp;as she ran a 56.8.&nbsp;Tregoning, suffering pretty badly from a cold, did not let it affect her mentally.&nbsp; However, after a 31 opening 200 and 65 400, it was obvious the cold was having an effect.&nbsp; She struggled on the final lap, finishing in 2:16 but had passed two more teams.&nbsp; Gong received the baton with two Division III teams in front of her, Middlebury and Cortland State.&nbsp;She opened up with a 71, but slowed to 2:24 as no team was in sight.&nbsp; As she entered the third quarter she caught sight of another team and used this to stay focused.&nbsp; Her final split of 4:51.5 gave the team an 11:45.66 overall.&nbsp; They did not meet their time goal but they did finish as the top DIII team, and may have the top time in the country for DIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless, they have at least ten seconds in the tank if they race it again.</p>
            <p align="left">The first event for the MIT men was the 800.&nbsp; Jarod Wilson '19 was in an excellent section, one that would set him up for a great performance.&nbsp; The first lap was 25&nbsp;and the 400 54.1, but on that second lap it was obvious his head was not in the game as he allowed a gap in front of him to go unfilled, so others filled it for him, pushing him to the back of the pack.&nbsp; He checked out at this point, giving up and jogging in in 1:55.32, missing another great opportunity.&nbsp; Nathan Munet '19 ran a season and indoor best 1:56.95 and would have run even faster had he not made a couple of strategic errors.&nbsp; Chris Mutty '19 ran 1:59.49 to win his section.</p>
            <p align="left">Michael Kaba '16, in addition to the 200 and 4x400 later in the meet, raced in the 60 Meter High Hurdles.&nbsp; His start was off and he had to cut his step into the first hurdle but still ran a competitive 8.45.</p>
            <p align="left">States Lee '16 ran the fastest time for the Engineers in the 400.&nbsp; The senior got the break in 22.4 out of lane three then tightened up in the final 100 to finish in 48.55, a season best.&nbsp; Danny Newman '17 raced well to run 49.30, a personal best, and Derek Barnes '16 ran equally well to finish in 49.74, a season best.&nbsp; Tom Frejowski '19 ran an indoor personal best of 51.33.</p>
            <p align="left">In the 500, both Henry Tareque '17 and Brandon Corts '17 ran PR's.&nbsp; Tareque went out a little too fast in 25.1, but held on to run 1:06.38.&nbsp; Corts ran a more even pace of 26 and 52 en route to a 1:07.04.</p>
            <p align="left">Tre Albritten '18 took the lead in the 200 team standings as he ran 21.87, setting a new MIT record in the process, out of lane three no less.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaba ran a solid 21.96.&nbsp; Luca Cacopardo '18, once again drew lane two, but brought a good attitude to the race and ran a season best 22.58.</p>
            <p align="left">The Mile Run did not go as planned.&nbsp; Aidan Gilson '19 was not in the race to start with.&nbsp; The pace was not particularly fast as he came through  the 440 in 63.&nbsp; The pace slowed but Gilson did not react and allowed runners to pass him without challenge.&nbsp; He never totally gave up, but his 4:16.44 shows he did not own the race.&nbsp; Tangri was up next.&nbsp; His section went out in 64 and 2:09&nbsp;and he was right up at the front.&nbsp;&nbsp;He should have taken the lead then and moved away, but he bogged down and lost his instinct for the win.&nbsp; When the pace picked up he was unable to respond, finishing in 4:20.03.</p>
            <p align="left">The 4x400 Relay was the highlight of the day.&nbsp; MIT was in the second section with Kaba leading off.&nbsp;Despite a 22.2 first 200 he was back in second place.&nbsp; Kaba held it together to produce a 48.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Newman received the baton, but was too far behind first and too far ahead of third to feel any competition.&nbsp; Nevertheless he split 49.3.&nbsp; Wilson took off much better than he did two weeks ago, but despite a 23.2 200 he was passed, falling into third place.&nbsp; He kept it reasonably close as he split 49.6.&nbsp; Lee nearly blew the handoff, but managed to secure it.&nbsp;Lee moved into second place on the second lap&nbsp;and held it to the finish to split 47.9 for a cumulative time of 3:15.38.</p>
            <p align="left">David Walter&nbsp;'18 was the lone distance runner representing MIT in the meet.&nbsp; Running the 3K with hopes of running in the 8:30's, he moved up towards the front of the field as they came through the first 400 in 70 seconds.&nbsp; As they sped up to 67 pace, Walter ran one lap at that pace and then faded back to 70 pace through 2000 meters.&nbsp; He finished the race running 73's for an 8:48.26 performance.</p>
            <p align="left">Over at MIT&nbsp;there were some impressive performances, the most impressive in the Women's Shot Put.&nbsp; Not only did Isabella Stuopis '16 throw her season best in winning with a throw of 42-4 1/2&nbsp;and Jackie Vahey '17 return to her normal throwing range of 39', but Audrey Pillsbury '19 and Ariela Slutsky '18 threw big personal bests of 38-5 3/4 and 37-6 3/4 respectively as they moved to number five and number seven on the all-time MIT list.&nbsp; Vahey also threw&nbsp;a personal best in the Weight Throw, winning with a 52-10 1/4.&nbsp; Slutsky also threw a PR with her throw of 49-9 1/2.</p>
            <p align="left">Jen Tylock '17 vaulted 11-7 3/4 for a personal best and sole possession of number nine on the MIT top ten list.&nbsp; Also setting PR's were Makenzie Patarino '19 at 11-1 and Leah Schmitz '16 at 10-6.&nbsp; On the men's side, Scott Cameron '19 vaulted a personal best of 14-11.</p>
            <p align="left">Other season bests were run by Liz Cox '18 in the 800 at 2:26.66, Richard Lu '16 in the 60 Meter Dash at 7.23 and Adis Ojeda '19 with a 24.39 in the 200.</p>
            <p align="left">On Sunday, Cimmy Virdi '16 will compete  at the New Balance Grand Prix meet.</p>
