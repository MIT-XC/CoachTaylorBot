            <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold">Despite Record Numbers of Alums, Varsity Prevails</span></p>
            <p align="left">January 9, 2016</p>
            <p align="left">In the first team competition of the year, MIT hosted their annual Varsity vs. <a href="2016Alumni.pdf">Alumni/ae Meet</a>.&nbsp; Many alums made the trip to Cambridge to compete, but mostly to catch up with former teammates, coaches, friends and just to embrace that team feeling once again.&nbsp; In total&nbsp;there were 22 men and 19 women representing the &quot;Has Beens&quot;&nbsp;and quite a few more in attendance cheering them on.</p>
            <p align="left">The women's meet was quite competitive with the Varsity claiming the victory 76 to 45.&nbsp; A few more competitors and the Alumnae would have pulled off the upset.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alums took advantage of a Varsity squad that had some key injuries, that had very low numbers in some event areas and was missing their star pole vaulter, Cimmy Virdi '16, who was competing at the <a href="http://akron-pole-vault-convention.runnerspace.com/eprofile.php?event_id=10294&year=2016&do=info">Akron Pole Vault Convention</a> where she competed in the Elite section, clearing 13-1 1/2&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="left">Alumnae won four events.&nbsp; Louise van den Heuvel&nbsp;'14 took honors in the 800 with a wire to wire 2:17.75 victory.&nbsp; Preethi Vaidyanathan '15 took the victory in the High Jump at 5-3 3/4.&nbsp; Lauren Kuntz '13 claimed first place in the Pole Vault at 11-5 3/4.&nbsp; Michelle Johnson '15 won the the Triple Jump with a leap of 35-10 3/4.&nbsp; With a scoring format of 5-3-1 the victories only accounted for 20 or their 46 points.&nbsp; Ellen Liverpool '15 earned second place in the Weight Throw, which was probably the most dramatic event on the women's side.&nbsp; Liverpool had won the New England Division III title last year, but had transitioned to competing as a power lifter this year.&nbsp; Jackie Vahey '17 placed second in that competition and was figuring it was her time.&nbsp; Liverpool was not ready to hand over the bragging rights as the top weight thrower, as least not without a fight, which she started by throwing over 50' on her second throw.&nbsp; Vahey took a while to relax, but on her third throw she let the 20 lb. ball fly 52' for the lead and a new PR.&nbsp; Liverpool came back with a 51-6 1/2, but could not reclaim the lead.</p>
            <p align="left">Other scorers for the Alumnae were: Ashley Wheeler '15 - 2nd place Shot Put 31-6 1/2, Julia Sharpe&nbsp;'09 - 3rd place Triple Jump 32-0 3/4, Michelle Johnson '15 - 3rd place Long Jump 15-8 1/4, Abby Klein '14 - 3rd place Pole Vault 10-11 3/4, Veronica Szklarzewski '15 - 3rd place High Jump 4-7 3/4, Stephanie Birkhimer '15 - 2nd place 60HH 10.59, Lauren Kuntz '13 - 3rd place 60HH 10.60, Alina Gatowski '11 - 2nd place 5,000 18:41.38, Elaine McVay '15 - 3rd place 5,000 18:50.75, Alexandra Taylor '14 - 2nd place 400 65.00, Brooke Johnson '13 - 3rd place 400 71.53, Lauren Kuntz '13 - 2nd place 200 29.31, and Abby Klein '14 - 3rd place 60 8.99.</p>
            <p align="left">In addition to Vahey's Weight Throw victory, she also took first place in the Shot Put with a throw of 40-5 1/4, and then anchored the victorious 4x200&nbsp;comprised&nbsp;of Hannah Chen '18, Bailey Tregoning '19, and Maryann Gong '17.&nbsp; Nneoma Okonkwo '18 had a great day, winning both the 60 in a personal best of 8.00 and the Long Jump in another personal best of 17-6.&nbsp; In addition to her 4x200 leg, Hannah Chen won the 60HH in 9.49, took first place in the 200 in 26.28, claimed second in the 60 in a PR of 8.07 and earned second in the Long Jump in another PR of 17-2 1/4.&nbsp; Maryann Gong '17 won the mile, leading from start to finish in 5:08.59.&nbsp; Mary Eccles '18 also led wire to wire in winning the 5K in 18:23.76.&nbsp; Makenzie Patarino '19 added a 400 victory in 64.85 to her third place in the Pole Vault&nbsp;at 10-11&nbsp;3/4.</p>
            <p align="left">While the Alumni on the men's side brought the numbers, the Varsity squad is just too powerful this year.&nbsp; Despite some outstanding performances by the &quot;Has-Beens&quot;, they were overshadowed by current team members.&nbsp; In the end the score was 111 for the Varsity to 11 for the Alumni.&nbsp; Omari Stephens '08 was the high scorer for the alums, winning the Pole Vault at 14-11.&nbsp; Jordan Mizerak '14 added a second place in the High Jump at 6-0.&nbsp; Tyler Singer-Clark '14 took two third places&nbsp;in the 60 (7.27) and the 200 (23.22).&nbsp; Sam Parker '15 also earned a third place, doing so in the 800 with a 2:01.26.</p>
            <p align="left">The Varsity spread the wealth as there was only one double winner and that was Chris Sweeney '18, who&nbsp;won the 60&nbsp;in an extremely close photo finish over Michael Kaba '15 in 7.23 and claiming first place honors in the 200 in 23.09.&nbsp; In addition, Sweeney earned second place in the 60HH in 8.68.&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">There were many good battles that took place during the course of the meet.&nbsp;Perhaps the best of those was in the Triple Jump, an event where MIT should dominate at the Regional level. Carrington Motley '16 was the first to put one out there, jumping 44-10 on his second jump.&nbsp; In the third round Billy Ruschel '18 passed Motley with a 44-11 effort.&nbsp; Ryan Prinster '18 added a 44-1 1/4 to show he was in the mix.&nbsp; After passing their fourth and fifth attempts to save their legs a bit, the final round had some fireworks.&nbsp; Arinze Okeke '17 launched a 45-2 1/4 jump to take the lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Angle Ecchevaria '16 one-upped Okeke with&nbsp;a 45-3 1/2 effort.&nbsp; Motley improved to 44-10 3/4 on his final attempt,&nbsp;but Ruschel could not.&nbsp; Remarkable marks from short approaches by all MIT jumpers.</p>
            <p align="left">The Mile run was another one of those battles.&nbsp; Colin Godwin '17 took the lead, deciding to make it an honest race.&nbsp; His first 440 was 64 and Aidan Gilson '19&nbsp;was right with him along with the rest of the field.&nbsp; At 2:09, Gilson was the only one with him, but Josh Rosenkranz '19 and Kunal Tangri '19 were just behind at 2:10.&nbsp; When the pace slowed slightly to come through the 3/4 mile at 3:15, Rosenkranz moved up and decided to take the lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;All this did was wake up Gilson, who took over the lead and charged all the way to the finish in 4:18.45.&nbsp; Godwin seemed surprised by the move and did not respond soon enough, but did overtake Rosenkranz to claim second in 4:21.47.&nbsp; Rosenkranz earned third in 4:23.05.&nbsp; Tangri&nbsp;closed well to finish in 4:23.93.</p>
            <p align="left">In the next to last event, the 5,000, another battle took place.&nbsp;Cooper Sloan '18 threw down the gauntlet when he went to the lead with a 34 first 200 and 72 first quarter.&nbsp; The pace settled a bit but Sloan along with Rory Beyer '17 and Dennis Maloney '19 kept the pressure on the old timers with an initial 1600 of 4:54.&nbsp; The second 1600 was slowing so Beyer took over the lead&nbsp;early on, but the threesome still slowed to a 4:58.&nbsp;The third 1600 really bogged down as they started running 76-77 second quarters.&nbsp; Maloney moved to the lead, but that got Cooper moving who with 200 to go sprinted to the lead, finishing in 15:28.68.&nbsp; Maloney was second in&nbsp;15:29.15 and Beyer third in 15:31.28.</p>
            <p align="left">MIT had many event winners during the meet.&nbsp; Okeke had an impressive long jump of 22-3 3/4 to win that event.&nbsp; Trevor McMichael '19 cleared 6-0 to win the High Jump.&nbsp; Cody Bratten '18 won the Shot Put with a throw&nbsp;of 41-7.&nbsp; Alex Noakes '16 was the victor in the 35 lb. Weight Throw at 43-11 1/2.&nbsp; Michael Kaba '15 won the 60HH in 8.62.&nbsp; States Lee '15 ran an impressive 50.69 on the notoriously tight turns of the MIT track to win the 400.&nbsp; Jarod Wilson '19 led start to finish in the 800 to win in 1:58.31.&nbsp; The quartet of Lee, Kaba, Luca Cacopardo '18 and Wilson ran 1:32.67 to win the 4x200 Relay&nbsp;for a new meet and varsity record.</p>
            <p align="left">Other alums who competed were Hazel Briner '11, Justin Bullock '14, Martina de&nbsp;Geus '14, Matt Falk '12, Caroline Figgatt '11, Jared Forman '13, Kris Frey '15, Kyle Hannon '13, Matt Jordan '15, Eric Khatchadourian '06, Nick Leonard '11, Allen Leung '15, Maggie Lloyd '12, Pat Marx '13, Chris Masalsky '91, Eric Safai '14, Nate Sharpe '09, Rebecca Stavely '11, John Thomas '15, Logan Trimble '13, Cyrus Vafadari '12, Roy Wedge '14, and Jackson Wirekoh '13.</p>
            <p align="left">Others in attendance cheering on the fellow &quot;Has Beens&quot; were Kaitlin Allen '14, Kirsten Aarsvold '11, Emily Cole '09, Josh Duncavage '13, Michael DuPlessis '14, Kayla Harris '15, Joe Roy-Mayhew '08, Ben Schreck '15, Don Shobrys '75, Jason Tong '79 and Benji Xie '15.</p>
            <p align="left">Next week MIT moves North to compete at Bates College against Bates and Colby in the women's meet and Bates, Colby and Southern Maine in the men's meet.</p>
