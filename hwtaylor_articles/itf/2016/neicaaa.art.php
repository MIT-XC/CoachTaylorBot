              <h3>Records and National Marks Highlight MIT Performances</h3></center></strong></h4>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On the first day of the <a href="neicaaa.res.php">New England Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association (NEICAAA) Championship</a>, MIT track and field athletes set one varsity record and one freshman record,&nbsp;and had many top 30 NCAA Division III performances.&nbsp; Day two brought two more varsity records and more National qualifiers.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The NEICAAA is an association of all Division I, II and III teams in New England.&nbsp; With four weekends of championships in succession, MIT goes after two of the four, the New England Division III Championships competed last weekend and the NCAA Division III Championship in two weeks.&nbsp; This weekend the Engineers rest many of their athletes, and those that do compete do so to better their team's chances at Nationals.&nbsp;Despite only having partial teams, MIT placed ninth in the men's competition with 27 points.&nbsp; The women finished 13th with 19.5 points.</p>
            <p>The men's Pole Vault was the first event in which MIT competed.&nbsp; Marshall Wentworth '16 tied his personal best by clearing 14-11.&nbsp; Freshman Scott Cameron also competed, clearing 14-5 1/4.&nbsp; With Cimmy Virdi '16 taking the weekend off, Sherry Wan '16 was MIT's top vaulter, tying for 7th with a personal best of 11-09 3/4, moving her in a tie for eighth on the all-time MIT list, and a tie for 29th on the NCAA Division III indoor ranking.&nbsp; Jen Tylock '17 cleared 11-3 3/4 and Freshman Makenzie Patarino cleared 10-10.</p>
            <p>On the track, States Lee '16 got things moving by running the fastest time in the 400 trials, a season best 48.41, which currently ranks him at 14th in the country for DIII.&nbsp; Danny Newman '17 poorly managed the break, having to decelerate going into the second lap, which killed his race.&nbsp;Nevertheless Newman ran 49.58.&nbsp; In the women's race, Hannah Chen '18 ran a personal best 56.59, putting her eleventh on the NCAA ranking.</p>
            <p>In the 60HH, Chris Sweeney '18 ran 8.44 to make finals.&nbsp; Michael Kaba '16 did not have his best race, running 8.68.&nbsp; Both irritated their hamstrings and withdrew from the remainder of the meet.&nbsp; Kaba is currently ranked 11th on the NCAA list with a best of 8.20 while Sweeney is ranked 25th.</p>
            <p>Tre Albritten '18 leaned too far forward at the start of the 200, taking nearly 50 meters to regain his balance, yet still ran 21.90 to make finals.&nbsp; Albritten is ranked 13th in NCAA Division III.</p>
            <p>In the men's 5K, Dennis Maloney '19, who had forgotten his spikes, borrowed a teammate's shoes, then had one of those spikes pulled off in the first mile when a competitor stepped on his heel.&nbsp; Yet he ran an MIT freshman record of 14:47.94.&nbsp; Maloney ran 1600 splits of 4:43, 4:42, 4:50 before unloading a 32 final 200 to place fourth.&nbsp; Despite his bloody foot, Maloney had a lot left in the tank, showing he could run some great races in the future.&nbsp; His performance ranks him seventh on the all-time MIT list.</p>
            <p>Back to the field events, Arinze Okeke '17 jumped an impressive 23-2 3/4 in the Long Jump to place fourth.&nbsp; Okeke's performance ranks him ninth on the NCAA list and third on the all-time MIT list.&nbsp; Nneoma Okonkwo '18, who last week had tied the MIT Long Jump record at 17-8 3/4, jumped 17-11 to place eighth.</p>
            <p>In the Weight Throw, Jackie Vahey '17 placed third with a new personal best of 54-11 1/4.&nbsp; Vahey is ranked 19th in the country.&nbsp; Ariela Slutsky '18 also threw a personal best, just missing finals with a throw of 50-4.</p>
            <p>Finishing off the day on the track was the DMR.&nbsp; The men, fielding a team mostly comprised of freshmen, were hoping to improve their national ranking, but more importantly, run to their potential.&nbsp; Kunal Tangri '19 led off with the 1200 leg.&nbsp; Running defensively and not owning the race, he fell back as the race progressed, but still ran a solid 3:04.3.&nbsp; Lee returned from his 48.41 open 400 to move the team up four spots with a flying 48.0.&nbsp; Jarod Wilson '19 quickly moved up to the next team by splitting 53.7.&nbsp; He continued to move up, running an impressive 1:51.5 to put MIT near the lead.&nbsp; Aidan Gilson '19 took the baton and ran with the runners around him, coming through the 400 in 60.2.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter Gilson looked uncomfortable, but due mostly from over-thinking his situation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he fought his thoughts and continued to push, running a personal best 4:12.8 to bring his team in at sixth place.&nbsp; Overall the team ran 9:56.67, a&nbsp;time that currently ranks them seventh on the NCAA list.</p>
            <p>The women were already ranked number one in DIII, but knew the mark would not stand and wanted to put up a performance that would solidify their trip to Nationals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole Zeinstra '16, fresh off her fantastic double at DIII's, led off with the 1200 leg.&nbsp; She was hoping for 72 second quarter pace, but the entire field went out in 32-33 for the first 200.&nbsp; Even slowing the pace, Zeinstra still came through the 400 in 69 and the 800 in 2:23.&nbsp; She definitely died at that point, but remained composed to&nbsp;finish with a 76 for a 3:38.6 performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chen ran the 400 leg, but did not look recovered from her 56.59 open 400 earlier.&nbsp; She ran a 58.0 but did not make up much&nbsp;if any ground.&nbsp; Bailey Tregoning '19, just as Wilson had done in the men's DMR, got pulled out too fast as she attempted to close ground on the leaders.&nbsp; Her early splits were 30.1 and 63.5.&nbsp; She continued to move up in the field as she split 1:39 through 600 meters, then moved into fifth as she held on to run 2:13.4.&nbsp; Maryann Gong '17, only racing the relay in this meet, held nothing back as she closed on the leaders.&nbsp; In so doing she went out too fast, running 33 and 68 for the first two laps.&nbsp; Even settling in with the leaders she came through the 800 at 2:21.&nbsp; Instead of blowing by the leaders she settled in behind them.&nbsp; We will never know if this was the right decision, but it certainly made sense at the time.&nbsp; However, the pace slowed to a 74&nbsp;before picking up again for the final 400.&nbsp; Gong thought about going past with 300 to go, but decided against it.&nbsp; They picked up the pace and she was only able to hold on, but not pass, running a 4:47.6 for a cumulative time of 11:37.76, a solid national leading time.</p>
            <p>Day two started with the Triple Jump for the men.&nbsp; On his final jump Okeke jumped 47-7 to make finals.&nbsp; He was unable to move up, finishing sixth in the field and is ranked fifth in the country for Division III.&nbsp; Billy Ruschel '18 and Carrington Motley '16 tied at 46-4, not making finals.&nbsp; Ruschel is ranked 12th.</p>
            <p>Isabella Stuopis '16 had a very solid effort in the Shot Put.&nbsp; After making the finals she improved to 42-7 1/2, a season best that was good enough for fourth place.</p>
            <p>On the track, States Lee was in the fast section of the final of the 400.&nbsp; The slow&nbsp;section ran first and two individuals ran sub 48 performances.&nbsp; In the fast section Lee earned the break with a 22.6 and held the lead to the finish, running a new personal best of 48.00, good enough for a new MIT record and the fourth best time in Division III&nbsp;this season.</p>
            <p>In the 200, Albritten was the seventh fastest in the trials.&nbsp; Getting a much better start in the finals, he was second in his section and fourth overall with a new MIT record of 21.79.&nbsp; Albritten is now ranked ninth on the national list.</p>
            <p>Next up for MIT was the 3K.&nbsp; Aidan Gilson was hoping for a national qualifying time, which would probably take something under 8:20 at the very least.&nbsp; The initial pace was a little slow, but picked up nicely as Gilson came through the 1600 in 4:26 and looked strong running in a close fifth place.&nbsp; The pace had picked up to 65 seconds per quarter, but Gilson slipped to 67 after one quarter and then pulled the parachute, slowing to 72 then 74 before closing in 35 for an 8:34.98.&nbsp; Next up was Nicole Zeinstra.&nbsp; Also looking for a national qualifying performance, probably a 9:55 or better.&nbsp; She was running well, coming through the 800 in 2:37.&nbsp; There had already been a lot of contact, but after 1000 meters she was pushed and fell, hitting both knees hard.&nbsp; She limped off the track with hopes of trying again next week.</p>
            <p>The final event for MIT was the 4x400 Relay.&nbsp; With Kaba sitting out, Jarod Wilson was put back in the relay.&nbsp; Seeded in the fast section with their best of 3:15.38, they moved Lee to the leadoff leg, normally Kaba's leg.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Lee drew lane one and after having already run three 400's, each in 48, he was last coming out of the break.&nbsp; However, with a great second lap he was able to move into third place at the handoff.&nbsp; After a successful handoff, Lee angled off the track instead of following a straight path per the NCAA rules.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the outgoing Tufts runner ran into him, ending their effort and disqualifying MIT.&nbsp; The Engineers were unaware of being disqualified since it happened after the handoff.&nbsp; Wilson was in third, one team dropped the baton and suddenly he was in second.&nbsp; After a 23.0 first 200 he finished strong, taking the lead with a 49.3 leg.&nbsp; Derek Barnes '16 took over, ran a little too fast at 22.1, but did what was necessary to maintain the lead.&nbsp; In the second lap he lost the lead but it was very close at the handoff as he finished in 49.0.&nbsp; Danny Newman anchored, stalking the leader with a 22.5 leadoff lap. In the second lap, coming off the final turn Newman came into the finish determined to win and he did, finishing in 47.9 and an amazing 3:15.06 victory.&nbsp; Then the realization that the team was disqualified sunk in.&nbsp; Adding Kaba back in and hopefully not getting lane one again and MIT may have what it takes to win Nationals.</p>
            <p>Next week, MIT will send those who have qualified to the IC4A Championship at Boston University.&nbsp; Others with a hope of making Nationals will compete at the Tufts Last Chance Qualifier on Friday.            </p>
