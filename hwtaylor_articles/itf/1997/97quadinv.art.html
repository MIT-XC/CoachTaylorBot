</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Next Friday and Saturday the Men's Indoor Track and Field Team will host

the New England Division III Championships. This weekend they hosted an invitational to

allow them to improve their performances in preparation for those Championships.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">After an average showing last week, the Engineers wanted to show

themselves and their competition that they were indeed among the favorites for the New

England Division III Title.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The team had their best outing of the season in this non-scoring meet

with numerous team members achieving personal and season bests. Matt Sandholm '97

continued his perfect season in the 55 Meter Dash, equaling his season best time of 6.59

and improving his season best in the 200 with a 23.20 performance.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the 400 Meters, all four Tech performers achieved season bests. Edgar

Ngwenya 'G ran 53.46, John Kim '98 ran 53.81, Neal Karchem '99 ran 54.02, and Brian

Banaszak ran 56.99.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Martin Suresh '99 has been improving all season, and continued in the

600 Meters with a PR of 1:27.35.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Dan Helgesen '97 knew that if he wanted to get in the fast section of

next weekend's 800 Meters, he was going to have to run much faster than his best of 1:59.

This he did with a 1:57.36 winning effort.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the 1000 Meters, Joel Ford '98 was in the same position as Helgesen,

and responded equally as well with a 2:34.3. Also getting a PR in the 1000 was Ray Molnar

'00, running 2:47.3.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the 1500 all 6 runners had best performances. Leif Seed '99 4:03.48,

Mike Parkins '99 4:07.31, Chris McGuire '00 4:09.38, Gabe White '00 4:21.30, Kaoru Aou '00

4:31.79, and Stanley Hu '00 4:41.19 showed that MIT has little to worry about in the near

future as far as the 1500 is concerned.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the Triple Jump, Morio Alexander 'G had a season best of 43-11 1/4,

just missing a 45 foot jump on his next to last attempt.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the Pole Vault, Dafe Ogagan '97 competed for the first time this

season, qualifying for next weekend's Championship with a vault of 12-09. Setting a PR in

the vault was freshman Matt Potts with a 12-3 effort.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 35 lb. Weight Throw was another event where MIT had great success as

4 of the throwers had all time bests. Mike Butville '98 led the way with a Provisional

National Qualifying Mark of 50-04 3/4, Jason Dailey '99 followed with a 46-1 effort.

George Torres '99 improved for the 2nd week in succession by throwing 42-5 1/4. Having a

huge personal best was Brian Wong '99, throwing 39-5 to close out his season.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the Shot Put, Patrick Dannen '98 had a great series and ended up

throwing a PR of 42-9 1/4. Patrick's mark qualifies him for next week's Championships.</font>

</p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Next Friday things get underway with the Pentathlon at 12:00. On

Saturday the remaining events are contested beginning at 11:00 and ending around 4:00. </font></p>
