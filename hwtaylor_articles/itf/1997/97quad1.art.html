<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="5">MIT LOSES QUAD OPENER TO WILLIAMS<br>

<br>

</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">This Saturday MIT Men's Track Team embarked to Williamstown to face

Williams College, Norwich University, Middlebury College, and Westfield State College.

This was the first time MIT had competed at Williams for and Indoor Meet since 1989 due to

the smaller size of their track.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT Teams under Coach Taylor had not lost an Indoor Track Meet at

Williams during his tenure and he hoped that streak would continue. However, Williams has

come a long way since then; winning back to back National Championships in Men's Cross

Country in 1994 and 1995, as well as finishing 2nd in last year's Outdoor National

Championship due to a false start in the 1600 Relay.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">On paper the meet looked very close, with both teams suffering the loss

of key competitors for one reason or another. In reality, it was also very close with

Williams squeaking out a 244 to 243 victory.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT led for most of the way, winning the early events handily. John

Wallberg 'G led the way in the 35 lb. Weight with a toss of 58-02 1/2 and was followed by

Mike Butville '98 with a throw of 49-03 1/2 on his last effort. In the Mile, MIT ran

together in a strategic race and were led to a 1,3,5,and 6 finish by Leif Seed '99 in

4:28.99. Things continued to go Tech's way in the Long Jump. Morio Alexander 'G (21-4),

won the event and led MIT in outscoring Williams 21-10. At the end of those 3 events MIT

was up 64-35. The High Hurdles were next and was won by Ravi Sastry '98 in a nice time of

8.11, again leading MIT 16-10 over Williams.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The Engineers lost their first event of the day in the 400. Morio

Alexander jogged over from the Jumps and ran a 53.78, getting edged out by a Williams

runner by .09 seconds. MIT still outscored Williams 17 to 12. With MIT up by 40 points,

Williams started to rally. They really came through in the 600 Meters with a great

performance by Derek Sasaki-Scanlon (8 events and 50 1/4 points), winning in 1:25.10, and

outscored MIT 20-9. The High Jump, also won by Sasaki-Scanlon went 18-7 for Williams. The

lead was now down to 18 points.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 55 was won by Matt Sandholm '97 in 6.59, but his were the only

points for MIT, as Williams scored 19 points. It was about this time that the Shot Put was

ending, again giving Williams an edge 15-10. With MIT up by only 3 points, it was time to

depend on the strength of the Middle-Distance group. Leif came back in the 800 for another

victory, but the event was a wash 18-18. In the 1000, Joel Ford '98 came back from the

Mile and won in 2:38.26, but Williams took the event 20-15, leading for the first time in

the meet.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the 200, MIT's top sprinters and 400 runners came back. Sandholm got

edged out by the Williams sprinter even though he ran 23.37. MIT's other sprinters could

fare no better, as Williams came away with a 10 point lead. Fortunately, freshman Chris

McGuire came through to win the 5000 and lead the Engineers to an 18-16 victory in the

event. The Triple Jump saw yet another battle between Sasaki-Scanlon and Alexander.

Alexander again came away victorious. In a pivotal jump Sastry and Jared Miller '98 both

passed the 3rd place jumper from Westfield State on their last attempt, only to have him

pass Miller back on his last attempt.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The relays canceled each other out for the most part. Williams, again

led by Sasaki-Scanlon, won the 1600 Meter Relay. MIT's guns were shot in the sprint area,

but the Middle-Distance guys came through for yet a third time in winning the DMR.

Westfield State stole 3 points from Williams by passing them in the latter half of the

race, putting MIT up by 3 points with only the Pole Vault to go.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">With 5 vaulters remaining and the bar going to 13-6, MIT had 2 jumpers

as did Williams. However, Williams vaulters had personal bests on 15-1 (Sasaki-Scanlon)

and 14-6, whereas MIT's bests were 13-9 and 13-3. Mike DeMassa '97 went out at 13-6 for

MIT, but the other jumpers all continued. At this point, MIT had to hope that the

Middlebury jumper would get 2nd or 3rd, with Andrew Jamieson '99 from MIT getting the

other spot. At 14-0 the Middlebury vaulter went out, leaving the situation that Jamieson

had to win the event in order for MIT to win. At 14-6, 9 inches over his best, Jamieson

came through and cleared it. Of course, so did Sasaki-Scanlon. The other Williams vaulter

did not clear, so now there were two.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">At 14-9, Jamieson needed to set yet another personal best in order to

lead MIT to victory. It was not to be. Jamieson had some good attempts, but neither he nor

Sasaki-Scanlon cleared the height. Sasaki-Scanlon won the event on fewer misses (1-2). It

does not get much closer than that. </font></p>
