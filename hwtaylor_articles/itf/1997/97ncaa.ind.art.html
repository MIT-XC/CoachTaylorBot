<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="5">WALLBERG EARNS 5TH ALL-AMERICA AWARD, 1ST NATIONAL

CHAMPIONSHIP<br>

</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The Men's Indoor Track and Field Team had two qualifiers for the NCAA

Division III Indoor Track and Field Championships held at the University of Wisconsin -

Oshkosh. However, only John Wallberg 'G made it in. Mike Butville '98, had qualified

provisionally in the 35 Lb. Weight Throw, the same event as John, but did not get in.</font>

</p>



<p><font SIZE="4">John had the best mark (60-02) entering the competition, leading the

field by nearly 2 feet. The competition was set up so that there would be two flights (one

of 6, and one of 7), each participant receiving 3 throws, with the best eight making the

final and an opportunity for 3 more throws. John was scheduled to throw in the second

flight. The first flight did not show much. The second seeded thrower did not throw well

and did not even make the finals. The best throw coming out of the first flight was 54-3.</font>

</p>



<p><font SIZE="4">John did not begin well. A slow circle, combined with John's late

step-in led to a sub par 55-10 throw in the trials. This not only gave others hope, but

put John in second behind a Bate's thrower with 56-4.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">After correcting the technique problem during the ensuing warm-up

period, John led off his final's throws with a 59-4 effort. No one got any closer, and

John won by 3 feet. On his last two throws, John attempted to go for the MIT Record of

61-4, but it was not to be.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">John finished his MIT career with the Freshman Records in both the

Weight and Hammer, as well as the Varsity Record in the Hammer. He made the National

Championships all but his freshman year indoors. He finished 6th Indoors his Sophomore

year for his first All-America Award. His Junior year he was 4th Indoors and 3rd Outdoors.

His Senior year, John red-shirted his Indoor Season, but took 2nd Outdoors. </font></p>
