</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The Men's Track Team Members who qualified for the IC4As did pretty well

this weekend at Princeton. The IC4A Championships are the oldest and most prestigious

championship in the United States. It is primarily a Division I Conference, but other

division Institutions can join. To qualify for this meet is quite an achievement at our

level. To see the standards necessary to qualify for the meet look up this URL:

<p><font SIZE="4">John Wallberg 'G, started things off in the Weight Throw. After some

good warm-ups, John started okay with 57-7 3/4 effort. Needing only 60' to make finals, we

both thought he would be there. However, on his next two throws he stepped wide and was

out of position, making his first throw his best one. John finished 12th overall.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Joel Ford '98, was up next in the 1000. He was seeded 19th out of 25,

but finished 15th with an even split 2:30.35 effort. Joel had to quickly get his mind off

of this race and concentrate on his next one in less than 2 hours, the 3200 Relay.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Last, was the relay. The relay team qualified for this meet with a

7:44.40 effort the week before at Boston University's very fast banked track. The goal was

to make the finals, which historically takes about a 7:40 effort. Dan Helgesen '97, led

things off, staying competitive, and running a much better race than the week before with

a 1:57.6 first leg. Leif Seed '99, was next and ran a great leg, taking off after the

competition in splits of 26, 54, and 1:23 to finish in 1:54.0. Edgar Ngwenya 'G, began the

leg competitively with splits of 27, 56, and 1:26, but faded badly in the last 200 to a

2:00.2, putting the team out of any chance to make the finals. Joel ran as if he were

unaffected by the team's position or his previous race, and ran a very competitive 1:56.6.
