</font></b></p>



<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="4">TUFTS AND BATES LACK DEPTH TO PULL OFF VICTORY<br>

<br>

</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">On Saturday, the 2nd week of Quad Cup competition was hosted and won by

MIT (216) over Bates (146 1/2), who having won their first week's competition was coming

into the meet undefeated. Tufts (160 1/2) having lost to Bates, but looking strong on

paper, looked to be the pre-meet favorite. Others in the meet were Rhode Island College

(19), UMass/Dartmouth (19 1/2), and Worcester State College (25 1/2).</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">All teams must send in their performances prior to the meet in order to

seed the events properly. Based on this, Tufts had the superior team by about 10 points.

However, since Bates had defeated Tufts the week before, and by a significant margin, Tech

was understandably worried about the outcome.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Quad Meets are scored 9-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 in the individual events and

9-6-3-0 if four teams are entered in the relays (changes slightly if fewer or more teams).

The meet began with Bates looking great in their best event, the 35 lb. Wt. Throw, scoring

2nd, 4th, 6th, and 7th places in an event that saw the top 5 throwers over 50 feet. John

Wallberg won the event, tying his personal best of 58-02 1/4, but that was it for MIT in

the scoring of that event.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT ruled the Long Jump and Pole Vault, outscoring Bates 38 to 18 and

Tufts 38 to 12. Even though MIT won neither event, the Tech competitors came through with

solid performances. The other jumps (Triple and High) did not go so well. Tech scored 9

points in the High Jump and that was actually a big plus, as they had planned on only

scoring 4 or 5. Leif Seed '99, came back after the 1500 Meters and nailed 5-10 to claim

4th, while Ravi Sastry '98, garnered 5th, also jumping 5-10. In the Triple, Morio

Alexander 'G finished off a great day, (2nd-Long Jump, 3rd-400, 6th-200) with a season

best effort on his last jump to fall 1/4&quot; shy of first place. Sastry scored the only

other points for MIT, winning 8th place.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">After looking good in the trials of the 55 Meter Dash by qualifying all

4 runners for the finals, and running two of the fastest times in the Hurdle Trials, MIT

had a poor showing in the 1500. &quot;We got crushed at the start,&quot; said Coach

Halston Taylor. Indeed, the Engineers fell into the back of the pack while a freshman from

Bates took control of the race. Leif Seed gave chase, but had to work too hard getting up

to the front, and ran out of gas near the end. MIT still outscored their opponents in the

race, but were hoping for a few more and a more competitive effort.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the 55 Meter High Hurdles, fatigued runners Sastry and Lincoln Bonner

'97 made a valiant effort but finished 2nd and 3rd respectively behind a Tufts runner.

Bonner ran a personal best of 8.18 seconds in his effort. Both Sastry and Bonner were also

in the Long Jump, High Jump, and Dash. In addition, Sastry still had the Triple Jump to

come and Bonner the 200 Meter.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 400 and 600 provided great efforts for MIT, but a lack of depth in

these events hurt the overall effort. Brad Geilfuss 'G joined Alexander in scoring in the

400 with a 4th place finish. In the 600 Meter, Edgar Ngwenya 'G ran a great race,

finishing in 1:25.51, 2 tenths out of 1st. Neal Karchem '99, scored the only other Tech

point with a 7th place finish. Those 2 events provided Tufts with a 9 point edge and Bates

a 3 point difference over MIT in just those events.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">From that point on, MIT competed very well as a team. In the Dash, Matt

Sandholm '97 won easily in 6.68. MIT also placed 4th, 7th, and 8th. Tech then scored a

total of 29 points in the 800 and 1000 Meter Runs, getting great efforts out of Dan

Helgesen '97, Leif Seed, Joel Ford '98, Sohail Husain '98, Martin Suresh &quot;99, and

Gabe White '00.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 200 Meter event secured the team victory for MIT. Sandholm again won

easily and Bonner ran a great time of 23.85 for a personal best to get 2nd place. Geilfuss

placed 4th and Alexander 6th to give MIT 24 points in just this event.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Remaining were the Shot Put and the relays. Wallberg rallied for a

personal best in the Shot Put, throwing 47-0 1/4 for 2nd place and got unexpected backup

from Patrick Dannen '98 for 6th and George Torres '99 for 7th place. The relays were a

moot issue, but Coach Taylor had the star middle-distance runners get together to win the

1600 Relay in a season best time of 3:32.9. They need a good seed time to get into the

fast section of the upcoming New England Division III Championships, which will be hosted

by MIT on February 14 and 15.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Next week, MIT heads to Maine to compete with Bowdoin, and Norwich at

Bates. Bowdoin's involvement may be more of a hindrance to MIT and a help to Bates than

Tufts was. </font></p>
