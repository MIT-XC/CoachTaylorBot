<p align="center"><b><font SIZE="5">Qualify 2 and a Relay for IC4As<br>

<br>

</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">This past Friday and Saturday, MIT Men's Track and Field Team competed

at the NEIAAA (All Division New England) Championships held at Boston University. The

Engineers scored in three events for a total of 4 points. This placed them in a tie for

19th place overall.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Leading things off for MIT was the Pole Vault. The starting height was

13-6, which was not a problem for MIT's vaulters, Andrew Jamieson '99 and Dafe Ogagan '97.

The field thinned out quickly and going into the 14-3 height only 10 vaulters remained.

Jamieson did not make the height, but he did beat out the other vaulters at the previous

height of 13-9 1/4 to finish 7th. Dafe cleared 14-3 and had a good attempt at 14-9 for a

6th place finish and 1 point.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">John Wallberg 'G was up next in the 35 Lb. Weight Throw. John was the

7th seed going into the competition at 58-02 1/2. John had a great series and threw a

personal best of 60-02 for 6th place. That effort made John the 4th thrower in MIT's

history to throw over 60 feet. John now leads the country by nearly 5 feet in Division

III. Mike Butville '98 also qualified for the event, but threw below his seed at 48-00 3/4

for 19th place. Wallberg will throw at the IC4As in Princeton this weekend.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Next up for Tech was the running events. Ravi Sastry '98 and Lincoln

Bonner '97 led the way in the hurdles. Both ran a personal best of 8.03, qualifying for

the semi-finals on Saturday. Neither ran his best in the semis, but ran okay with times of

8.09 and 8.14 respectively.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Edgar Ngwenya 'G qualified for the 500 meters, but was entered in a

tough heat and could not make it out of the trials. Edgar ran 1:08.87.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Dan Helgesen '97 was up next in the 800. Dan was hoping to qualify for

Nationals and needed a 1:54 to have a good chance at making it. Dan got out well, but the

crowded field caused him some difficulty. Going into the 2nd lap, Dan got tripped and lost

his balance. By the time he recovered he was in the back of the pack and could not

recover. Dan ran 1:57.33 and did not make the finals.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Joel Ford '98 had qualified in the 1000, and was hoping to repeat his

performance of last year as a scorer in the event. Joel raced very well, going out in 55

at the 400 and 1:58 at the half. Joel faded a bit at the end, but held on for a personal

best of 2:29.54 and a place in the finals.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the finals, Joel ran a better paced race, but came through the 800 in

1:56. He was in place to win, but fatigue had its way, causing Joel to fade to 8th in

2:29.69. Joel qualified for this coming weekends IC4A Championship.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">In the 1500, Leif Seed '99, also trying to qualify for Nationals, was

running in a strategic race and thus a slow pace. When the pace picked up towards the end,

he could not keep up and faded to the back. Leif's pace stayed the same, but most of the

other runners picked up the pace. Leif ran 4:21.37 as he mistakenly leaned at the wrong

finish line, slowing before the actual finish line.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Mike Parkins '99 and Chris McGuire '00 were both entered in the 5000.

Mike, having not run the 5000 recently, was entered with a rather slow time, thus putting

him in the slower section. Mike tired of the slow pace and ran to the front. Leading the

race seemed to take its toll on Mike as he faded badly. Mike ran a personal best of

15:22.83, but was disappointed with his race.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Chris, fresh off of freshman record run the week before, was entered in

the fast section. The early pace may have been a little too fast for Chris, but he stayed

the course. Chris had a little trouble staying with pack after the 2nd mile, but focused

well, and held on for 6th place in the heat and 7th place overall with a new freshman

record of 15:10.41.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Saturday, the only new events for the Engineers were the relays. MIT was

entered in both the 1600 and 3200 Meter Relays. The 1600 Relay got a terrific leg from

Lincoln Bonner as they ran a season best of 3:29.41. Other members were Brad Geilfuss 'G,

Neal Karchem '99, and John Kim '98.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">The 3200 Meter Relay was the final and best event for MIT. Seeded 7th,

and relatively fresh except for Joel, the team was confident that they could qualify for

the IC4As. Having run a 8:00, they knew they would have to step it up a notch to run the

necessary 7:54. Helgesen led off in the packed field with a less than great 1:58.0, but he

kept the team in the mix. Seed grabbed the baton and ran great. Leif came through the 400

in 55 and continued to work his way to the front, coming in with a best ever 1:55.1 as he

handed off to Ngwenya. Edgar ran a very fast 54.8 first 400, but held on for his personal

best of 1:56.0. When Joel got the baton the team was in 4th, a little off the lead. Joel

ran a furious first quarter in 53 to close the gap. For an instant it looked as if he

might take the lead, but thought better of it. Nevertheless, Joel did not back off,

running the 600 in 1:22. He faded in the last lap, losing a place to UMass/Amhert, but

holding on for a 1:55.3. This was just 45 minutes after his 1000 final. The team ran a

huge season best of 7:44.40 and easily qualified for the IC4As.</font> </p>
