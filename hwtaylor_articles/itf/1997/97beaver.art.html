</font></b></p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT's post holiday competition got underway on January 11th with an

Invitational/Relay Meet. Participating colleges were Tufts, Coast Guard, Westfield State,

Umass/Boston and of course MIT. The meet was non-scoring, but very competitive.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">MIT had a very good showing in the meet, garnering first place in 8 out

of 17 events. The winners were; Matt Sandholm '97 in both the 55 and 200 Meter Dashes with

times of 6.66 and 23.45 respectively, Mike Parkins '99 in the 3000 Meters with a time of

9:01.43, the 1600 Meter Relay Team of Morio Alexander 'G, Brad Geilfuss 'G, Edgar Ngwenya

'G, and John Kim '98 with a time of 3:34. 98, the Distance Medley Relay Team (1200, 400,

800, 1600 meters) of Chris McGuire '00, Lincoln Bonner '97, Joel Ford '98, and Dan

Helgesen '97 with a time of 10:57.50, John Wallberg in the 35 Lb. Wt. with a throw of

52-09 1/4, Alexander in the Triple Jump with a leap of 43-03 1/4, and Andrew Jamieson in

the Pole Vault with a jump of 13-09.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">It was a nice meet to shake out the cobwebs from the Holiday layoff. A

number of athletes realized that they needed to get in shape and meet ready, but overall

the athletes looked like they are preparing for a successful season.</font> </p>



<p><font SIZE="4">Next week begins the 3 week quad-cup series. MIT travels to Williams for

the first time since 1989. During the Coach Taylor era, MIT has met Williams 14 times

indoors in non-championship meets. MIT has won 8 of those, but has not defeated Williams

since 1991. The winner of this meet has gone on to win the New England Division III

Championships in 10 of the 14 years.</font> </p>
