              <p style="font-size: 12px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Men Repeat as New England Division III Champions / Women Finish Four Points Out of First</span></p>
              <p align="left">February 18-19, 2011 </p>
              <p align="left">Rarely, if ever, do athletic competitions go perfectly for an entire team. MIT's defense of their <a href="ned3men.res.php">New England Division III Men's Indoor Track and Field</a> title was successful, but they never had the lead until the final event, pulling out a 114 to 112 victory over Williams College and nearly 40 other New England colleges at the host school, Springfield College.</p>
              <p align="left">Going into the meet, MIT was a slight favorite over the always competitive Williams College. However, on Tuesday, Pat Marx, the number one seed in the 800 and a key relay member, developed appendicitis and had to have surgery on Wednesday. This was a huge loss for the Engineers but they did not waiver in their confidence.</p>
              <p align="left">On day one, Williams had two entries in the pentathlon and MIT none. Although they were only seeded second and fourth, the Ephs managed a 1-2 finish for an early 18 point lead.</p>
              <p align="left">Day two began with the 35lb. Weight Throw and Long Jump. MIT had no long jumpers, but were seeded third and seventh in the Weight Throw. Williams had the fourth seed in the weight and fifth seed in the Long Jump. Williams showed they were there to compete as they pulled out a fourth and fifth in the Long Jump and a third in the Weight Throw. MIT started their meet with a poor result, finishing fifth (Ken Cooper '13) and tenth in the Weight Throw. Now behind 33 to 4, things were certainly not looking good.</p>
              <p align="left">The Shot Put, High Jump and Mile Run were the next events to be competed and MIT expected to outscore Williams in each event. The Shot Put, like the Weight Throw, did not go as hoped but Ken Cooper again managed a fifth and the Williams thrower did not score. In the High Jump, Matt Falk '12, came through with an excellent 6-4 performance, good for third place. However, the Williams jumper managed to finish second at the same height. The mile was the first event to really go MIT's way. Seeded sixth and eighth, MIT finished first and seventh. Kyle Hannon '13, worked the field expertly, enjoying the relatively slow 67, 2:13 first half pace. Hannon threw down a 1:31 final 600 meters to win in 4:17.56. Logan Trimble '13, was right with Hannon until the kick. Although he was not able to match Hannon's foot speed, he did run 4:21.96 to finish seventh. Williams did not score, bringing the totals to 41 for Williams and 26 for MIT, a much improved position.</p>
              <p align="left">The 55HH, 400, 600 were next on the track. MIT was not looking forward to the 55HH final. While all three MIT hurdlers; Andrew Musacchio '11, Nick Leonard '11, and Brent Johnson '14, ran season bests, none made the finals. Williams in the meantime, proceeded to place second and third after being seeded fifth and ninth. In the next event, the 400, MIT was not seeded to score and did not really come close. Williams, seeded second and third, even improved on that, placing first and third. The 600 was supposed to provide Williams with 10 points and MIT with seven as they were seeded fifth and sixth. Williams finally lost some seed points, finishing second. MIT, with David Way '13, stepped up to garner fourth place, but that was all the points MIT received. MIT now had 31 points to 79 for Williams. Again, it was not looking very good for the Engineers, but they did not pay attention to the score and kept taking the meet one event at a time.</p>
              <p align="left">Back to the field events, the Pole Vault and Triple Jump were finishing up. Nathan Peterson '12, was seeded to place second for MIT, but he found his groove in the vault, clearing 15-5 to take the victory. Cyrus Vafadari '12, seeded ninth, moved up one place to add a point to the MIT total. Williams also moved up, claiming sixth place when they were seeded seventh. In the Triple Jump, Mattias Flander '11, made his season by popping a two foot season PR and one foot indoor track personal best, jumping 46-2 to claim fifth place and push Williams back to sixth and seventh. The score was now 87 for Williams and 46 for MIT, still nothing to get excited about.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT was seeded to score 26 points to eight for Williams in the next three events, the 55 Dash, 800 ad 1000. In the 55, the sprinters showed they were ready to start the comeback. Babajide Akinronbi '14, ran back to back 6.60 efforts in the trials and finals to earn fifth place. Josh Duncavage '13, earned his seed, placing eighth. Dawit Zewdie '13, seeded 15th, raced very well out of the slow section, earning sixth place overall to add three more to the MIT cause. The big event, the 1000, had four MIT runners in the fast section and two more in the second section. In the slower section, Stephen Serene '12, took charge of the race and hammered home a 2:32.70 PR for the section win. The MIT runners did not push the pace in the fast section, opening it up to anyone, and could not handle the change in pace at the end. None of the four scored while Serene came away with the event victory. MIT did not get their 23 points, instead settling for 10, but Williams came away with nothing. The net gain in the three events for MIT was 18 points to zero for Williams, making it Ephs 87, MIT 64.</p>
              <p align="left">The 200, 3K, 5K, were the deal breakers for Williams. MIT's trio of Duncavage, Tyler Singer-Clarke '14 and Akinronbi scored 17 points in the 200, placing second, fourth and fifth respectively after only being seeded for nine. Williams, seeded for 10, only managed six. Joe Christopher '12, out for the past two weeks with low iron, ran an excellent race in the 3000, closing well to claim sixth in 8:41.12 and Paul Welle added an eighth in 8:43.32. Dan Harper '12, continued to have problems losing focus in the latter stages of races as he fell back when the very slow, strategic race picked up pace, but once again woke up in the final 800 to move up to fifth place in 15:22.42. Roy Wedge '14, added a point for eighth in 15:26.14. MIT earned another 26 points in the three events to just nine for Williams. Entering the three final events, all relays, the score was Williams 96, MIT 90.</p>
              <p align="left">The seeds in the relays are irrelevant since few teams have the same people running the actual event that ran the seed time. MIT's depth was counted on to pull them through when most teams had few if any fresh runners. The Distance Medley Relay was first and MIT was running with the quartet of Richard Prevost '11, Nick Leonard '11, Justin Bullock '14, and Eric Safai '14. Prevost set the tone, running a dominant 3:10 for the 1200 leg. Leonard ran a 52 second 400 to keep MIT at the front. Bullock, proven to be an outstanding competitor all season, got it done with a 1:58 800 leg. Safai, pushed the pace early and closed with a 61 to run 4:21 in the 1600 leg to give MIT the victory in 10:21.04. Williams placed fourth, putting MIT one point behind.</p>
              <p align="left">Williams had a much stronger 4x400, earning All America honors in 2010, but their quartet was too fatigued to place better than third. Without Marx, MIT was concerned about their ability to put together a quality 4x400. Fortunately, Singer-Clarke stepped up and put out a 51 second lead off leg on the tight turn track in his first 400 of the year. Mac Gager '14, also ran 51. Jake Jurewicz '14, challenged on the tight turns, was only able to run 52, but DJ Ronde '13, closed hard with a 51 to put MIT in fifth at 3:25.83, only losing two points to Williams.</p>
              <p align="left">The final event, the 4x800 would decide the champion. Both teams lined the track and started bringing the house down well before the event even started. MIT had plenty of bodies to produce a sub 2:00 800, but they needed a sure victory, so Kyle Hannon was substituted in. Logan Daum 11, did not run his absolute fastest race ever, but he put MIT in good position with a leadoff 2:01. Hannon came back for his third race and hammered the field with a 1:56. Gil O'Neil '13, fresh and ready to run, held the lead, running 1:59. Zewdie, coming back from the open 800, and knowing he had to win the race, held off the closing runner from Springfield repeatedly in the final 200 to give MIT the victory in 7:55.54. Williams needed to finish second to win the meet, but could only manage a 8:03 for fourth place and second in the meet.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT's men have now won both the cross country and indoor track and field New England Division III titles this year.</p>
              <p align="left">The <a href="ned3.res.php">Women's New England Division III Championship</a> was hosted by MIT. Williams College was seeded to win the meet by 13 points going into the meet, with MIT second. Similar to the men, the women missed some opportunities to put the meet away, then nearly climbed back, coming within four points at the end, losing to Williams 137 to 141.</p>
              <p align="left">On day one, MIT was hoping for a great start as Hazel Briner '11, was planning on defending her title and hitting the auto standard for the NCAA Championship in the pentathlon. The event started out well with a personal best of 8.61 in the 55HH. Her high jump was not great, but still a decent 4'11. The shot put, again not her best, but still a solid 33-5 1/4. In the long jump portion of the pentathlon, Briner did not take a well advised safety jump and ended up fouling out, putting her out of contention. Jackie Konopka '14, not seeded to score, put together a phenomenal five events to place third overall with 2958 points. Williams earned fourth place while they were not seeded to score, expanding on their predicted spread.</p>
              <p align="left">Day two began with the Long Jump and 20lb. Weight Throw. Briner and Jackie Brew '14, were seeded fourth and fifth to Williams' first and sixth in the Long Jump. Brew jumped a personal best of 17-6 3/4 to earn third, but Briner was not able to score. Williams earned first and fourth, adding to their lead. MIT had no one entered in the weight throw. Williams had a freshman seeded second but she only managed a sixth, giving MIT a little break. The score was now Williams 23, MIT 12.</p>
              <p align="left">The women's order of events is different than the men's, starting the running with the DMR, then the 5000 and the 4x200. In the DMR, MIT put together a strong team of Andrea Nickerson '14, Kirsten Aarsvold '11, Olivia Papa '14, and Anna Holt-Gosselin '11. Nickerson led off with a competitive 3:50 1200, followed by a 62.7 by Aarsvold in the 400. Papa put MIT in second place with a 2:23.6 800 and Holt-Gosselin took over and buried everyone with a 5:06.5 anchor for a 12:23.06. Williams closed hard, but too late, finishing second. In the 5K, Williams put in their two national qualifiers while MIT had four entries but none had been running at the level of the Williams runners. True to the seeds, Williams placed 1-2-3 for 24 big points. MIT managed an eighth place by Tania Morimoto '12, for one point. The 4x200 was a total domination by MIT, led by Portia Jones and her 24.9 split, Brew, Jamie Simmons '12, and Martha Gross '12, ran 1:44.57 to win by 2 1/2 seconds over second place Williams to set a new MIT record. Nevertheless, MIT was pretty far behind at this point, 63 to 33.</p>
              <p align="left">The Mile Run was next, followed by the 55HH and the 400, all events where MIT hoped to do very well. In the mile, freshman Louise van den Heuvel, grew frustrated by getting boxed in a bit, but still ran a solid race, placing seventh in 5:09.65 while Williams did not score. MIT pulled All America hurdler, Portia Jones '12, because of the other events she was in, and the need to counter Williams potential points in the 55 Dash. MIT still had three finalists in the event and made good on the seeds, placing third, fourth and fifth, all running season or personal bests in the event. Amy Magnuson 'G, ran 8.47, Briner a 8.52 and Brew a 8.59. Both Magnuson and Briner qualified provisionally for the NCAA Division III Championship. Once again, Williams did not score. The 400 was supposed to be Jones's event, but she did not get out well enough, losing the break and not making up the ground. Her second place in 58.39 was supported by a seventh place from Martha Gross '12, in 60.19. Williams was also blanked in this event. The score was looking better for MIT as they climbed to 60 points to the 63 for Williams.</p>
              <p align="left">The Shot Put and High Jump were finishing up and MIT was not seeded to score in either event and did not. Williams earned seven points in the Shot Put but zero in the high jump. Up by 10 now, 70 to 60, Williams had some of their strong events coming up.</p>
              <p align="left">The 600, 55Dash, 800 and 1000 were the next four events on the track, and MIT would need a miracle to make up much ground on Williams as Tech just did not have enough entries. In the 600, Jamie Simmons was seeded fourth, but everyone thought she had a good chance of winning. Not attacking the race as she is accustomed to, due in part to her coach's advise to not go out faster than upper 31's for the first 200, probably took the fire out of her legs. She just never got going, struggling a bit to get fourth place in 1:38.64. Williams earned third place in the race. The 55 Dash, with Jones seeded second and Brew seeded seventh gave MIT hope in battling the number three seed from Williams. The 4x200 and 400 took too much out of Jones's legs as she still ran 7.45, but in the talented field, that was only good for seventh. Brew ran 7.52, after running a new freshman record of 7.46 in the trials, missing a scoring place by one. Tanasia Hoffler, the winner of the long jump, also won the dash, an unexpected 10 points for Williams. MIT's Papa was seeded eighth in the 800 and improved on that, running an excellent 2:22.09 for sixth place. Williams earned fourth place and also second place in the 1000, an event where MIT did not have an entry. The score was again heavily in Williams favor, 99 to 70. </p>
              <p align="left">The final two individual events on the track were the 200 and 3000. Jones was up again, and the number one seed, was not happy with the results of the 55 Dash and 400. Jones blasted a new school record of 25.43, even though she eased up in the final five meters. Hoffler placed third for Williams. In the 3000, Holt-Gosselin returned from the DMR to run a truly inspirational race. Looking as though she might fall back a couple of times in the final 800, she took off with nearly 400 to go, finishing with a 35 final 200 to win in a new MIT record of 10:08.37. Martina de Geus '14, also ran an excellent race, placing sixth in 10:15.29. Williams earned fourth place to keep MIT at bay. The score now, MIT 91 to 110 for Williams. </p>
              <p align="left">The field events were now finishing up, the Pole Vault and the Triple Jump. The Pole Vault was to MIT what the 5K had been for Williams. Karin Fisher '11, won the event at 12-5 1/2, again just missing 13'. Briner came back to place second at 11-11 3/4, which was matched by teammate Lauren Kuntz '13, a new PR for third place. Kate Wymbs '14, placed eighth with a vault of 10-6, giving MIT 27 points in the event. In the Triple Jump. Magnuson and Brew, both made the finals when neither were seeded to do so. Magnuson placed seventh in 35-3 and Brew jumped 34-4 for eighth. Williams placed fourth in the vault and scored big in the Triple Jump with Hoffler winning her third event. The score going into the final two relays was Williams 130 to 121 for MIT.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT, the third fastest 4x400 team in the country, could have easily won that event. However, the 4x800, seeded only sixth, was not strong enough to hope for the win. The Engineers needed to win both relays and hope Williams would not be able to score more than 10 points in the two relays. Moving Briner and Simmons to the 4x800 to go with Papa and van den Heuvel, and moving in Megan Bumgarner '14 and Aarsvold to run with Gross and Jones in the 4x400 would give Tech the best chance to win both events. The 4x400 was first. Gross ran a great 61.3 first leg, although she was pushed and tripped by a Tufts runner entering the final turn. She recovered to hand off in first to Bumgarner. Bumgarner ran a great 61.6 to keep MIT in front. Aarsvold could not hang with the Tufts runner, finishing with a 62.7 split. Jones went out in 28, just not seeming to have what it would take to catch the Tufts anchor. Running 59.5 gave MIT second place, but Williams earned fourth place for five points. MIT was now down by six, needing to win the 4x800 and hope Williams would finish no higher than fifth. Papa led off with a 2:25.9, racing instead of getting out front and running her best, but certainly understandable for a freshman in her third race in the five hour meet. Simmons ran 2:22 to get MIT to the front. van den Heuvel ran 2:25 but had lost ground to the leaders. Briner took off in 33 for the first 200, catching the leaders. In the final 200, Briner took the lead but could not quite hold it, just losing in the final straight despite her 2:20 split. The 9:33.42 was good for second place, but Williams earned third place to close out the championship.</p>
              <p align="left">MIT just did not have enough guns, needing too much from too few. The quality of New England Division III Track and Field is just too high to win these meets with only a few stars.</p>
              <p align="left">The Engineers will now focus on getting individuals and relays qualified and ready for the NCAA Championship in three weeks. The next meet will be the All New England Championship at Boston University on February 25-26.</p>
