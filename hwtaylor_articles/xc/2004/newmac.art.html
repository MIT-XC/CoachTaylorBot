  <p align="left">Ben Schmeckpeper tood the lead from defending champion, Stan 
    Pyle of Wheaton College, just after two miles of the five mile race and never 
    looked back, winning by 47 seconds in a time of 25:07 on the wet course. Schmeckpeper's 
    victory led MIT to their seventh consecutive NEWMAC Championship, making them 
    the only team to ever take the traveling trophy home. MIT secured fourth through 
    eighth places, giving them six in the top eight for a low score of 23 points. 
    Coast Guard was second with 52 points, Springfield was third with 87, Wheaton 
    claimed fourth with 100, WPI raced to fifth with 129, Babson managed sixth 
    place with 166 and Clark rounded out the scoring by finishing seventh with 
    198 points.</p>
  <p align="left">With a light mist falling, the seventh annual NEWMAC Cross Country 
    Championship was off and running. Pyle took off with a strategy that appeared 
    as though he wanted to run away with the race in the first mile, hoping no 
    one would go with him as he covered the first mile in 4:48. Schmeckpeper, 
    coming around to championship form, was undaunted by the pace. The two of 
    them opened up a fourteen second lead by the mile and :36 by the two mile. 
    The battle for third place was waging between Mike Flint of Coast Guard and 
    John Brewer of MIT, who had separated themselves from the trailing pack by 
    four seconds at the mile mark.</p>
  <p align="left">The pack, led by Coast Guard and WPI runners went out fast relative 
    to previous performances. With the exception of Schmeckpeper and Brewer and 
    a slightly ambitious Eric Khatchadourian, who was running in the front of 
    the pack, the MIT runners were content to trail the pack and follow their 
    plan. By the second mile mark MIT had established a dominant position in the 
    pack but both Coast Guard and WPI were still in the race. At three miles, 
    MIT was in firm control and it was obvious that the other teams were falling 
    back. Schmeckpeper had a 50 meter lead by this point, Flint had started to 
    pull away from Brewer and MIT had taken over the top 10 with five runners 
    within two seconds of each other.</p>
  <p align="left">In the final loop the trends continued with few changes taking 
    place. While MIT had a very large delta between Schmeckpeper and their pack 
    of runners, the pack itself finished within :15 of each other. The question 
    to be answered; is Schmeckpeper that much better than the other runners in 
    New England that the MIT pack will be with the contenders for a national berth 
    in two weeks. </p>
  <p align="left">There appear to be five teams vying for four national spots, 
    although there are 60 eligible teams in New England. Favored Tufts seems to 
    be a clear cut favorite. Williams, Keene State and MIT are running well and 
    appear to have similiar teams and chances. Bates, thought to have the most 
    talent at the beginning of the season, does not seem to be running very well 
    right now. The New England Division III Championship / NCAA Division III National 
    Qualifier will be held on November 13 at 11:00 on the Twin Brook Recreation 
    Park in Cumberland, Maine.</p>
