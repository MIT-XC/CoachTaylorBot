  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT FADES IN FINAL MILE</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="+3">Holds on for Third in Twin Brook Invitational</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">Although Keene State ran an incredibly aggressive race and Tufts 
    took it easy, pacing their top seven runners in a pack, MIT was unable to 
    take advantage of either situation. Keene State took the victory in the twelve 
    team field with 49 points. Tufts literally ran together in a seven man line 
    and totalled 70 points for second place. MIT finished with 77 points, 25 points 
    ahead of fourth place, NEWMAC rival, Coast Guard.</p>
  <p align="left">M IT, determined to make up for their end of race fade in the 
    All New England Championship, ran in small groups well and for four miles 
    of the five mile race looked to be setting up for the win on the muddy course. 
    However, just as John Brewer moved into second place ahead of Mike Flint of 
    Coast Guard, Eric Khatchadourian was poised to pass Joseph Hegarty of Keene 
    State to move into fourth and Kevin Brulois had passed the group from Tufts 
    and joined Carlos Renjifo, only four seconds behind Ryan Gough of Keene State, 
    their third man at the time, MIT seemed to run out of gas. Brewer, running 
    a very gutsy race as he becomes accustomed to being able to run up in the 
    front of big races, could not win the battle with Flint and was also passed 
    by Dan Crespin from Brandeis, who had come from :17 down at the four mile 
    mark. Khatchadourian succeeded in passing Gough, finishing off a strong race. 
    Both Brulois and Renjifo faded badly, not only were they unable to make the 
    move on Keene State but lost twenty places between the two of them in the 
    final mile.</p>
  <p align="left">Although they are obviously trying their best, MIT still seems 
    to be having difficulty finding a consistent fifth man. On this particular 
    day the Engineers held out number one runner Ben Schmeckpeper, which certainly 
    would have made a difference in the outcome of the race. However, while Brulois 
    re-joined the top five, Fivos Constantinou suffered a set back as he lost 
    focus, on this very difficult course, during the third and fourth miles. Freshman 
    Chris Bruce has been relatively solid but unable to make the leap to within 
    one minute of the lead MIT runner. The delta of 1:13 for their 1-5 runners 
    was not very good, particularly with Schmeckpeper not in the race.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT heads to Waterford, Connecticut in two weeks to attempt 
    to retain their NEWMAC team title, which they have won all six years the conference 
    has been in existence. The race will take place at Harkness Memorial State 
    Park at 11:00 AM.</p>
