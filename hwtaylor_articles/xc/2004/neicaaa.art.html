  <p><strong><font size="+3">HARRIERS PLACE 11TH IN ALL NEW ENGLANDS DESPITE DISMAL 
    PERFORMANCES</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">October 8, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">The MIT men's cross country team managed an 11th place finish 
    at Franklin Park in this annual championship amongst all of the colleges in 
    New England, regardless of their NCAA division affiliation, despite poor races 
    by many of the team members. More important than the 11th place finish among 
    all the teams was the third place finish among Division III teams. MIT, with 
    319 points was only three points behind Williams College, but also only four 
    points ahead of Bates College. Tufts, the favorite among Division III schools 
    to take the regional qualifier in five weeks, ran well and placed sixth overall.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT runners could find many excuses, such as the 75 degree temperatures 
    and the fact that they had worked through the meet with two hard workouts 
    during the week, or even that some had had as many as four exams during the 
    week and some as late as the morning of the race. However, none was a justifiable 
    excuse for the majority who did not have enough passion to work through the 
    pain. Coach Halston Taylor claims his team is good enough to compete much 
    better than they exhibited on this day.</p>
  <p align="left">Leading the way for the Engineers was Ben Schmeckpeper, who 
    was hampered earlier in the season with an iron deficiency and is just now 
    getting to the point of working on good quality in practices. Schmeckpeper 
    went out in the back of the lead pack and managed to hold on for a 17th place 
    and a finish of 25:17 on a day when times were affected by at least 30 seconds 
    due to the high temperatures. Running the best race for Tech was John Brewer, 
    who worked his way up from an opening mile in 4:53 to finish a very respectable 
    42nd with a personal best of 25:47. Eric Khatchadourian, unable to hang on 
    to Brewer's trail, fell back a lot in the final two miles, but did manage 
    to hold onto 77th place. Fivos Constantinou continued to improve and return 
    to his competitive level he enjoyed as a high schooler back in Cyprus. Constantinou 
    moved up from his conservative start to finish fourth, just ahead of struggling 
    Carlos Renjifo. The :38 delta enjoyed by MIT's top four runners last week 
    expanded to an unacceptable 1:15, a level that is unlikely to get them to 
    nationals and certainly will not achieve much at nationals if they do make 
    it. Also running varsity for MIT were freshman Chris Bruce and sophomore Kevin 
    Brulois.</p>
  <p align="left">In the sub-varsity race, MIT placed seventh overall and second 
    among Division III colleges. Led by senior Ian Driver, Tech had a :41 delta 
    through six men. Also placing for the Engineers were freshman Chris Wong, 
    sophomore Kevin DiGenova, and freshmen Martin Holmes and Erik Stafl. MIT's 
    depth may prove vital in the weeks to come as they seek to reach their potential.</p>
  <p align="left">Next Saturday, MIT travels to Cumberland, Maine to race at the 
    Twin Brook Ivitational that will be held at the recreation park. Many of the 
    top New England Division III teams are expected to be at the site of the NCAA 
    New England Regional Qualifier.</p>
