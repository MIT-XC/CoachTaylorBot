  <p align="left">September 4, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">The 2004 cross country season opened Saturday with the annual 
    alumni meet at Franklin Park. Despite a large turnout from the &quot;Has Beens&quot; 
    and the benefit of age graded scoring, the varsity proved superior on this 
    particular day, winning the meet with a 22-40 score. Sean Nolan, '02, led 
    the way with an individual victory and a time of 25:47 on a windy but cool 
    70 degree day.</p>
  <p align="left">The race time temperature dropped over 10 degrees in the hour 
    before the start, making for near ideal early season conditions. The Varsity 
    followed the race plan for a well paced but conservative start and the Alumni 
    followed, patient to let the youngsters do the work. The Varsity proved to 
    be too strong as they pulled away and opened a large gap after two miles. 
    Terry McNatt '87 and Craig Wildman '02 kept pace at the rear of the second 
    pack but were not threatening the top five. Up front, Erik Khatchadourian 
    and Nolan were doing battle with Khatchadourian opening up a small lead in 
    the second mile.</p>
  <p align="left">At the end of the third mile, Nolan took the lead for good and 
    began accelerating for the final two miles. McNatt and Wildman trailed the 
    varsity's seventh man. Bob Collins, '82, trailed Varsity's tenth man but would 
    gain significant time with the age grading system. Ethan Crain '95, Brian 
    Anderson '04, Bob Zak '84, Sumner Brown '66, Liyan Guo '01, John Biesiadecki 
    '02 and Jeff Lucas '82, running near the rear of the race, were game competitors 
    but were fighting age and the ability to train successfully years after college.</p>
  <p align="left">Things changed very little in the final two miles. Nolan won 
    by :19 over Khatchadourian and the varsity put in seven runners in :43. Sumner 
    Brown, 60 years young, benefitted nearly six minutes from the age graded scoring, 
    placing fifth overall. Bob Collins placed ninth overall, gaining almost a 
    minute on his original time of 27:45. McNatt finished 11th overall just ahead 
    of teammate Wildman to round out the Alumni scoring. Even though the scoring 
    seemed lopsided, the fact that the Alumni placed five runners among the top 
    twelve overall shows how hard these guys continue to train.</p>
