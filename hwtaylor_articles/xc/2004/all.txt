    September 4, 2004
    
    
      
    
    The 2004 cross country season opened Saturday with the annual 
        alumni meet at Franklin Park. Despite a large turnout from the "Has Beens" 
        and the benefit of age graded scoring, the varsity proved superior on this 
        particular day, winning the meet with a 22-40 score. Sean Nolan, '02, led 
        the way with an individual victory and a time of 25:47 on a windy but cool 
        70 degree day.
    
    
      
    
    The race time temperature dropped over 10 degrees in the hour 
        before the start, making for near ideal early season conditions. The Varsity 
        followed the race plan for a well paced but conservative start and the Alumni 
        followed, patient to let the youngsters do the work. The Varsity proved to 
        be too strong as they pulled away and opened a large gap after two miles. 
        Terry McNatt '87 and Craig Wildman '02 kept pace at the rear of the second 
        pack but were not threatening the top five. Up front, Erik Khatchadourian 
        and Nolan were doing battle with Khatchadourian opening up a small lead in 
        the second mile.
    
    
      
    
    At the end of the third mile, Nolan took the lead for good and 
        began accelerating for the final two miles. McNatt and Wildman trailed the 
        varsity's seventh man. Bob Collins, '82, trailed Varsity's tenth man but would 
        gain significant time with the age grading system. Ethan Crain '95, Brian 
        Anderson '04, Bob Zak '84, Sumner Brown '66, Liyan Guo '01, John Biesiadecki 
        '02 and Jeff Lucas '82, running near the rear of the race, were game competitors 
        but were fighting age and the ability to train successfully years after college.
    
    
      
    
    Things changed very little in the final two miles. Nolan won 
        by :19 over Khatchadourian and the varsity put in seven runners in :43. Sumner 
        Brown, 60 years young, benefitted nearly six minutes from the age graded scoring, 
        placing fifth overall. Bob Collins placed ninth overall, gaining almost a 
        minute on his original time of 27:45. McNatt finished 11th overall just ahead 
        of teammate Wildman to round out the Alumni scoring. Even though the scoring 
        seemed lopsided, the fact that the Alumni placed five runners among the top 
        twelve overall shows how hard these guys continue to train.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT travels to Troy, NY to RPI, the host of the annual 
        Engineer's Cup.

    **MIT SWEEPS UP AT ENGINEER'S CUP**
    
    
      
    
    September 11, 2004
    
    
      
    
    MIT shuffled their top seven runners on Saturday but the results 
        were the same, an easy victory led by a seven man sweep for a perfect score 
        of 15 to 55 for host RPI and 78 for WPI. MIT swept for the second consecutive 
        year and have not lost since the early 90's.
    
    
      
    
    John Brewer and Eric Khatchadourian took the lead early in the 
        race and never relinquished it. Running together through three and three quarter 
        miles, Brewer pulled away slightly going up the final hill at the end of the 
        fourth mile as he went for his first MIT cross country victory in a time of 
        26:52, the fastest time ever run there by an MIT runner. Khatchadourian followed 
        closely in 26:56 for second place. A good pack ensued with MIT runners claiming 
        nine of the first ten spots. The pack was led by Carlos Renjifo (27:23) in 
        third, Chris Bruce (27:36) in fourth, Spencer Dudley (27:41) in fifth, Erik 
        Stafl (27:47) in sixth, Chris Wong (27:48) in seventh, Ian Driver (27:54) 
        in ninth and Kevin DiGenova (27:56) in tenth. MIT's Ben Schmeckpeper took 
        the week off from racing for training purposes and Kevin Brulois did not race 
        due to the stomach flu he contracted on Friday.
    
    
      
    
    After the second mile it appeared obvious that MIT would sweep, 
        but a few RPI runners were still ahead of MIT's next pack of four runners. 
        At the end of three miles this pack of four made a strong move, passing all 
        but one WPI runner. In the final mile, when the pack finally spread out a 
        little, Stafl and Wong moved up to complete the seven man sweep.
    
    
      
    
    The warm temperatures, sharp turns and hills all contributed 
        to make this course much slower than the one at Franklin Park. Nevertheless, 
        Stafl, Driver and Steve Nicholson all ran faster than they did the week before 
        on the faster course.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT travels to UMass Dartmouth to race in their invitational. 
        The UMass Dartmouth course, known for being flat and fast, will be approximately 
        120 meters short due to some construction that will force runners to run on 
        pavement and abandon the use of spikes. This will be Tech's first opportunity 
        to see some of the better teams in the region as well as the first race with 
        a large field.

    **SCHMECKPEPER ENDS COLLEGIATE CROSS COUNTRY CAREER 
        WITH EIGHTH PLACE FINISH AT NATIONALS**
    
    
      
    
    November 20, 2004
    
    
      
    
    Bringing a fitting climax to a spectacular collegiate career 
        in the sport of cross country, Ben Schmeckpeper made the best of his fourth 
        consecutive NCAA Division III Championship opportunity by finishing in eighth 
        place with a time 24:49, earning his second All America Award.
    
    
      
    
    The NCAA Division III Regional Male Runner of the Year, Schmeckpeper, 
        a Wisconsin native from Shorewood, thought he could make a run for the individual 
        title here at the White Tail Golf Course in Colfax, Wisconsin. The meet, hosted 
        by the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, began with temperatures in the 
        upper 30's and a brisk wind swirling around the course. The favorite to win, 
        defending champion Josh Moen of Wartburg College, wasted no time in taking 
        command of the race. Shortly after the mile mark, Moen gapped the field. Schmeckpeper 
        and a couple of others made the attempt to get back with Moen, but he made 
        a second surge and no one ever made up the difference.
    
    
      
    
    Schmeckpeper made the effort to gradually get back to the leader, 
        and in the process left himself vulnerable to the small pack that was content 
        with racing for second place. Last year's runner up, Macharia Yuot of Widener 
        College, was the only one to come close to Moen, closing the gap to within 
        20 meters at three and a half miles into the race. Shortly after that, he 
        paid the price, eventually falling back to 24th place. Schmeckpeper also paid 
        the price, falling from third place at the three mile mark to 11th place just 
        before the four mile mark. The last mile, a gradual hill going up for approximately 
        a half mile, followed by a gradual downhill to the finish, challenged Schmeckpeper 
        not to fall back and to continue to fight for one of the top spots.
    
    
      
    
    Just as he refused to end his cross country career without going 
        for the individual title, Schmeckpeper refused to give up without putting 
        every ounce of effort into his final race. Coming into the finish Schmeckpeper 
        moved up to eighth place and held it to match the second highest NCAA finish 
        by an MIT individual (Jesse Darley '95) in the past 20 years. Only Dan Feldman 
        in 2001, who finished in fourth, has finished higher in this illustrious race.
    
    
      
    
    After some time of getting his base mileage back, Schmeckpeper 
        is looking forward to his final indoor and outdoor track seasons where he 
        hopes to match this years cross country success.

    **SCHMECKPEPER DEFENDS NCAA REGIONAL TITLE**
    
    
      
    
    **Not Enough to Lead Team to Nationals**
    
    
      
    
    November 13, 2004
    
    
      
    
    Ben Schmeckpeper ran the race of his career, at least thus far, 
        as he defended his NCAA Regional / New England Division III Championship title 
        at the Twin Brook Recreation Area on the 8K course. Despite the freezing temperatures 
        and brisk wind the times were fast. Schmeckpeper worked his way up to the 
        leaders during the second mile and turned a modest pace (10:39 at two miles) 
        into a very fast one as he ran 14:58 over the final three miles on a very 
        hilly course to finish in 25:37.
    
    
      
    
    Despite his best efforts, it was not enough to help the Engineers 
        qualify for the National Championship. Needing to place among the top four 
        teams out of the 39 complete squads racing, the plan was to respect the hilly 
        course and go out somewhat conservatively. The mistake made by the main group 
        of MIT runners was how conservatively they ran the first mile, and that was 
        unfortunately much too slow. Hoping to finish among the top 30 runners, John 
        Brewer, Eric Khatchadourian, Carlos Renjifo, Fivos Constantinou and Kevin 
        Brulois hoped to hit the first mile in 5:25, which would have put them in 
        a perfect 40th-50th position. Brewer ran aggressively and started fast, coming 
        through the mile mark in 5:20. Khatchadourian, Renjifo, Constantinou, Brulois, 
        with freshman Chris Bruce following, came through the mile in 5:45, which 
        put them at around 120th position at that point in the race.
    
    
      
    
    Despite their desire to move up and accomplish their goal, it 
        was too much to do with not enough time to do it in. Brewer held on to his 
        position throughout the race and finished 23rd in a very respectable 26:48. 
        Renjifo eventually moved up to 49th in 27:26. Brulois closed hard to place 
        57th in 27:35. Constantinou finished the scoring in 60th position in 27:39. 
      
    
    
      
    
    Tufts University ran the race they expected to and won quite 
        easily with 62 points. Williams College ran a superb race, coming closer than 
        expected to Tufts, scoring 83 points. Keene State ran well to place third 
        with 112 points. Bates College perhaps ran the best race of all when they 
        placed fourth with 145 points despite not having one of their top five runners, 
        who was out with a stress fracture. Wesleyan took advantage of MIT's poor 
        showing, beating them for fifth place by one point, 189 to 190.
    
    
      
    
    Once Schmeckpeper decided to take control of things he threw 
        in what should have been a devastating third mile in 5:06. The third mile 
        is the hilliest one on the course and the pace was hard enough to make most 
        doubt their ability to finish. However, while the pace certainly strung things 
        out, it appeared an unusual number of competitors were in it for the long 
        haul. The fourth mile, a winding, hilly mile itself, was hammered in 5:02 
        by Schmeckpeper. This effort took care of all but one runner, Neal Holtschulte 
        of Williams College. Holtschulte, an All America runner who had placed sixth 
        at last year's NCAA Championship was not going to be shaken. Schmeckpeper 
        dropped a 4:50 final mile and still the race was neck and neck coming down 
        the final downhill straight with each runner taking turns at the lead. As 
        the runners came within sight of the finish line, Holtschulte took a one step 
        lead. Schmeckpeper, not known for his kicking ability, found the passion and 
        desire to overtake Holtschulte in the final fifty meters to win by two seconds.
    
    
      
    
    Next Saturday, Schmeckpeper and the other qualifiers will converge 
        at the White Tail Golf Course in Colfax, Wisconsin to race in the NCAA Division 
        III Championship, hosted by the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire. Schmeckpeper, 
        an All America runner two years ago, narrowly missed last year and hopes to 
        atone for that and be among the top finishers in this year's championship.

    **HARRIERS PLACE 11TH IN ALL NEW ENGLANDS DESPITE DISMAL 
        PERFORMANCES**
    
    
      
    
    October 8, 2004
    
    
      
    
    The MIT men's cross country team managed an 11th place finish 
        at Franklin Park in this annual championship amongst all of the colleges in 
        New England, regardless of their NCAA division affiliation, despite poor races 
        by many of the team members. More important than the 11th place finish among 
        all the teams was the third place finish among Division III teams. MIT, with 
        319 points was only three points behind Williams College, but also only four 
        points ahead of Bates College. Tufts, the favorite among Division III schools 
        to take the regional qualifier in five weeks, ran well and placed sixth overall.
    
    
      
    
    MIT runners could find many excuses, such as the 75 degree temperatures 
        and the fact that they had worked through the meet with two hard workouts 
        during the week, or even that some had had as many as four exams during the 
        week and some as late as the morning of the race. However, none was a justifiable 
        excuse for the majority who did not have enough passion to work through the 
        pain. Coach Halston Taylor claims his team is good enough to compete much 
        better than they exhibited on this day.
    
    
      
    
    Leading the way for the Engineers was Ben Schmeckpeper, who 
        was hampered earlier in the season with an iron deficiency and is just now 
        getting to the point of working on good quality in practices. Schmeckpeper 
        went out in the back of the lead pack and managed to hold on for a 17th place 
        and a finish of 25:17 on a day when times were affected by at least 30 seconds 
        due to the high temperatures. Running the best race for Tech was John Brewer, 
        who worked his way up from an opening mile in 4:53 to finish a very respectable 
        42nd with a personal best of 25:47. Eric Khatchadourian, unable to hang on 
        to Brewer's trail, fell back a lot in the final two miles, but did manage 
        to hold onto 77th place. Fivos Constantinou continued to improve and return 
        to his competitive level he enjoyed as a high schooler back in Cyprus. Constantinou 
        moved up from his conservative start to finish fourth, just ahead of struggling 
        Carlos Renjifo. The :38 delta enjoyed by MIT's top four runners last week 
        expanded to an unacceptable 1:15, a level that is unlikely to get them to 
        nationals and certainly will not achieve much at nationals if they do make 
        it. Also running varsity for MIT were freshman Chris Bruce and sophomore Kevin 
        Brulois.
    
    
      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, MIT placed seventh overall and second 
        among Division III colleges. Led by senior Ian Driver, Tech had a :41 delta 
        through six men. Also placing for the Engineers were freshman Chris Wong, 
        sophomore Kevin DiGenova, and freshmen Martin Holmes and Erik Stafl. MIT's 
        depth may prove vital in the weeks to come as they seek to reach their potential.
    
    
      
    
    Next Saturday, MIT travels to Cumberland, Maine to race at the 
        Twin Brook Ivitational that will be held at the recreation park. Many of the 
        top New England Division III teams are expected to be at the site of the NCAA 
        New England Regional Qualifier.

    October 30, 2004
    
    
      
    
    Ben Schmeckpeper tood the lead from defending champion, Stan 
        Pyle of Wheaton College, just after two miles of the five mile race and never 
        looked back, winning by 47 seconds in a time of 25:07 on the wet course. Schmeckpeper's 
        victory led MIT to their seventh consecutive NEWMAC Championship, making them 
        the only team to ever take the traveling trophy home. MIT secured fourth through 
        eighth places, giving them six in the top eight for a low score of 23 points. 
        Coast Guard was second with 52 points, Springfield was third with 87, Wheaton 
        claimed fourth with 100, WPI raced to fifth with 129, Babson managed sixth 
        place with 166 and Clark rounded out the scoring by finishing seventh with 
        198 points.
    
    
      
    
    With a light mist falling, the seventh annual NEWMAC Cross Country 
        Championship was off and running. Pyle took off with a strategy that appeared 
        as though he wanted to run away with the race in the first mile, hoping no 
        one would go with him as he covered the first mile in 4:48. Schmeckpeper, 
        coming around to championship form, was undaunted by the pace. The two of 
        them opened up a fourteen second lead by the mile and :36 by the two mile. 
        The battle for third place was waging between Mike Flint of Coast Guard and 
        John Brewer of MIT, who had separated themselves from the trailing pack by 
        four seconds at the mile mark.
    
    
      
    
    The pack, led by Coast Guard and WPI runners went out fast relative 
        to previous performances. With the exception of Schmeckpeper and Brewer and 
        a slightly ambitious Eric Khatchadourian, who was running in the front of 
        the pack, the MIT runners were content to trail the pack and follow their 
        plan. By the second mile mark MIT had established a dominant position in the 
        pack but both Coast Guard and WPI were still in the race. At three miles, 
        MIT was in firm control and it was obvious that the other teams were falling 
        back. Schmeckpeper had a 50 meter lead by this point, Flint had started to 
        pull away from Brewer and MIT had taken over the top 10 with five runners 
        within two seconds of each other.
    
    
      
    
    In the final loop the trends continued with few changes taking 
        place. While MIT had a very large delta between Schmeckpeper and their pack 
        of runners, the pack itself finished within :15 of each other. The question 
        to be answered; is Schmeckpeper that much better than the other runners in 
        New England that the MIT pack will be with the contenders for a national berth 
        in two weeks. 
    
    
      
    
    There appear to be five teams vying for four national spots, 
        although there are 60 eligible teams in New England. Favored Tufts seems to 
        be a clear cut favorite. Williams, Keene State and MIT are running well and 
        appear to have similiar teams and chances. Bates, thought to have the most 
        talent at the beginning of the season, does not seem to be running very well 
        right now. The New England Division III Championship / NCAA Division III National 
        Qualifier will be held on November 13 at 11:00 on the Twin Brook Recreation 
        Park in Cumberland, Maine.

    For the second race in a row the weather was less than favorable 
        for good racing performances. Ben Schmeckpeper fought the cold rain and high 
        winds to place third in the Pre-national meet at the Whitetail Golf Course, 
        hosted by UW Eau Claire and led MIT to a third place team finish with 103 
        points.
    
    
      
    
    Schmeckpeper moved to the front of the pack at the beginning 
        of the race, working through the first mile conservatively in 5:06. By mile 
        two, the lead group of four, including Schmeckpeper, had separated themselves 
        from the rest of the field. The eventual winner, Dan Winder of Loras College 
        pulled away in the third mile but the other three slugged it out to the finish 
        with Schmeckpeper finishing in the middle in 25:49.
    
    
      
    
    John Brewer and Eric Khatchadourian also ran a conservative 
        first mile in 5:12, running off the second pack of runners, which included 
        a group of runners from UW Lacrosse, St. Olaf and Nebraska Wesleyan. They 
        gradually moved up in the pack and made up significant ground in the latter 
        half of the race. Brewer finished in 13th place, only 20 seconds behind Schmeckpeper. 
        Khatchadourian followed five places and seven seconds back.
    
    
      
    
    Just behind Brewer and Khatchadourian were Carlos Renjifo and 
        Kevin Brulois. Renjifo ran a superb first two miles before falling a little 
        off the pace while trying to encourage Brulois to stay up. He nevertheless 
        finished strong over the final two miles to place 26th, only 38 seconds behind 
        Schmeckpeper. Brulois, looking good through two miles, faded badly as he felt 
        the effects of his lack of sleep during the week. Normally only 20+ seconds 
        behind the lead MIT runner, Brulois finished 1:23 behind.
    
    
      
    
    Running a great race, particularly for only his second race 
        of the season, was Fivos Constantinou. Running a 5:23 first mile and 5:17 
        second mile. He did lose a little focus on the third mile, but finished strong 
        to end up as MIT's fifth man, passing Brulois in the final mile. MIT was only 
        three points behind winner St. Olaf through their first four runners, but 
        the 45th place by MIT for their fifth man did them in, putting them 18 points 
        behind St. Olaf and one point behind UW Lacrosse.
    
    
      
    
    Also running for MIT were freshmen Chris Wong, Chris Bruce and 
        sophomore Spencer Dudley. Wong ran an outstanding race, running a strong, 
        even pace for his best race of the season. Wong finished as MIT's seventh 
        man.
    
    
      
    
    Next Friday, MIT is at home at Franklin Park to run in the All 
        New Englands, a championship that involves all divisions of NCAA schools in 
        the New England region. The varsity gun goes off at 1:00 and the sub-varsity 
        starts at 1:45.

    **MIT FADES IN FINAL MILE**
    
    
      
    
    **Holds on for Third in Twin Brook Invitational**
    
    
      
    
    Although Keene State ran an incredibly aggressive race and Tufts 
        took it easy, pacing their top seven runners in a pack, MIT was unable to 
        take advantage of either situation. Keene State took the victory in the twelve 
        team field with 49 points. Tufts literally ran together in a seven man line 
        and totalled 70 points for second place. MIT finished with 77 points, 25 points 
        ahead of fourth place, NEWMAC rival, Coast Guard.
    
    
      
    
    M IT, determined to make up for their end of race fade in the 
        All New England Championship, ran in small groups well and for four miles 
        of the five mile race looked to be setting up for the win on the muddy course. 
        However, just as John Brewer moved into second place ahead of Mike Flint of 
        Coast Guard, Eric Khatchadourian was poised to pass Joseph Hegarty of Keene 
        State to move into fourth and Kevin Brulois had passed the group from Tufts 
        and joined Carlos Renjifo, only four seconds behind Ryan Gough of Keene State, 
        their third man at the time, MIT seemed to run out of gas. Brewer, running 
        a very gutsy race as he becomes accustomed to being able to run up in the 
        front of big races, could not win the battle with Flint and was also passed 
        by Dan Crespin from Brandeis, who had come from :17 down at the four mile 
        mark. Khatchadourian succeeded in passing Gough, finishing off a strong race. 
        Both Brulois and Renjifo faded badly, not only were they unable to make the 
        move on Keene State but lost twenty places between the two of them in the 
        final mile.
    
    
      
    
    Although they are obviously trying their best, MIT still seems 
        to be having difficulty finding a consistent fifth man. On this particular 
        day the Engineers held out number one runner Ben Schmeckpeper, which certainly 
        would have made a difference in the outcome of the race. However, while Brulois 
        re-joined the top five, Fivos Constantinou suffered a set back as he lost 
        focus, on this very difficult course, during the third and fourth miles. Freshman 
        Chris Bruce has been relatively solid but unable to make the leap to within 
        one minute of the lead MIT runner. The delta of 1:13 for their 1-5 runners 
        was not very good, particularly with Schmeckpeper not in the race.
    
    
      
    
    MIT heads to Waterford, Connecticut in two weeks to attempt 
        to retain their NEWMAC team title, which they have won all six years the conference 
        has been in existence. The race will take place at Harkness Memorial State 
        Park at 11:00 AM.

    **MIT RUNS THROUGH RAIN SOAKED COURSE FOR 3RD PLACE**
    
    
      
    
    September 18, 2004
    
    
      
    
    The MIT Engineers visited UMass Dartmouth for their annual invitational 
        with hopes of measuring their position within the ranks of New England's best 
        Division three teams. What they got was a third place finish against a good 
        field of 29 teams and a lesson on running through the final punch of hurricane 
        Ivan.
    
    
      
    
    Despite the deluge that brought nearly five inches of rain, 
        John Brewer went out with the lead group of runners, outside of the leading 
        Japanese national team who were not involved in the team scoring. Brewer went 
        out a little fast, but was still able to hold on for a personal best of 25:53, 
        breaking twenty six minutes for the first time. Once the fourth mile started 
        the lead runners were able to pull away from a fatiguing Brewer but no one 
        from the chase group was able to catch him.
    
    
      
    
    While the fast start helped Brewer achieve his place and time, 
        it served to break up the group plan and left Eric Khatchadourian and Carlos 
        Renjifo to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, Bates College, a team whose 
        time has come, took a page out of the MIT book and performed group running 
        to perfection. A trio of Bobcats ran together, catching three MIT runners 
        in the final two miles to lead Bates to victory. Not only did MIT's lead group 
        break up at the beginning but the second group never even formed. Kevin Brulois 
        ran a competitive race but may have also started too hard. This strung out 
        his group of Chris Bruce, Spencer Dudley and Chris Wong.
    
    
      
    
    Brown University started out in front, depending on their front 
        running style to deliver a second place finish as Bates College ran down their 
        fatiguing runners in the final miles. Tufts University, the defending New 
        England Division III champions, only ran two of their varsity runners and 
        placed eigth.
    
    
      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, which preceded the varsity race, Fivos 
        Constantinou returned to racing with a victory and a personal best time of 
        26:43. Constantinou ran a very conservative start and had plenty left to catch 
        the leaders as he made up over 100 meters in the final mile and a half. Two 
        of those he walked down were teammates Kevin DiGenova and Erik Stafl who had 
        fought the entire race trying to take the lead. DiGenova and Stafl place third 
        and fourth respectively in the team running to help MIT to a big victory with 
        27 points to 41 to Bates. Also running a great race for MIT was Martin Holmes, 
        knocking 50 seconds off his personal best in his seventh place finish.
    
    
      
    
    After taking next weekend off from racing, MIT will travel to 
        the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire to race Pre-Nationals on Friday, October 
        1, the site of the NCAA Division III Championships. Ben Schmeckpeper, All 
        America runner and defending New England Division III champion will return 
        to racing at this meet, which should give MIT a true evaluation of their national 
        ranking.
