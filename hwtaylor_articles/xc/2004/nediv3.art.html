  <p><strong><font size="+3">SCHMECKPEPER DEFENDS NCAA REGIONAL TITLE</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="+3">Not Enough to Lead Team to Nationals</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">November 13, 2004</p>
  <p align="left">Ben Schmeckpeper ran the race of his career, at least thus far, 
    as he defended his NCAA Regional / New England Division III Championship title 
    at the Twin Brook Recreation Area on the 8K course. Despite the freezing temperatures 
    and brisk wind the times were fast. Schmeckpeper worked his way up to the 
    leaders during the second mile and turned a modest pace (10:39 at two miles) 
    into a very fast one as he ran 14:58 over the final three miles on a very 
    hilly course to finish in 25:37.</p>
  <p align="left">Despite his best efforts, it was not enough to help the Engineers 
    qualify for the National Championship. Needing to place among the top four 
    teams out of the 39 complete squads racing, the plan was to respect the hilly 
    course and go out somewhat conservatively. The mistake made by the main group 
    of MIT runners was how conservatively they ran the first mile, and that was 
    unfortunately much too slow. Hoping to finish among the top 30 runners, John 
    Brewer, Eric Khatchadourian, Carlos Renjifo, Fivos Constantinou and Kevin 
    Brulois hoped to hit the first mile in 5:25, which would have put them in 
    a perfect 40th-50th position. Brewer ran aggressively and started fast, coming 
    through the mile mark in 5:20. Khatchadourian, Renjifo, Constantinou, Brulois, 
    with freshman Chris Bruce following, came through the mile in 5:45, which 
    put them at around 120th position at that point in the race.</p>
  <p align="left">Despite their desire to move up and accomplish their goal, it 
    was too much to do with not enough time to do it in. Brewer held on to his 
    position throughout the race and finished 23rd in a very respectable 26:48. 
    Renjifo eventually moved up to 49th in 27:26. Brulois closed hard to place 
    57th in 27:35. Constantinou finished the scoring in 60th position in 27:39.

  <p align="left">Tufts University ran the race they expected to and won quite 
    easily with 62 points. Williams College ran a superb race, coming closer than 
    expected to Tufts, scoring 83 points. Keene State ran well to place third 
    with 112 points. Bates College perhaps ran the best race of all when they 
    placed fourth with 145 points despite not having one of their top five runners, 
    who was out with a stress fracture. Wesleyan took advantage of MIT's poor 
    showing, beating them for fifth place by one point, 189 to 190.</p>
  <p align="left">Once Schmeckpeper decided to take control of things he threw 
    in what should have been a devastating third mile in 5:06. The third mile 
    is the hilliest one on the course and the pace was hard enough to make most 
    doubt their ability to finish. However, while the pace certainly strung things 
    out, it appeared an unusual number of competitors were in it for the long 
    haul. The fourth mile, a winding, hilly mile itself, was hammered in 5:02 
    by Schmeckpeper. This effort took care of all but one runner, Neal Holtschulte 
    of Williams College. Holtschulte, an All America runner who had placed sixth 
    at last year's NCAA Championship was not going to be shaken. Schmeckpeper 
    dropped a 4:50 final mile and still the race was neck and neck coming down 
    the final downhill straight with each runner taking turns at the lead. As 
    the runners came within sight of the finish line, Holtschulte took a one step 
    lead. Schmeckpeper, not known for his kicking ability, found the passion and 
    desire to overtake Holtschulte in the final fifty meters to win by two seconds.</p>
  <p align="left">Next Saturday, Schmeckpeper and the other qualifiers will converge 
    at the White Tail Golf Course in Colfax, Wisconsin to race in the NCAA Division 
    III Championship, hosted by the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire. Schmeckpeper, 
    an All America runner two years ago, narrowly missed last year and hopes to 
    atone for that and be among the top finishers in this year's championship.</p>
