    Men and Women Dominate Alumni Meet
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                      
    
    September 2, 2016
    
    
                      
    
    Although a few individuals came into the pre-season with injuries sustained over the summer, the Engineers appear deep enough to weather the storm.  The men's and women's Alumni -Varsity races were 5K's (actually 3.2) held at historic Franklin Park on a sunny mid-70 degree day. The Engineers swept both races, winning by a score of 15 to 50 over the alumni in each race.
    
    
                      
    
    The nationally 7th ranked women raced first.  Megan McCandless '20 and Jenna Melanson '20 wasted no time taking control of the pace.  Although a little too fast, the freshman duo had a comfortable lead at the mile mark as they came through in 5:37.  Leandra Zimmermann '19 and Mary Eccles '18 working together were :14 back in third and fourth.  The alums, either out of race shape, or recovering from recent longer races, were more towards the back of the pack.
    
    
                      
    
    McCandless opened up a :22 second lead on Melanson in the second mile as she attacked the major hill on the course to maintain her race effort.  Zimmermann and Eccles were now :12 behind Melanson, and Katie Bacher '20, Jenny Xu '19, Marissa McPhillips '20 and Bailee Margolis '19 were another :15 back with no alums in front of them.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final 1.2 miles, McCandless continued to widen the gap, eventually winning in 18:10 with a :50 lead.  Melanson outkicked Zimmermann and Eccles as they ran 19:00, 19:00 and 19:06 respectively.  Bacher closed out the scoring with a 19:12.  Xu was also timed in 19:12 and McPhillips was 19:18.
    
    
                      
    
    Alina Gatowski '11 led the Alumnae with a 20:01 performance in 9th place.  Louise van den Heuvel '14 finished in 11th place in 20:05, just ahead of Nicole Zeinstra '16, also timed in 20:05.  Brooke Johnson '13 placed 16th in 20:37 and Alexandra Taylor '14 placed 19th in 21:57 to close out the scoring.  Maggie Lloyd '12 and Stephanie Marzen '15 were the final alumnae competitors in 22:16 and 22:38 respectively.
    
    
                      
    
    The nationally 7th ranked men raced second.  Similar to the women, the alums took a cautious approach to the race.  Dennis Maloney '19 wasted no time getting out front.  At the mile mark, Matt Deyo 'G joined him at 4:44.  Josh Derrick '20 and Ben Freed '18 were very close at 4:46 with Daniel Weiss '19 one second back.  
    
    
                      
    
    At the end of the second mile, Maloney had separated himself from the pack at 9:58, a four second lead over Deyo, Derrick and Freed.  Weiss fell back to 10:10 as Steven Goldy '20 moved past him at 10:07.  Tech had seven more runners between 10:12 and 10:22, showing their depth.
    
    
                      
    
    Maloney allegedly made a wrong turn somewhere allowing the gap to close in the final mile.  Nevertheless he maintained his lead to the end, winning in 15:45.  Deyo did his best to close, finishing in second at 15:47.  Derrick was third in 15:49 and Freed fourth at 15:54.  Goldy was unable to close the gap over the last mile, but did not lose much either, finishing fifth in 16:01.  A 12 second gap separated Goldy from the sixth man, Alex Knoedler '18. David Walter '18 was seventh at 16:16 and Colin Godwin '17 was eighth at 16:18.  Freshman Nate Foss '20 was one second back.
    
    
                      
    
    The alums top finisher was Benji Xie '15, who finished 17th overall in 16:52.  Roy Wedge '14 was 19th at 17:41, while Matt Jordan '15 was 20th in 17:48.  The remaining alums were Logan Trimble '13 in 18:11, Eric Khatchadourian '06 in 18:37, Joe Roy-Mayhew '08 in 19:26 and Bob Collins '82 in 21:03.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT will not be back in action until September 24 when they race in the Purple Valley Classic at Williams College where many nationally ranked teams will do battle over the hilly 6K and 8K courses.

    Men and Women Both Finish 2nd in Border Battle 
    
    
                      
    
    October 15, 2016
    
    
                      
    
    MIT traveled to Rowan University in Glassboro, NJ for the weekend to compete in the annual Border Battle cross country race.  Both the men's and women's races had numerous nationally ranked teams. In the women's race, #1 ranked SUNY Geneseo, #2 ranked MIT, #4 ranked Johns Hopkins, and nine other teams ranked between 11th and 30th among the 45 total teams would do battle. On the men's side, #1 ranked SUNY Geneseo, #5 MIT, #11 RPI and eight more teams ranked between 13th and 34th among the 43 total teams would see who was the best.
    
    
                      
    
    Both the men and women finished second for MIT, however, the races could not have been more different.  The women were set to race first on the very flat 6K course with temperatures in the upper 60's with bright sunshine.  The ground was hard so there was no question the pace would be fast, and Amy Regan was there to guarantee that.  Winning four national titles last year (3K, 5K indoors and 5K, 10K outdoors), the 2014 cross country champion likes to take the pace out very hard to totally discourage her competition from going with her.  With an if it isn't broken, don't fix it mentality that is exactly what she did.  The downhill start got her going as she hammered the first mile in 5:08.  MIT's Megan McCandless '20 was trying to get up to her, but by the mile was still back four seconds in 5:12 and in third place.  While this was going on up front, Johns Hopkins entire team was near the front, taking everyone by surprise.  The glut of MIT runners were back at a quick 5:26 mile, but already out of the race for first.  Their original sights had been on SUNY Geneseo and that battle seemed to going well.
    
    
                      
    
    By the two mile mark, McCandless was 10 seconds behind Regan and still in third place at 10:50.  Maryann Gong '17 was leading the MIT pack at 11:17 with Katie Bacher '20 having a solid race in 11:21.  Leandra Zimmermann '19 was close behind in 11:23, but not having her usual race.  Mary Eccles '18 was at 11:24 trying to form the tandem with Zimmermann that worked so well in 2015.  Jenna Melanson '20, normally MIT's #2 runner was not having a good day, letting a reduced week of mileage get to her head as she hit 11:29.  Christina Wicker '17 and Jenny Xu '19 were back at 11:31 and 11:32 respectively.
    
    
                      
    
    Although MIT held steady with Geneseo for the final 1.73 miles, a lot of switching of positions took place.  McCandless finished in third in 20:44 for 5:34 pace per mile.  Gong was 16th in 21:20 showing she is on her way back.  Bacher ran 21:50, finishing in 36th and Zimmermann was in 38th in 21:54.  Xu moved up nearly 10 seconds on Bacher and Zimmermann in the final .73 for 42nd place.  Wicker also moved up well as she gets back in condition from her injury.  Melanson and Eccles went the other direction with Eccles developing a side stitch before the 4K mark.  
    
    
                      
    
    In the end, Johns Hopkins won easily with 70 points.  MIT squeaked by Geneseo 134 to 136 for second place.
    
    
                      
    
    The men also went out fast, dictated as much by the start as the talented field, but not as insanely fast as the women.  Matt Deyo 'G, Dennis Maloney '19, Daniel Weiss '19 and Josh Derrick '20 were up with the front pack at 4:36. Racing without #4 runner Colin Godwin '17 and #5 runner Steven Goldy '20 the pressure was on for someone to step up in this race. In the early going that honor was earned by Alex Knoedler '18 and Josh Rosenkranz '19 as they both came through in 4:41.
    
    
                      
    
    Through three miles Deyo and Maloney were right up at the front at 14:11.  Weiss had fallen back a bit, but was still in it at 14:16.  Derrick was starting to fade (14:16) after thinking too much when he heard the two mile split of 9:32.  Knoedler began to pull away from Rosenkranz at 14:30 to 14:33.
    
    
                      
    
    The hope of defeating Geneseo was pretty much over after three miles, but MIT had a solid lead over the other teams.  In the final two miles the lead group broke up as Isaac Garcia-Cassani of Geneseo pulled away to win in 23:19.  Deyo finished in eighth despite a severe case of plantar fasciitis, running 23:42 on what was presumed to be a 7.8K distance.  Maloney was in ninth in 23:43.  Tech had a big gap of :38 seconds before Weiss came through in 24:21 in 29th place.  Derrick placed 34th in 24:24 and Knoedler came though just as he did last year at the end of the season, finishing in 47th in 24:36.  Nicholas Waltman '18 ran a 4:47 final mile to move up to sixth for MIT, placing 59th overall in 24:42. MIT scored 127 points to Geneseo's 71 to earn runner-up.  Third place went to RPI with 168 points.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT is off next weekend as they prepare for their NEWMAC Championship at Smith College on October 29.

    NCAA Championship Mixture of Outstanding and Poor Performances 
    
    
                      
    
    November 19, 2016
    
    
                      
    
    Coming off a pretty strong regional performance, and an outstanding week of practice, the Engineers appeared very ready for the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship hosted by Spalding University in Louisville, KY at the Tom Sawyer Park, at least Coach Halston Taylor so believed.  It seems that was indeed the case for a few individuals, but could not have been further from the truth for others.  Very poor preparation by the coach left many of the team members ill prepared, some physically and some mentally.  The women, seeded second in the country for most of the season, including going into this meet, finished in fifth place, two points off of the podium.  The men earned their best finish ever, placing seventh although they had been seeded third going into the meet.
    
    
                      
    
    The women, in box 41, may have been at a disadvantage, possibly running slightly farther to the first turn.  The teams with lower box numbers, for the women's and men's races seemed to be in front coming off the start. The higher box numbers were certainly at a disadvantage with regard to being on the far outside of the first turn, which was sharp enough to cause them to run quite a bit farther.
    
    
                      
    
    Regardless, at the 3K mark Tech was in 8th place with 339 points, while Johns Hopkins, who had been in box 34, was in first with 74 points.  Megan McCandless '20,  had moved up a lot from 28th at the mile mark to 12th after the two mile mark.  Unfortunately, the next closest MIT runners, Maryann Gong '17 and Christina Wicker '17, were right around 100th place. Interestingly, Wash U and Williams were 18th and 19th at the 3K with 449 and 469 points respectively.
    
    
                      
    
    Generally runners do not move up that much on a flat course when the pace is not that aggressive to start with by the leaders.  By the 3K, MIT had cut their score by about 100 points, coming in at 228 in third place, just ahead of quite a few teams, including Wash U, now in 6th with 278, and Williams in 8th with 294 points.  Meanwhile, Johns Hopkins had slipped slightly to 87 points.
    
    
                      
    
    This is where Coach Taylor failed to prepare his team.  Instead of realizing they were moving up and had a lot of room to go, it seemed that they had been frustrated they were not further ahead and appeared to lose hope and confidence.  They had not prepared for not getting out well and staying relaxed in the process of moving up.  The net result of this poor preparation was that the team basically stayed the same with 234 points.  Many of the other teams lost a lot of places, but not Wash U and Williams.  Wash U moved up to 202 points, good for second, while Williams moved up to 232 points, good for fourth.  Johns Hopkins maintained first although they dropped back a bit to 128 points.  SUNY Geneseo, had been in second the entire meet until the end when Wash U pushed them back to third with 214 points.  
    
    
                      
    
    McCandless finished in 17th, earning her first All America honor with her 21:04 performance and the highest finishing freshman.  Gong, who had finished 16th in 2015 was 64th in 21:43.  Wicker, a 2014 All American, who had finished 48th last year, was 79th in 21:46.  Leandra Zimmermann '19, who was 45th in 2015 as a freshman, placed 97th in 21:58.  Mary Eccles '18 closed out the scoring with her 22:05 in 122nd place after finishing  60th in 2015.  The confidence and attitude this team showed all season in 2014, and somewhat at this meet in 2015, was lacking all season.
    
    
                      
    
    The men were probably over-ranked at the end of the season.  Having lost three very good runners who were their 3-4-5 runners; Colin Godwin '16, Josh Derrick '20 and Steven Goldy '20, put the usual 7-8-9 runners into the position of being 4-5-6 runners.  In addition, with number one runner, Matt Deyo '16 being hit by a car a week ago, giving him a severe contusion at best and meniscus tear, or both at the worst, made the team very vulnerable.  Somehow, they never worried about what could have been.  Instead they stepped up and won the New England regional.
    
    
                      
    
    Now at Nationals, after seeing the women not get out well, and being on the other end of the starting line, they made sure to get out and put themselves in a position to succeed.  Deyo, who could only manage eight miles this week, and that was very painful, blocked out the pain and went out with the leaders, as did Dennis Maloney '19.  Rory Beyer '16, the number three runner, who had only been running for five weeks, also went out fast.  Daniel Weiss' '19 and Ben Freed '18 were also out pretty well at the mile mark, somewhere in the 40-60 range of front runners.  At the 2K, the Engineers were in the lead with 88 points to 94 for North Central.
    
    
                      
    
    Throughout the second and third mile, Deyo and Maloney were still among the top 15 runners and Beyer was in the top 25.  However, Freed had lost over 20 seconds to his front-running teammates and Weiss over 30 seconds.  By the 6.2K, MIT had slipped to third although they had actually reduced their score among the top three runners.  The problem was that the four and five runners had lost 98 points in the past 4K.
    
    
                      
    
    Bad got worse.  Deyo moved up in the final 2K, finishing seventh overall in an impressive 24:28.  Maloney slipped slightly to 12th in 24:39, the highest finishing freshman or sophomore.  Beyer lost some ground, finishing 43rd in 25:02, pretty remarkable for five weeks of running.  Overall, the trio lost eight points in the final 6K.  Freed was the fourth runner for Tech, finishing in 25:48 for 165th place and Alex Knoedler '18 closed out the scoring, running a well paced race to finish 192nd in 26:02.  MIT lost 205 points in the final 6K from the four and five runners.  To say the coaching was a failure is a severe understatement. The delta for one through five was the worst it had been all season at 1:34.
    
    
                      
    
    On the positive side, MIT finished with three All America winners.  The women finished among the top six teams in the country for the eighth consecutive year and the men earned their highest finish ever at the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship.  What could have been?
    
    
                      
    
    Graduating Gong, Wicker, Deyo, Beyer and Godwin, the Engineers will have to hope the preparation for some of those who fell short today will be good enough to move up next year.

    Tech Cross Country Claims Men's and Women's NCAA Division III New England Region Championship

    Entering the NCAA Division III New England Region Championship, the MIT women's team, ranked number two in the country, were favored to win by a small margin over Williams College and Tufts University, ranked number five and six respectively.  The men were ranked fifth whereas Williams was ranked third, although both teams had experienced recent losses.  Williams was racing without number one runner Peter Hale, while MIT was without number three man, Josh Derrick '20.  In addition, two days ago, number one runner, Matt Deyo 'G was hit by a car while riding his bike to class, injuring his knee and ankle in addition to some road rash.  The decision to race was made the morning of the event.  There was a lot of doubt, but if anyone could put the injuries and pain aside, it would be Deyo, who competed last year with a broken foot.
    
    
                      
    
    The women raced first.  After a fast start by a couple of runners who were no threat to win the title, the pace slowed.  MIT, running an aggressive race plan, ended up with six of their seven runners at the front, running abreast at 5:30 for the first mile, which may have been an inaccurate location as many of the mile marks seemed to be off for both genders.  The Engineers really did nothing with the race at this point, allowing the other teams to gather and recover.  By the time Megan McCandless decided to make a move after two miles, the field was ready for a 1.73 mile race with little to no fear of "dying".
    
    
                      
    
    McCandless opened up a lead on the field, pulling ahead of teammates Maryann Gong '17, Leandra Zimmermann '19 and Christina Wicker '17 by 14-16 seconds in the third mile.  Mary Eccles '18 was another eight seconds back with Katie Bacher '20.  Jenny Xu '19 sprained her ankle twice in the third mile  on the very rocky trails, putting her far behind.  Once they hit the field for the final 700 meters, McCandless still had the lead, but it was narrow.  In the final straight, Brittany Bowman '18 from Tufts pulled ahead, taking the victory by two seconds, 21:14 to 21:16. Zimmermann overtook Gong to place 11th and 12th in 21:38 and 21:40 respectively.  Williams was seventh, ninth and 10th, giving MIT a 25 to 26 lead through three runners. Wicker placed 18th to Williams 21st for their fourth finishers and Eccles lost by one to the Williams fifth runner, 24th place to 25th place to give Tech a three point victory, 68 to 71.  Tufts placed one, six, 14, 26 and 30 to total 77 points.
    
    
                      
    
    The men's race had an individual favorite, Tim Nichols '17 from Tufts University, but it was not clear if he would go for the victory right from the gun. MIT, hoping for an aggressive race, was hoping he would take it out.  Nichols did indeed go out hard, as did a few positive thinking opponents, who would later pay the price.  Deyo and Dennis Maloney '19 were in fifth and sixth at the mile mark at a crisp 4:35 as they positioned themselves in position to pick off those who went out with Nichols.  The rest of the MIT team were unable to find each other and work together.  Rory Beyer '17 was racing well at 4:40.  Daniel Weiss '19 was supposed to be with Beyer, but was three seconds behind.  Ben Freed '18 was at a respectable 4:45, but Nicholas Waltman '18 and Alex Knoedler '18 were back at 4:47 and 4:49 respectively.  Knoedler had fallen on the first straight, giving him a good excuse.
    
    
                      
    
    Not a lot changed for the top three as they came back onto the field for the second mile and then went back into the woods for the third mile.  Deyo and Maloney were still in fifth and sixth and Beyer was only six seconds back in about 12th.  Freed was moving up in the field even though he was 16 seconds behind Beyer at the two mile mark and :20 back at the three mile mark.  Knoedler had caught up to Waltman and Freed was closing in on Weiss who was falling back relative to his teammates.
    
    
                      
    
    The hilly fourth mile was a killer for Tech.  Deyo and Maloney had an excellent mile, separating themselves from the rest of their teammates by 12 to 27 seconds.  The delta was the worst it had been all season.  Granted, throughout the past five weeks the Engineers had lost their 3, 4, and 5 runners due to injury, forcing MIT to prove its depth. 
    
    
                      
    
    Deyo closed hard, moving into second place in 24:28.  Maloney also closed well, finishing in fourth in 24:33.  Beyer had a great race, running 25:03 for 13th.  At this point Williams had two runners across the line, finishing in sixth and 12th.  It seemed like an eternity before MIT put another runner across the finish, although it would only be 33 seconds.  During that wait, Williams put three more runners across at 28th, 29th and 35th to total 110 points.  Freed crossed the line in 43rd at 25:36 and Weiss in 48th at 25:42.  MIT had 19 points through three runners, but the 91 for four and five gave them 110.  The NCAA tie-breaker pairs the teams' individual runners against each other and the team that wins the majority of the top five battles wins the tie-breaker.  MIT's one, two and three runners beat the Williams top three runners in each head to head comparison even though Williams won the number four and five runner battles, giving MIT the victory.
    
    
                      
    
    It was a great day for MIT Cross Country.  It is the first time both genders won in the same year, which also marks the first time MIT has swept the New England Division III championships in Indoor Track & Field, Outdoor Track & Field and Cross Country for both genders in the same calendar year.
    
    
                      
    
    In one week, MIT will join 31 other teams to decide the NCAA Division III Championship in Louisville, Kentucky.  For MIT to make the podium both teams will have to do better, running closer to their potential.

    #### McCandless Places Fourth in Women's Race
    
    
                      
    
      
    
    
                      
    
    October 8, 2016
    
    
                      
    
    In just the second race of the season, MIT entered the Division I waters as they competed in the NEICAAA Championship.  The organization is comprised of the all the Division I, II and III teams in New England, hosting a championship in each of the three seasons (cross country, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field).  Not all of the teams enter the meet as there are many meets around the country various teams point to, and this particular championship is not a prerequisite for any other meet or championship.  This year, of the 35 teams racing 21 were Division I, eight were Division II and only six were Division III.  In the men's race, the quintet of Matt Deyo 'G, Josh Derrick '20, Dennis Maloney '19, Daniel Weiss '19 and Steven Goldy '20 scored a low total of 133 points to finish a historic third, 20 points behind Brown and 31 points behind Northeastern.  The women, led by freshman star Megan McCandless's fourth place individual finish, placed fifth for the second year in a row with 159 points, just two points behind Northeastern, seven behind Vermont, and 22 behind Harvard.  The winning team, New Hampshire, won easily with 71 points.  In both races MIT was easily the top Division III team.
    
    
                      
    
    The women's race was first on a day that offered a very dry course, but a mostly cloudy and very humid 70 degrees to make the performances slower than usual. The Engineers had a pretty solid start, but Katie Bacher '20 got a little carried away, sprinting across the field, opening up a 15 meter gap on her teammates.
    
    
                      
    
    At the mile mark, McCandless had put herself in a solid position of 16th place in 5:28.  Jenna Melanson '20, Jenny Xu '19 and Bacher were together between 60th and 70th place in 5:36 while Leandra Zimmermann '19 and Mary Eccles '18 were in about 100th position at 5:44.  Maryann Gong '17, racing for the first time after her recovery from a stress fracture this past Summer, was in 120th in 5:48.
    
    
                      
    
    By the two mile mark all had moved up nicely. McCandless was in a solid fourth place, by herself, about 60 meters or so behind the top three.  Melanson had moved up to 30th place with Xu close behind in 35th.  Zimmermann and Bacher were back at 45th and 46th. Eccles was in 88th with Gong in 92nd. 
    
    
                      
    
    Working alone must have hurt McCandless a bit as she was unable to move up, losing ground to the leaders and dropping back to fifth for a short period during the third mile. A solid finish brought her across the line in fourth place in 17:57, the best time ever by an MIT runner on a course slightly longer than 5K.  Melanson maintained her place of 30th and Xu moved up with her, finishing in 31st, both earning times of 18:33. Zimmermann closed a lot, finishing in 40th in 18:39.  Gong closed out the scoring with an 18:51 in 54th place.  Eccles finished sixth for Tech in 71st overall at 19:00 while Bacher paid for her fast start with a finish in 80th place in 19:10.  The women performed well, showing why they are ranked second in NCAA Division III.
    
    
                      
    
    In the women's sub-varsity race, MIT also placed fifth with 133 points.  Christina Wicker '17, racing for the first time after a long recovery from a hamstring injury, led the way in 19:14.  Clemmie Mitchell '18 was close behind in 19:17.  Tessa Weiss '20 (19:28), Bailee Margolis '19 (19:30) and Darby LaPlant '19 (19:44) were the other scorers.
    
    
                      
    
    The men, led by Deyo were very aggressive and were somewhat aided by an unusually well paced effort by the leaders.  In what is usually a sub 4:35 first mile, was a comparatively slow 4:44.  Deyo, Derrick and Maloney worked exceptionally well together, coming through the first mile in 4:47 around 25th place.  The rest of the top seven, Weiss, Goldy, Alex Knoedler '18 and Alex Knapp '19 were clustered around 120th in 4:56.
    
    
                      
    
    With both groups working so well together they easily moved up in the field.  By two miles, Derrick was up to seventh place and Deyo and Maloney were right behind in 10th and 11th.  Weiss and Goldy were around 45th place after a strong second mile.  Knoedler and Knapp fell off the pace by 10 seconds or so.
    
    
                      
    
    During the third and fourth mile, particularly at the end of the fourth mile, Deyo pulled away slightly from his teammates but lost ground overall to the leaders as he fell back to 12th place.  Derrick and Maloney stayed together, but had also fallen back to 16th and 17th place.  Weiss and Goldy were also working really well together through three miles when they had both moved up into the top 40, but separated through the wilderness loop as they fell back into the mid-40's.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final mile, Deyo moved back to 10th place to finish in 25:08.  Derrick and Maloney stayed together but lost more ground, dropping back to 21st and 22nd respectively, both in 25:21.  However, Weiss caught back up to 39th and Goldy finished very well to nab 40th place, their times both 25:38.  The :30 delta was quite impressive, showing the NCAA Division III ranking of 5th in the country is very deserving.
    
    
                      
    
    Although Knoedler and Knapp did not have their best days, 26:22 and 26:50 respectively, a few of their teammates had a very solid showing in the sub-varsity race.  The men nearly pulled off the sub-varsity team victory, losing a five point decision to Amherst, 87 to 92.  Leading the way was Josh Rosenkranz '19 finishing in eighth in 26:10. Nicholas Waltman '18, running a very ambitious race, held on for 11th in 26:13.  Brian Gilligan '17 ran a very even paced race to finish 22nd in 26:25.  Aidan Gilson '19 ran his best collegiate cross country race, placing 31st in 26:37.  Closing out the scoring was a come from behind effort by Cooper Sloan '18, placing 41st in 26:44.
    
    
                      
    
    Overall, it was a great day for the Engineers.  Next weekend, MIT travels to Rowan University in Glassboro, NJ for the "Border Battle", a meet with a large number of nationally ranked Division III teams.

    MIT Men and Women Continue Stronghold on NEWMAC Cross Country Championship 
    
    
                      
    
    October 29, 2016
    
    
                      
    
    MIT dominated the NEWMAC Cross Country Championship, hosted by Smith College, the NCAA fifth ranked men winning their 19th consecutive title and the NCAA second ranked women taking their 10th straight championship.  Due to a significant storm on Thursday, the meet had to be delayed three hours so the Smith College grounds crew could clear the fallen trees and branches from the course.  They did a marvelous job, leaving the course in excellent condition.  
    
    
                      
    
    With temperatures in the mid-50's, the men raced first in the 8K race.  The course had four significant hills so the Engineers played it safe through the first two miles of the race, running mile splits of 5:25 and 10:44.  This took the team through two of the big hills and at that point they took the lead and picked up the pace significantly.  There were three WPI runners, one Babson College runner and seven MIT harriers in that lead group. 
    
    
                      
    
    After a third mile of 4:49, Matt Deyo 'G, Dennis Maloney '19, and Josh Derrick '20 had a three second lead over Matthew Dynan '19 of Babson, Austin Scott '17 of WPI, Alex Knoedler '18 of MIT and Rory Beyer '17 of MIT. Ben Freed '18 and Daniel Weiss '19 were another four seconds back, giving chase.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final two miles, Deyo, Maloney and Derrick fought it out as they hit the final two hills.  Deyo finally opened up a lead in the final downhill as he came out of the woods going full speed.  His final mile of 4:47 was too much for Maloney who finished three seconds back, 25:26 to 25:29.  Deyo earned Runner of the Year honors for his victory.  Derrick finished in third in 25:32, taking home the Rookie of the Year honors.  Dynan and Scott broke up the MIT sweep, earning fourth and fifth places respectively.  Beyer had gapped Knoedler along with Dynan and Scott on the fourth mile, but cramped and backed off, losing the lead.  Knoedler took sixth in 26:05 with Beyer earning seventh in 26:07 to give MIT 19 points.  Freed closed well to finish in eighth in 26:11 with Weiss taking ninth in 26:15.  Aidan Gilson '19 and Nicholas Waltman '18 claimed 12th and 13th respectively in 26:19 and 26:21 to earn All Conference awards.
    
    
                      
    
    The women's 5K course  had three major hills, so a similar strategy was employed, letting others set the pace through the second of the three hills, which was about at the halfway point in the race.  At the mile mark (6:09) there was a pack of 12 runners, Edie Sharon '17 of Wellesley, Casey Hecox '19 of Smith, eight MIT runners (Megan McCandless '20, Mary Eccles '18, Maryann Gong '17, Christina Wicker '17, Leandra Zimmermann '19, Jenny Xu '19, Katie Bacher '20 and Jenna Melanson '20) along with two runners from WPI.
    
    
                      
    
    After the second hill, McCandless took things into her own hands, dropping the pace so that she opened up a four second lead by the two mile mark at 12:08. Eccles and Gong were right behind in 12:12 with Wicker at 12:16 and Zimmermann at 12:21.  Melanson, Bacher and Xu had fallen off the pace, trailing Sharon of Wellesley.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final 1.1 miles not much changed other than McCandless throwing down a 5:32 to open up a 24 second victory in 18:17 over Eccles (18:41) who had an amazing race, attacking the uphills and downhills.  Gong was third in 18:42.  Wicker stayed close, finishing fourth in 18:46 and Zimmermann finished the sweep with her 18:54.  Xu finished strong while Bacher and Melanson faded in the final mile, giving Xu seventh place behind Sharon in 19:04.  Bacher was two places back in 19:14 and Melanson two more places back in 11th in 19:17.  Rounding out the All Conference team were MIT runners Marissa McPhillips '20 finishing 12th in 19:19, Clemmie Mitchell '18 in 13th at 19:30, Darby LaPlant in 14th at 19:34 and Tessa Weiss '20 in 16th at 19:39.  McCandless took home both Runner of the Year and Rookie of the Year awards.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT takes a week off from racing as they prepare for the NCAA Division III New England Region Championship / NCAA Division III Qualifier on November 12 at Westfield State College.

    Women 2nd, Men 3rd at Purple Valley
    
    
                      
    
    #### Freshmen McCandless and Derrick Shine
    
    
                      
    
      
    
    
                      
    
    September 24, 2016
    
    
                      
    
    Despite an auspicious start, the men's and women's cross country teams from MIT performed very well in their first race of the year, the women placing just six points out of first among seven of the top 11 teams in the country, and the men placing third among nine nationally ranked teams and 23 teams in all for both genders at the Purple Valley Classic.  En route to the meet, the bus MIT was taking was overheating.  Fortunately, the bus company's headquarters was close by.  Between the multiple stops for the bus to cool down and the delay to deviate from the route and transfer buses, the cost was about 30 minutes.  The men were forced to alter their normal warm-up routine but did not seem to let it affect them.
    
    
                      
    
    For late September, the mid-60 degree temperature and partly cloudy skies were as good as one could expect.  The ground was a little soft, but overall the course was in great shape.  With MIT's women only having a practice meet against their alumni under their belt, this was trial by fire.  They were about to see if they deserved their number five ranking nationally, even though they were not running All America runners Maryann Gong '17 and Christina Wicker '17.  The nationally ranked competition included host Williams (1), SUNY Geneseo (2), Tufts (6), Middlebury (8), UW Lacrosse (10), RPI (11), Ithaca (14), Amherst (21), and Dickinson (30) among the 23 colleges racing in the women's 6K race.
    
    
                      
    
    From the start, the pace was reasonable for the conditions--quick, but not too much so.  At the mile mark a group of seven or so, including MIT's Megan McCandless '20 as well as three from SUNY Geneseo, one from Middlebury and one from Williams were slightly in front, at 5:55, of a chase pack loaded with Williams, SUNY Geneseo and MIT runners, among others. During the latter part of the second mile MIT's chase group moved up in the pack as the lead group pulled away a bit.  At the two mile mark, McCandless was pretty comfortable at 11:48 while MIT's chase group of Leandra Zimmermann '19, Jenna Melanson '20, Mary Eccles '18 and Katie Bacher '20 were all at 11:56, although it appeared Bacher was struggling to stay up.  
    
    
                      
    
    The third mile was where the race would be decided as it went into the woods and then up a major hill, followed by a steep downhill.  About halfway up the hill McCandless pulled away, splitting the third mile in 5:57 despite the hill.  Her teammates fell off with 6:20 to 6:40 third miles, but continued to race and be competitive.  McCandless held her lead, winning in 21:58 on the very challenging course.  Zimmermann finished in 11th in 22:35, Melanson 14th in 22:39, Eccles 18th in 22:47 and Bacher 27th in 23:04.  Geneseo placed their runners 6, 7, 16, 17, 19 to just beat Tech by six points.  Williams, who seemed to be without a couple of runners, was third with 100 points.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's men's team was also quite young, but  quite deep as well. This was also their first race, outside of their Alumni Meet, and a big jump in distance for all the freshmen, going from 5K in high school to 8K in college.  MIT, ranked number six in NCAA Division III, were up against SUNY Geneseo (2), Williams (3), Amherst (10), Colby (16), RPI (19), NYU (25), Tufts (28) and Dickinson (30).
    
    
                      
    
    Unlike the women's race, the men went out pretty fast at the start. After the half mile they settled into a more conservative pace, given the men have to ascend the big hill twice.  MIT was packed pretty well among the lead group, but they did not seem relaxed, almost as if they were a bit too anxious.  Josh Derrick '20, Matt Deyo 'G, Colin Godwin '17 and Dennis Maloney '19 came through the mile in 5:07 and Steven Goldy '20 was close behind at 5:12.  
    
    
                      
    
    The second mile included the first time the men ran the big hill.  MIT's top seven ran the mile in 5:17-5:22 to stay in contention.  In the third mile, which was flat, Tech runners collected themselves and ran well.  Derrick and Maloney came through in 15:30 and Godwin and Deyo were right behind.  Goldy was eight seconds back, but looking good. Daniel Weiss '19 and Alex Knapp '19 were closing ground, hitting the three mile at 15:46 and 15:47 respectively.
    
    
                      
    
    The fourth mile hit the hill for the second time and ended anyone who had pushed the pace early in the race.  Derrick was a monster on this mile, separating himself from his teammates with a 5:13 mile.  Deyo, Godwin, Maloney, Goldy and Weiss were all in the 5:20's as they lost contact with the leaders.  Derrick continued his fast pace to the finish, running a 5:00 last mile for an eighth place 25:43, the fourth fastest time ever run by an MIT runner on this course.  Deyo ended up in 15th place in 25:58, Godwin 17th in 26:00, Maloney 22nd in 26:06 and Goldy 26th in 26:14.  Weiss and Knapp held on well to finish in 32nd and 36th respectively in 26:25 and 26:27.  Geneseo finished with an impressive 48 points with Williams in second with 64 points.  MIT was solid, but back at 89 points to beat out Amherst with 107 points.
    
    
                      
    
    The women will have to work on closing their gap between McCandless and the rest of the team, so perhaps Gong and Wicker can take care of that.  The men will have to get more front runners at the finish line if they hope to be among the top teams at nationals.  Both teams have next weekend off and will next compete at the NEICAAA All Division New England Championship on October 8 at Franklin Park.
