TRI-MEET</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>1-2 Finish By Feldman and Keehr Lead Way To
Victory</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>September 16, 2000</P>

<P>MIT's Mens Cross Country team traveled to the Tufts' course at
their veterinary school in Grafton, Massachusetts ranked 7th in NCAA
Division III. The MIT harriers did nothing to hurt that ranking as
they defeated 12th ranked Tufts and 24th ranked Bates by a score of
26 to 35 to 73.</P>

<P>Dan Feldman '02, led from the 1 mile mark to the finish with a
comfortable 12 second margin of victory over teammate Ed Keehr '01.
Ed had a challenging battle with JR Cruz and did not pull away until
the final mile. Sean Nolan '03, ran a great race while suffering with
a cold in its early stages. Sean seemed to lose focus during the very
difficult 3rd mile, but got back in the race during mile 4 as he
sensed he could catch David Patterson from Tufts. Sean did this and
held onto 4th place despite falling back in the last mile.</P>

<P>After Sean, MIT sorely missed Mark Strauss '02, out with a quad
strain for the second race in a row. Picking up the slack, but not
until Tufts had their 4th runner in, were Albert Liu '03, Liyan Guo
'01, and Sean Montgomery '01, who finished 9th, 10th, and 11th
respectively to seal the victory over Tufts. Albert ran a very good
race, deviating his pace very little throughout the race. Liyan did
not handle the hills very well, and it showed as he faded behind
Albert in the 3rd mile. Nevertheless, Liyan rallied in the final two
miles to prevent anyone from Tufts catching him. Sean is slowly
rounding back into the racing shape and attitude that had him as
Tech's #2 runner last year. Sean ran a strong race for the first four
miles, but failed to rally with his usually strong final mile that
his opponents have grown to fear.</P>

<P>A supporting cast consisting of Brian Anderson '04, George Hanson
'03, Craig Wildman '03, and Matt Yarosz '00, finished well in 17th,
20th, 22nd, and 23rd places respectively, but did not figure in the
scoring. The group broke up early and did little to help each other
during the race. Their individual competitiveness and hard training
allowed them to have a good race on a course slowed significantly by
the heavy rains the day before that made the ground soft and grass a
little tall.</P>

<P>The MIT team is rounding into a very good team. Right now their
consistent spread of 20+ seconds separating the top 3 runners is
great. When Strauss joins that group they will be one short of a
great team. If Montgomery can get back to form, or Phil Loiselle '01,
who is just coming back from a summer injury, can return to his
racing form of last year, or someone else can step up, MIT's XC team
will be one to reckon with at the Championships in November.</P>

<P>This coming weekend, MIT travels to their home course at Franklin
Park to defend the Codfish Bowl.</P>
