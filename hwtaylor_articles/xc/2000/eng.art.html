<P>September 9, 2000</P>

<P>Running on a new course, in hot and humid conditions, MIT's Mens
Cross Country team defended the Engineer's Cup against RPI and WPI
for the fifth year in succession. Not only did the Tech harriers win,
they swept for the second week in a row, outscoring their opponents
15 to 49 for RPI to 56 for WPI.</P>

<P>MIT's plan was to run an aggressive pace on this predominantly
flat, but untried course, even given the heat and humid conditions
the runners were no longer accustomed to. Dan Feldman '02, went out
in the lead at the start, coming through the first mile in 4:57. Dan
continued to run a relatively even pace the entire race as he led
from start to finish in a winning time of 25:16.</P>

<P>MIT's second group, consisting of Sean Nolan '03, Ed Keehr '01,
and Liyan Guo '01 had to run without Mark Strauss '02, due to a
strained quadriceps muscle. Nevertheless, the group ran a great race,
going out in a conservative 5:12, trailing ambitious Justin Lutz from
WPI who had gone out with Feldman. By mile 2 Nolan and Keehr had
walked Lutz down and continued to negative split the course, running
25:41 and 25:45 respectively. Liyan Guo had a more difficult time
with the heat and the course, but nevertheless placed 4th in
26:20.</P>

<P>Tech's 3rd group went out a little too fast and except for Albert
Liu '03, paid dearly as they broke up early on in the race, pulling
their collective parachutes. Albert went out a little quickly but his
summer of high mileage gave him the strength to minimize his loss,
allowing him to keep his miles within 15 seconds of each other, and
place 5th to give MIT the sweep. Sean Montgomery '01, and freshman
Brian Anderson did not fair so well. </P>

<P>The 4th group broke up after the first mile as Craig Wildman '03,
ran an aggressive 2nd mile, and an even more aggressive 3rd mile. The
hot conditions made Craig pay the price as he faded badly in the last
mile, but held on for 7th on the team and 12th overall. George Hanson
'03, ran an outstanding race, slowing a bit on the 3rd mile, but
generally passing people the entire race to finish 6th on the team
and 11th overall.</P>

<P>Next week, the Engineers travel to Tufts' course in Grafton to
race Tufts and Bates who last year placed 9th and 10th at nationals
respectively.</P>
