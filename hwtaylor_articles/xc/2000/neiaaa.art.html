ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIP</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Franklin Park - October 13, 2000</P>

<P>It was an unseasonably hot day, and the forces were a bit
depleted, but expectations of setting a positive trend for the
remainder of the championship season were high. In a race filled with
mixed results for the MIT troops, Tech finished 18th out of 42 New
England Colleges representing all Divisions sponsored by the NCAA,
and 5th out of the Division III Institutions.</P>

<P>Dan Feldman led the way as usual with a solid 17th place
performance. Uncharacteristically, Dan ran a conservative first two
miles, but probably stressed too much about where he wanted to
eventually finish, thus using up all his energy before the finish
despite the paced effort. Dan moved from 45th at the mile to 29 at
the 2 mile to 19th at the 3 mile. It was a great plan, but there
wasn't much left in the tank to finish the job.</P>

<P>Sean Nolan also ran a conservative race, and for the first time
this season, was by himself as Ed Keehr was out resting a tight
hamstring. Sean ran a strong race, also moving up throughout the
length of the race. When Keehr comes back, they should make a very
formidable pair.</P>

<P>Albert Liu was the third Tech runner through the finish, and did
so in 109th place. Albert's time of 26:30 was his best ever. Albert's
confidence is growing incrementally, and should be right where he and
his team wants it in four weeks.</P>

<P>Liyan Guo made his first race back from a thigh injury a
successful one as he ran 26:45 to finish in 128th place. While the
time is nearly a minute slower than his best time ever, it is better
than he was running prior to taking some time off. Liyan has been
there before and knows how to get the job done.</P>

<P>In Ed Keehr's absence, Craig Wildman, Sean Montgomery, and Brian
Anderson were out to step up and get the job done. Although Craig ran
a personal best by 1 second, it was not enough as the delta for
runners 1-5 fell to 2:04. Sean "has fallen and cannot get up" as he
tries to find his way back to the form that had him finish 65th at
last year's nationals. Brian is just learning how to race cross
country with the same success that he is accustomed to in track. His
best time this year at Franklin Park is 27:20, showing promise for
the future.</P>

<P>Next week, the team will travel back to Franklin Park for the
Mayor's Cup, which will be held on Sunday.</P>
