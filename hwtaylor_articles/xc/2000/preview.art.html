<P>September 28, 2000</P>

<P>Assuming, perhaps prematurely, they will qualify for the NCAA
Cross Country Championships in November, MIT made their annual trek
to the National Preview Invitational. In a small field of nine teams,
including defending national champion North Central College, MIT
placed 4th with 101 points behind North Central (55), Nebraska
Wesleyan (65), and Lewis and Clark University (71).</P>

<P>Ranked as high as 7th in NCAA Division III this season, MIT has
begun to slip as injuries to Mark Strauss and Liyan Guo, coupled with
no one on the team stepping up to help the consistent running of Dan
Feldman, Ed Keehr, and Sean Nolan, has proven the team is not a top
10 team and may have some work to do if they want to make nationals.
In this meet, Nolan, finishing 11th for MIT behind Feldman in 5th,
and Keehr in 10th, placed higher than any other teams 3rd man. Tech
then had to wait over a minute for their next finisher, Albert Liu,
as 26 runners crossed the line. Albert and Sean Montgomery ran
together for most of the race and finished together in 26:49, placing
37 and 38 respectively.</P>

<P>On a basically flat course, the leaders went out in a crisp but
conservative 4:54 for the first mile. Feldman was among the leaders
right at the start as a group of six runners broke away from the rest
of the field. Keehr and Nolan were in about 15th position at the mile
mark. Liu and Montgomery, running conservatively with a 5:10 1st
mile, moved up to around 35th position by the 2 mile mark. Places did
not change much for the remainder of the race, although collectively,
Tech did lose 13 points in the final 3 miles. </P>

<P>Coach Halston Taylor feels his harriers continue to go out a
little too fast at the start. However, he also says, "We can compete
with anyone in Division III through our first 3 runners. I have faith
the team will step up when the time comes."</P>

<P>For the second week in succession, Ray Molnar has shown he wants
to be in the top 7 at the end of the season as he finished 6th for
the Engineers in 46th place. Three places back, Craig Wildman also
ran well to finish as MIT's 7th man.</P>

<P>If MIT can get their missing runners healthy, and close the gap
between their current 3 and 4 runners, they will indeed be a team to
reckon with. As it is, they are a good team that is missing a piece
of the puzzle.</P>

<P>Next week, those not racing in Spokane this weekend, will make the
trip to Rhode Island for the Bryant College Invitational. The varsity
will rest up for the All New England Championship on October 13.</P>
