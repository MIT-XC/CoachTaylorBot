                        Place, Women Finish Fourth in Purple Valley Invitational  </span></strong></p>
                  <p align="center">September 25, 2010</p>
                  <p align="left">For the fourth Saturday in succession,
                    the weather was sunny with temperatures in the 70's, not
                    ideal for cross country, but good enough for the hilly course
                    in the <a href="pv.res.php">Purple Valley Classic</a> hosted
                    by Williams College.&nbsp; The runners took advantage of
                    the national class fields and ran superb performances.&nbsp; MIT's
                    men, ranked 29th in NCAA Division III, should move up significantly
                    as they tied #18 Keene State with 90 points while defeating
                    #23 Amherst College and #13 Williams College, among the 18
                    schools competing. The lady harriers from Tech were not as
                    fortunate.&nbsp; Racing
                    without three of their top eight runners, missing for precautionary
                    measures, the Engineers were not able to pack in well enough
                    to defeat #2 ranked Middlebury College, who won the meet
                    with 57 points, #8 Williams College, second with 76 points
                    and #9 John's Hopkins, third with 86 points.&nbsp; MIT finished
                    fourth among the 19 teams with 102 points.</p>
                  <p align="left">In the men's 8K race, MIT got off the line
                    well and settled in to the early pace.&nbsp; Paul Welle '11,
                    worked his way to the front of the pack in the  second mile
                    after coming through the first mile in 5:12 and hitting the
                    second mile in 10:37.&nbsp; Stephen
                    Serene '12, Dan Harper '12 and Richard Prevost '11 had formed
                    a nice group by the end of the second mile, 11 second behind
                    Welle.&nbsp; Roy Wedge '14, began the race more conservatively
                    with splits of 5:23 and 10:57.&nbsp; In the third mile Welle
                    stayed with the leaders, running a 5:09 on the flat part
                    of the course.&nbsp; Serene and Prevost continued to work
                    together, putting in 5:15 miles while Harper fell two seconds
                    back.&nbsp; Wedge began to close the gap, putting in a 5:09
                    mile himself to move within a second of Harper.&nbsp; In
                    the fourth mile, Welle could no longer stay with the leaders
                    on the large hill, falling back to sixth place.&nbsp; Serene
                    and Wedge moved up well, passing those who could not handle
                    the hill.&nbsp; Prevost had a poor mile, falling 38 seconds
                    behind Welle.&nbsp; Harper maintained his position and was
                    only 33 seconds behind Welle.&nbsp; In the final mile, Welle
                    was very fatigued, but only lost three more places to finish
                    in ninth place since the race had become so strung out.&nbsp; Serene
                    and Wedge closed hard with 5:16 miles to place 14th and 16th
                    respectively.&nbsp; Prevost rallied with a 5:17 to move back
                    to 24th place and Harper closed pretty well in 5:24 to finish
                    in 27th position.&nbsp; The 29 second delta was superb and
                    good enough to earn the share of victory for MIT despite
                    not having a front runner at the finish.</p>
                  <p align="left">The women thought they would be racing everyone
                    in their top eight, but two days before the race, Anna Holt-Gosselin
                    '11, and Olivia Papa '14, came up with quad strains that
                    warranted a cautious approach, thus the decision to not race
                    the challenging 6K.&nbsp; Emma
                    Broderick '14, running 18:32 in her first cross country race
                    ever, also had to miss the race, leaving MIT a bit thin up
                    front.&nbsp; Similarly to the men, the women got out well
                    at the start and appeared in perfect position to take control
                    of the race in the second mile. However, only Tania Morimoto
                    '12, was out with the leaders, which included four runners
                    from John's Hopkins and two from Williams.&nbsp; Alina
                    Gatowski '11, and Katherine Eve '12, were in a great position
                    to move up but with Eve suffering from a cold and Gatowski
                    feeling fatigued, neither could respond as Middlebury came
                    racing by.&nbsp;Morimoto was 5:56 in the first mile and ran
                    an excellent second mile in 5:57.&nbsp; Morimoto was 11 seconds
                    ahead of Gatowski at the two mile mark with Eve another three
                    seconds back.&nbsp; Freshmen Martina de Geus, Claire O'Connell
                    and Sherry Fu came through in 12:17, 12:20 and 12:30 respectively.&nbsp; The
                    hilly third mile took its toll on the MIT runners as the
                    top runners from Middlebury, Williams and John's Hopkins
                    put themselves ahead of all MIT runners.&nbsp; Middlebury
                    put three runners ahead of MIT's top three and then three
                    more ahead of de Geus, who finished in an excellent 25th
                    place.&nbsp; Williams
                    had two in front of Morimoto, MIT's top finisher in 11th
                    place and then two more ahead of de Geus and three more ahead
                    of O'Connell. John's Hopkins faded from the start but were
                    still ahead of MIT by virtue of putting three runners ahead
                    of Morimoto.&nbsp; Gatowski closed well in the final .75
                    mile to finish in 13th and Eve was just behind in 15th.&nbsp; O'Connell
                    fade a bit more, but ran tough to finish in 41st place.&nbsp;Fu
                    finished close behind in 54th place out of the 210 finishers.</p>
                  <p align="left">While the men presented themselves as one of
                    the top teams in New England Division III and the women failed
                    again to get everyone to the starting line, there are still
                    seven weeks to go before the regional championships, plenty
                    of time for MIT to get even stronger and put everything together.&nbsp; In
                    two weeks, MIT will be back at Franklin Park for the All
                    New England Championship, a race pitting all the colleges
                    in New England against each other from Division I, II and
                    III.&nbsp; Last year, the women finished fourth while the
                    men earned 29th place.</p>
