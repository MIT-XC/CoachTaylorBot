    **Freshmen Spoil Alumni
                            Turnout - Wentz and Serene Win**
    
    
                      
    
    September 4, 2010
    
    
                      
    
    Despite the best turnout of alumni in the history
                        of the meet, the varsity, led by the core performance of
                        a trio of freshmen for both the men and women, outlasted
                        the alumni by a score of 24 to 31 in the women's 5K event,
                        and 20-31 in the men's 8K race.
    
    
                      
    
    On a windy, but warm day of 80 degrees, 10
                        alums lined up against six varsity harriers in the women's
                        race at Franklin Park.  The
                        pre-race favorite was Jacqui Wentz '10, All America winner
                        in cross country and national champion in the 3000 meter
                        steeplechase.  The alumni were well represented with
                        a supporting cast of Adrienne Bolger '09, Andrea Bradshaw
                        '09, Martha Buckley '04, Karen Condon '07, Betsy Eames '06,
                        Elizabeth Finn '08, Liz Labuz '09, Rachel Niehuus '07 and
                        Alisha Schor '07.  However, as we all discover, it is
                        more difficult to train consistently for races like this
                        when one is no longer with the team.  The spirit and
                        ability were there, but the training not quite.
    
    
                      
    
    As predicted, Wentz led at the start.  Tania
                        Morimoto '12, started off conservatively, but moved up and
                        pulled even with Wentz by the mile mark, coming through with
                        a split of 6:08.  The alumni were spread out a bit,
                        but Bradshaw was running just ahead of the three freshmen,
                        Olivia Papa, Claire O'Connell and Martina de Geus, all of
                        whom came through in 6:13.  The second mile was where
                        Morimoto tried to make her move, but Wentz was just too good
                        on this day and she pulled away, with a very impressive 6:10
                        second mile on the uphill portion of the course.  Morimoto
                        managed a very strong 6:15 and continued to look strong.   The
                        freshmen had caught Bradshaw and began to push the pace as
                        they came through the second mile in 6:32.
    
    
                      
    
    Wentz continued to pull away, winning with
                        a strong 19:09.  Morimoto faded a bit in the final mile
                        with a 6:28, but managed an excellent second place with an
                        overall time of 19:37. O'Connell made a strong move
                        in the Wilderness but took a wrong turn, negating her break
                        and putting in a catch-up position.  Papa took advantage
                        and made a move of her own, running a 6:14 third mile to
                        claim third in 19:44.  O'Connell recovered and appeared
                        to have fourth place locked up, but Bradshaw's kick was too
                        much. Bradshaw earned fourth in 19:50 while O'Connell
                        ran 19:52.  de Geus finished well, placing sixth in
                        19:54.  Finn was the third Alumni finisher, placing
                        seventh in 20:32.  Juliann Lajoie '13, was the fifth
                        finisher for the Varsity, placing eighth in 21:05.  Bolger
                        and Niehuus were the final scorers for the Alumni with respective
                        times of 21:11 and 21:27. 
    
    
                      
    
    In the men's race, Dan Harper '12, with Stephen
                        Serene '12, trailing, took the pace out, coming through the
                        first mile in 5:13.  Serene was close behind in 5:15
                        with Carlos Renjifo '04, following and looking intent on
                        reeling them in.  The three freshmen, Roy Wedge, Eric
                        Safai and Jay McKenna were together at 5:33 along with Bill
                        Phipps '10.  New dad, Ben Schmeckpeper '05, and Trevor
                        Rundell '09 followed closely.
    
    
                      
    
    In the second mile, Renjifo took a solid lead
                        going into the third mile with Harper still ahead of Serene.  Wedge
                        was starting to edge away from the group, although Phipps
                        was hanging tough.  Schmeckpeper, Chris Wong '08, and
                        Eric Khatchadourian '06, were not the chase group for the
                        Alumni.  During the third mile, Renjifo had built a
                        four second lead over Harper, who was three seconds ahead
                        of Serene.  Wedge and Safai had pulled away from Phipps,
                        who had in turn pulled away from McKenna.  Khatchadourian
                        was pulling away from Schmeckpeper and Wong, but Joe Christopher
                        '12, a Cambridge University student on a year abroad to MIT,
                        was closing in on Khatchadourian.
    
    
                      
    
    Serene made the move of the race, throwing
                        down a 5:25 fourth mile to catch and pull away from both
                        Renjifo and Harper by a sizeable margin.  Wedge and
                        Safai were still close together, but Khatchadourian had passed
                        Phipps and was right with McKenna, who was just ahead of
                        Christopher.  Chris Wong, Terry McNatt '87, and Bob
                        Collins '82, were now the chase group, taking advantage of
                        a conservative start. 
    
    
                      
    
    The order of things really did not change much
                        in the final mile.  Serene won in 26:39 to Renjifo's
                        26:53 and Harper's 27:14.  Wedge had the fastest final
                        mile, running 4:57 to close within nine seconds of Harper.  Safai
                        held onto fifth, but Khatchadourian moved into sixth, defeating
                        McKenna by three seconds.  Phipps held onto eighth although
                        Christopher closed to within two seconds for ninth.  Closing
                        out the scoring for the Alumni were Wong and McNatt, running
                        28:24 and 28:30 respectively.  
    
    
                      
    
    Also representing the "Has Beens" were Fivos
                        Constantinou '06, Ian Driver '05, Joe Roy-Mayhew '08, Tyler
                        Abrams '09, Bob Zak '86, Peter Mulligan '08, Ashley Clayborne
                        '99, Neal Karchem '99, Don Shobrys '75, and Jeff Lukas '82. In
                        addition, many alums came to watch and cheer on their teammates.
                         Afterwards, everyone enjoyed the great weather as they
                       shared old stories and pizza, promising to be in better shape
                       in 2011.
    
    
                      
    
    Next Saturday, MIT is back at Franklin Park
                        to compete against RPI and WPI, starting @ 12:00 for the
                        women and 12:30 for the men.  MIT will run most of those
                        who were held out of this weekend's race.

    October 16, 2010
    
    
                      
    
    This Saturday, the MIT Engineers traveled south to the Connecticut College Cross Country Invitational at scenic Harkness Memorial State Park. The nineteen team field showcased teams from many New England states, as well as New Jersey and New York. The course was flat and relatively firm given the amount of rain the day before, the temperature was excellent in the mid 50s, but the winds were extremely powerful, gusting in excess of 30mph. 
    
    
                      
    
    The men were up first and without any of the top six runners racing for MIT, no one from Tech challenged for the lead. MIT's top runners, Andrew Erickson '12, and Logan Trimble '13, came through the first mile at 5:10, along with teammates Jay McKenna '14, and Eric Safai '14, but the prescribed group running ceased to exist after that, as it appeared to be every man for himself. 
    
    
                      
    
    Erickson threw in a strong second mile to move up through the field, at one point being around the top 20, but then faded a bit in the third mile. Trimble ran steady but slowed a bit each mile. Joe Christopher '12, and Matt Weaver '12, caught up to the fading McKenna and Safai at the end of the third mile, moving up to third and fourth respectively for MIT.
    
    
                      
    
    In the last mile Trimble moved past Erickson by a couple of seconds, but Erickson found his kick and beat him to the finish by one second in 26:45 for 37th place. Trimble was two places back and Christopher was 58th in 27:07. Weaver finished in 71st place in 27:16 and McKenna held on to 75th position in 27:20 to give the Engineers 253 points, good for ninth place in the 19 team / 225 person field. 
    
    
                      
    
    The women were represented by one of their varsity runners, Alina Gatowski '11, and those vying for the seventh position on the team. This was the first 6K, the championship distance for women at the NCAAs, for most of the women on the team. The ladies paced themselves quite well, running near even splits and moving up well throughout the race to end up with a fine third place finish out of the 18 team field, scoring 93 points.
    
    
                      
    
    Gatowski was cautious in the beginning but by the mile mark was with the leaders at 5:46. The rest of the MIT pack, were not as together as they were supposed to be. For some reason the group running plan seems to evade this particular group of athletes. Maggie Lloyd '12, was leading this group, coming through the mile in 6:11, but Olivia Papa '14, who had missed a couple weeks of consistent running with a minor leg injury and a cold, seemed to not be into the race at all and was one second back. Sarah Sprague '13 and Sherry Fu '14, were two seconds behind Papa, but not really working together.
    
    
                      
    
    While not running as well together as they should, it was obvious by the end of the second mile that the MIT runners were racing well. The second mile was very competitive for the Engineers with Gatowski sitting in the lead with two others and Lloyd actually speeding up by one second. Sprague and Fu only slowed down by four seconds in the second mile, so were still moving up through the field which was slowing down at a much more significant rate than they were. 
    
    
                      
    
    At the three mile mark, Gatowski had to settle for second position as she could not stay with the leader on this day. She tried to close the gap over the final three quarters of the mile but was unable to do so, finishing in a fine time of 22:26, a 5:58 average per mile. Lloyd's third mile was yet another second faster than the previous mile and she closed well to finish in seventh place with a time of 23:11, easily her best race ever. Sprague and Fu placed 25th and 27th respectively, running 23:46 and 23:48. Papa stopped the bleeding by picking up the pace a little in the final mile to finish in 31st place to round out the scoring for the Engineers. 
    
    
                      
    
    Plugging in MIT's varsity runners into the fields, using the typical deltas from the competing MIT runners, would have resulted in solid victories for the Engineers in both races. 
    
    
                      
    
    MIT has the next weekend off from racing as they prepare to defend their respective conference titles in the NEWMAC Championship, held in Paxton, MA at Moore State Park.

    **Eve Leads Women to Victory,
                            While Prevost's Win is Not Enough to Secure Men's Title**
    
    
                      
    
    September 11, 2010
    
    
                      
    
    While the women definitely went out much too
                        fast at the start of the Engineer's
                        Cup at Franklin Park,
                        they managed to run faster than their opponents, securing
                        the victory with a score of 18 points to 57 for RPI and 63
                        for WPI.  Katherine Eve '12, took individual honors,
                        leading from start to finish in a superb time of 18:39 on
                        the warm and windy day.  Richard Prevost '11, passed
                        teammate Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, in the final two tenths
                        of a mile to claim the victory in 26:39.  MIT's 1-2
                        finish was not enough to secure the victory as RPI packed
                        in six runners between fourth and ninth to outscore MIT 30
                        to 38, while WPI came in at 69 points.  MIT held out
                        three of their top four women as well as much of their second
                        group of runners while the men held out two of their top
                        three and three of their next four.  The purpose was
                        to give everyone an opportunity to race while not over racing
                        anyone for the season.  This strategy obviously did
                        not play out well in the men's race. 
    
    
                      
    
    The MIT women uncharacteristically sprinted
                        across the field at the start, perhaps following Eve's lead
                        too closely, to easily take early command of the race.  The
                        first mile split of 5:44 for Eve was much faster than planned,
                        but she felt fine so she went with it.  The problem
                        was that Katy Gordon '11, came through in 5:48, and Casey
                        O'Brien '14, who was supposed to be with Gordon, was not
                        able to handle such a fast first mile.  Fortunately,
                        Lauren Allen '13, Sarah Sprague '13, Chandler Burfield '13,
                        and Maggie Lloyd '12, were with the leaders from RPI and
                        WPI at 6:07, which was also a bit too fast, and certainly
                        they were running much slower than 6:07 pace at the time
                        they passed through the mile mark.  Eve
                        continued to pull away, running the challenging second mile
                        in 6:12.  Gordon
                        was fortunate to have the classic, "out of sight, out of
                        mind" scenario play out as she slowed to a 6:35 second mile
                        but still maintained a large lead.  O'Brien faded, but
                        Allen, Sprague, Burfield and Lloyd moved up, distancing themselves
                        from their opponents with the exception of Vicky Hewey of
                        WPI, who broke up the MIT sweep with her third place finish.
    
    
                      
    
    The men ran a much smarter  race, coming through
                        the mile mark in the planned 5:11 pace for Amarasiriwardena
                        and Matt Metlitz '14 and 5:14 for Prevost, Jacob Young '13
                        and Matt Weaver '12.  The core group from RPI were running
                        well as a pack and ahead of MIT's second group of runners.  The
                        second mile was too slow for all of the MIT runners, missing
                        the opportunity to close the meet early.  However, by
                        the third mile mark, MIT was in the lead and in position
                        to take over the race.  The problem was that RPI was
                        prepared for an 8K race, while it appeared MIT was only ready
                        for a 5K.  Metlitz faded with a 5:36 fourth mile, while
                        Young was even worse with a 5:41.  The RPI runners maintained
                        their group and took over the race in the fourth mile, 
                        closing it out in the final mile. With the exception
                        of Prevost, Amarasiriwardena and Logan Trimble '13, who ended
                        up as MIT's fifth man in 27:28, everyone else continued to
                        fade in the fifth mile.  The loss was the first for
                        MIT in the Engineer's Cup since 1996. 
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT travels to UMass Dartmouth in
                        North Dartmouth, Massachusetts for a large invitational pitting
                        many of New England's top Division III teams against one
                        another. This
                        will be the first time MIT will run the majority of their

    **Women Third at NCAA Division III Championship, Men 12th in 32 Team Field**
    
    
                      
    
     
    
    
                      
    
    November 20, 2010
    
    
                      
    
    MIT made the most out of their trip to the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship, hosted by Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa. The men, making their first trip since 2001, finished 12th overall in the 32 team field with 347 points, once again the top team in New England. The women, improving each year, finished third with 214 points after earning fifth place in 2009 and 10th in 2008.
    
    
                      
    
    The men's race was first to go in the sub 30 degree temperatures. The strong winds certainly made it seem a lot colder, but this did not affect the Engineers. Tri captains Paul Welle '11, Richard Prevost '11 and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, led the rest of the top seven (Dan Harper '12, Stephen Serene '12, Logan Trimble '13, Roy Wedge '14) to an excellent start, establishing a great position to the first turn.
    
    
                      
    
    By the mile mark, Welle moved into the top 30 with his 4:56 and tried to run with the leaders. Serene and Prevost also established themselves among the 80 runners in the 280 runner field with miles of 4:58. Harper was getting close to joining them and Wedge, who had been knocked down at the first turn was still trying to work his way back into the race. Everyone was looking solid at the two mile mark, although Wedge was still playing catchup. Welle came through in 10:00 while the others were between 10:09 and 10:11. Of course, Wedge was still back at 10:20. By the four mile mark, Serene and Harper had almost caught up to Welle, behind by three and six seconds respectively. Wedge was moving up fast, but Prevost had suffered a slow mile and was continuing to lose ground. In the final mile, the Engineers poured it on, moving past dozens of runners. Harper covering the mile in 4:39, finished first for MIT and 48th overall in 25:08. Right behind him in 25:09 for 51st place was Serene who ran a 4:43 final mile. Welle closed well to finish in 71st place in 25:18, although his 4:55 final mile seemed slow compared to Harper and Serene. Wedge finally made it back to the group, placing 134th in 25:37. Prevost closed out the scoring for MIT, placing 169th in 25:53. Subtracting the non-team finishers, MIT dropped to 347 points.
    
    
                      
    
    The women, never really putting together their best race all season, finished fourth last week in the New England Regional and were tied for seventh in the country according to the rankings. However, just like the past two years, the Lady Engineers came to race and the rankings did not matter. 
    
    
                      
    
    The top seven, comprised of co-captains, Alina Gatowski '11, Tania Morimoto '12, and Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, Katherine Eve '12, Martina de Geus '14, Claire O'Connell '14 and Emma Broderick '14, after one called back start, got off the line very well and established themselves in the top third of the 280 person field. 
    
    
                      
    
    Gatowski put herself among the top 40 at the start and slowly worked her way up. Morimoto, Eve, Holt-Gosselin, de Geus and Broderick were also moving well in the first mile, which they covered in 5:47-5:50. By the two mile mark, Gatowski was in 27th place in 11:37 and looking strong. Morimoto looked fatigued but was still holding her own in 11:46. Eve was moving up very well but still back at 11:51. Holt-Gosselin and de Geus were just behind in 11:54 and 11:56 and looking strong. The 21 second delta through two miles was not great but pretty good.
    
    
                      
    
    During the third mile, Gatowski and Eve both turned in 5:46 miles to hold their position and maybe move up a spot or two. Morimoto held steady with a 5:54 and de Geus caught Holt-Gosselin with a 5:59 effort. The final .72 of the 6K, was run in 4:17 by Gatowski and Eve as they placed 24th and 42nd respectively. Gatowski's place earned her All America status. Morimoto lost a lot of ground, losing 19 seconds to her teammates up front, finishing in 80th place. Holt-Gosselin turned up the speed, finishing in 85th place and de Geus finished 100th overall to close out MIT's scoring, which once the non-team runners were taken out gave MIT the score of 214. Gatowski's 21:40 was a fast 5:49 per mile.
    
    
                      
    
    The third place finish put the ladies on the podium, earning MIT a nice NCAA team trophy and each of the runners an individual trophy.

    **MEN WIN REGIONALS, WOMEN PLACE FOURTH**
    
    
                      
    
    **Both Teams Advance to NCAA Division III Championship**
    
    
                      
    
    November 13, 2010
    
    
                      
    
    MIT competed in the NCAA Division III New England Regional Championship this weekend at the Williams College course at Mt. Greylock High School to try to advance to the NCAA Division III Championship on November 20. 
    
    
                      
    
    With temperatures in the 50's on a bright sunny day and about two dozen MIT alumni and current teammates cheering, the men toed the line first. Forty-nine complete teams were entered and finished in the race with nationally ranked teams among them from Middlebury (11th), Williams (13th), Brandeis (21st), Tufts (24th), Keene State (27th) and Bates (31st). MIT, seeded ninth in the region, and not ranked nationally since a mid-season race when two of the top five were recovering from colds, was not considered one of the favorites.
    
    
                      
    
    It seemed the Engineers decided they wanted a little respect. Getting out well at the gun, Tech established themselves towards the front of the race. At the mile mark, the MIT men were all among the top 30 and looking very strong. The hilly second mile only reinforced the strength of MIT as they stayed towards the front as others dropped off the pace. The third mile, somewhat downhill had Paul Welle '11, with the leaders and Dan Harper '12 and Roy Wedge '14, in the top 12. Stephen Serene '12, and Richard Prevost '11, began to fade a bit but not much. Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, was having an exceptional race, staying in the top 25. Joe Christopher '12, who had begun to struggle in the second mile, lost significant time on this mile. The hilly fourth mile took its toll on many runners, but MIT runners held strong for the most part. Welle ran a very hard mile to stay with the leaders, while Harper and Wedge lost some ground but held onto their places. Serene and Amarasiriwardena lost a little more ground but not enough to take them out of the top 30. The final mile, slightly downhill coming out of the woods and then around a large open field to the finish saw Welle fade from the leaders, but kicking hard at the end to finish in sixth in 25:57. Harper and Wedge worked well together, staying the course and finishing 11th and 12th. Serene rallied to hold onto 29th place and Amarasiriwardena saved the day with a great 35th place. All five earned All New England honors and their total of 93 points beat host Williams, at 101 points, for the championship.
    
    
                      
    
    The women, although co-ranked seventh in the country, did not seem as confident as the men as they prepared for the start. There were 51 complete teams in the race and 336 finished. Other nationally ranked teams were Middlebury (1st), Williams (3rd), Amherst (16th), Colby (26th), Wellesley (28th) and Tufts (35th). While they did get out well, Katherine Eve '12, Claire O'Connell '14, and Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, may have expended a little too much effort. At the mile mark Eve had fallen back quite a bit, but Alina Gatowski '11 and Tania Morimoto '12, were right with the leaders. Holt-Gossselin, injured most of the year, was running well and staying among the top 20. Freshmen, Martina de Geus and O'Connell were five and nine seconds back but looking fresh. Maggie Lloyd '12, was only three seconds back of O'Connell and certainly among the top 40 runners. During the hilly second mile, Morimoto opened up a gap on Gatowski as she stayed with the leaders in 11:40. Eve moved back up to third on the team in 12:03 with Holt-Gosselin and de Geus right behind. The third mile, by far the hilliest on the 6K course, was also the slowest for all MIT runners. Morimoto was no longer with the leaders but she was holding on to her place. Gatowski fell 11 seconds back of Morimoto but was also holding onto her place as the field spread out. Eve and de Geus held their own but Holt-Gosselin, O'Connell and Lloyd all lost more ground and some places. The final .72  went pretty well for MIT. Morimoto and Gatowski fought hard and stayed in the top 10, finishing 8th and 9th respectively in 22:41 and 22:42. Eve finished with an excellent kick to move up to 21st in 23:02 and de Geus was only 16 seconds behind in 31st place. Holt-Gosselin missed All New England by one place, finishing 36th. MIT totaled 105 points to finish fourth, two points behind Amherst College. Williams finished in second place with 91 points and Middlebury showed why they are ranked first in the country, scoring 58 points.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week the Engineers travel to Waverly, Iowa, where Wartburg College will host the NCAA Division III Championships.

    Despite Individual Success, Teams Run
    
    
                      
    
     Average at NEICAAA Championship 
    
    
                      
    
    October 9, 2010
    
    
                      
    
    The weather was near perfect, as was the competition at the NEICAAA Championship on Saturday, a race among all NCAA Divisions in New England. MIT failed to make the most of the opportunity, in part due to a barrage of illness and also due to a lack of competitiveness necessary at this level of competition. Although the ground was soft from the deluge of rain earlier in the week, the times were quite fast. 
    
    
                      
    
    In the women's race, last minute withdrawals of Anna Holt-Gosselin '11, (upper leg injury), Emma Broderick '14, (slight plantar fasciitis) and Olivia Papa '14, (possible reaction to flu shot), combined with a bad cold and sinus infection to Claire O'Connell '14, left the varsity decimated. To the credit of those who raced, they did not let their small numbers affect their performance, earning 12th place overall out of the 47 teams, and third among Division III teams.
    
    
                      
    
    At the start of the race, the quintet racing [Katherine Eve '12, Alina Gatowski '11, Tania Morimoto '12, Martina de Geus '14, and O'Connell (feeling she felt well enough to run)] got squeezed by the teams on either side of them, relegating them to the back of the 350+ person field. However, the team had positioned themselves pretty well by the mile mark. All but Eve came through the flat first mile between 5:40-5:49, well behind the leaders who came through around 5:25.
    
    
                      
    
    By mile two, Morimoto was the lead Engineer at 11:50 with Gatowski right behind her in 11:52. Eve had moved up to third on the team with a solid 6:14 challenging second mile. O'Connell and de Geus had fallen back to 12:17 and 12:13 respectively but had not given up. 
    
    
                      
    
    In the final mile, Eve continued to move up, eventually passing Gatowski in the final 200 meters to place first for MIT and 41st overall in 18:43. Gatowski finished in 44th in 18:45 with Morimoto fading in the final mile to 68th place in 18:56. de Geus held on to 95th place in 19:12 while O'Connell placed 112th in 19:17--quite amazing after suffering all week from her cold. 
    
    
                      
    
    The overall caution of the group in the second mile as well as the failure to engage the top competitors is what is keeping this very talented group from reaching their potential.
    
    
                      
    
    For the men, the expectations were very high as they thought they had a strong possibility of placing in the top 10 and first among Division III teams. Paul Welle '11, the top runner on the team had a cold most of the week, but appeared ready to go. Roy Wedge '14, Stephen Serene '12, and Dan Harper '12, were ready to take care of business. Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, was still feeling the after effects from an earlier infection in his lungs while Richard Prevost '11, also suffering from a cold believed he was ready to go, as was Logan Trimble '13, recently moved up to the varsity top seven.
    
    
                      
    
    The men learned from the women's mistake at the start and got out very well. Coming to the end of the first mile, the team looked great, positioned between 60-120th positions with times between 4:53 and 5:04. Welle, leading the way for MIT, blasted a great second mile, moving into 45th position and looking strong. The rest of the varsity fell behind by another 8-10 seconds instead of pushing the second mile as prescribed. Wedge did push it relative to his 5:04 opening mile, but still fell further behind Welle. 
    
    
                      
    
    The third mile was a painful one for the Engineers. Welle fell back 10 places and was obviously not feeling well. The third mile should be faster than the second mile due to the lack of any real hills, but MIT just held even, losing ground to the competition. The fourth mile was very strong for Wedge, Serene and Harper, but Welle, Amarasiriwardena, Prevost and Trimble continued to slow.
    
    
                      
    
    The final mile saw MIT's top three continue to move up, while the rest continued to lose ground. Wedge had an excellent race, particularly for a freshman, placing 64th in 25:50. Serene placed 69th in 25:56 while Harper finished 74th in 25:59. Welle made the most of a bad situation, finishing in 26:15 in 107th position while Amarasiriwardena placed 137th in 26:26. Nevertheless, MIT placed 18th among the 47 teams and 6th among Division III teams. If the Engineers had had their normal deltas from Welle and Prevost, they would have placed 9th overall and 2nd among Division III teams.
    
    
                      
    
    In the sub-varsity races, Katy Gordon '11, ran an excellent race in leading the way for MIT in 19:21 with support from Maggie Lloyd '12, and Sarah Sprague '13 in 19:24 and 19:38 respectively. Jacob Young '13, and Joe Christopher '12, were the top two Tech runners in the sub-varsity race with respective times of 26:53 and 26:55.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT heads to the Connecticut College Invitational at the Harkness Memorial State Park, although many of their top seven will not be racing.

    **Eve and Wedge Lead MIT Women and Men to NEWMAC Titles**
    
    
                      
    
    October 30, 2010
    
    
                      
    
    MIT Men's and Women's Cross Country teams traveled to Moore State Park in Paxton, MA to defend their NEWMAC titles and were not disappointed with the result. The windy and cool day with temperatures in the low 50's and the very hilly course did nothing to slow down the Engineers who defended both titles successfully. The women finished first for the fourth consecutive year, scoring just 24 points, while the men recorded 29 points en route to their 13th consecutive victory--remaining the only team to ever win the title.
    
    
                      
    
    The women's race was expected to be a virtual dual meet between MIT and Wellesley College. In the first meeting of the two teams, Wellesley surprised Tech by going out fast on a flat course and stealing the victory. In two later meetings involving more competitive meets, MIT was able to run away from Wellesley. With the two teams focused on each other the strategy that would be employed was anyone's guess.
    
    
                      
    
    Wellesley sprinted to the front at the start with MIT close behind. The first mile had two very large hills with one equally long downhill. Even though Wellesley's runners were leading things, the pace was conservative at 6:08 for the mile split. The second mile finished at a slightly higher elevation than the first mile, having one long downhill and one very long, rocky uphill. Both teams pushed this mile as the lead group started to split up. Randelle Boots '13, of Wellesley was in a close battle with Katherine Eve '12, Tania Morimoto '12 and Alina Gatowski '11, of MIT. They powered through the second mile at 12:17, producing an even split race to that point. The third mile was predominantly downhill, finishing slightly higher than the lowest point of the course, which was the start. In the final downhill, Boots made a move that could not be matched by the MIT trio, leading her to the individual title at 18:25. Eve was somewhat close at 18:33 and was closely followed by Morimoto in 18:38 and Gatowski in 18:39. Wellesley had the next two finishers, but then MIT closed it out with two freshmen finishing seventh and eighth, Martina de Geus in 19:03 and Claire O'Connell in 19:08. MIT's depth was impressive as they had 10 of the first 19 runners.
    
    
                      
    
    The men's race was on the exact same first three miles as the women, but they then repeated most of the first two miles, meaning three additional large hills. Similar to how the women's race started, the men allowed the others teams to set the pace and Springfield College obliged with a quick sprint from the uphill start. MIT fell in behind, content to let others set the pace for the first mile. The leaders came through the mile in 5:18 with MIT's top group of Paul Welle '11, Richard Prevost '11, and Stephen Serene '12, back at 5:20. The second mile, being very hilly and rocky was another conservative effort, but MIT was now right with the leaders at 10:42 and freshman Roy Wedge had worked his way up to join the other three Engineers. The downhill third mile saw the race open up a bit with four MIT runners along with one Springfield and one Coast Guard runner as they came through in 15:41. The fourth mile had the two biggest hills and MIT was ready to attack them. However, Serene had coasted the downhill portion of the third mile and suffered a bad side stitch he was not prepared to endure. Also, Prevost lost contact with the group, losing 23 seconds to the leaders, who were now three, Welle, Wedge and Zach Pietras '13, of Springfield. Welle had broken out to a six second lead by the end of the fourth mile, coming through in 21:05. However, he was no match for Wedge on the downhill fifth mile. Wedge ran 4:57 in the final mile to win in 26:08 to Welle's second place finish in 26:12. Prevost recovered to run a fine fifth mile and finish fifth in 26:37. Dan Harper '12, not having his best day, performed well enough to finish ninth in 26:59. Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, had a solid finish in 12th place to give MIT the victory.
    
    
                      
    
    In addition to the two team victories, MIT also earned both Freshman of the Year Awards with de Geus earning it for the women and Wedge winning it for the men. Wedge also earned Runner of the Year with his victory.
    
    
                      
    
    The Engineers are off from racing until the NCAA Regional Qualifier at Williams College on November 13.

    **Men Tie for First
                            Place, Women Finish Fourth in Purple Valley Invitational**
    
    
                      
    
    September 25, 2010
    
    
                      
    
    For the fourth Saturday in succession,
                        the weather was sunny with temperatures in the 70's, not
                        ideal for cross country, but good enough for the hilly course
                        in the Purple Valley Classic hosted
                        by Williams College.  The runners took advantage of
                        the national class fields and ran superb performances.  MIT's
                        men, ranked 29th in NCAA Division III, should move up significantly
                        as they tied #18 Keene State with 90 points while defeating
                        #23 Amherst College and #13 Williams College, among the 18
                        schools competing. The lady harriers from Tech were not as
                        fortunate.  Racing
                        without three of their top eight runners, missing for precautionary
                        measures, the Engineers were not able to pack in well enough
                        to defeat #2 ranked Middlebury College, who won the meet
                        with 57 points, #8 Williams College, second with 76 points
                        and #9 John's Hopkins, third with 86 points.  MIT finished
                        fourth among the 19 teams with 102 points.
    
    
                      
    
    In the men's 8K race, MIT got off the line
                        well and settled in to the early pace.  Paul Welle '11,
                        worked his way to the front of the pack in the  second mile
                        after coming through the first mile in 5:12 and hitting the
                        second mile in 10:37.  Stephen
                        Serene '12, Dan Harper '12 and Richard Prevost '11 had formed
                        a nice group by the end of the second mile, 11 second behind
                        Welle.  Roy Wedge '14, began the race more conservatively
                        with splits of 5:23 and 10:57.  In the third mile Welle
                        stayed with the leaders, running a 5:09 on the flat part
                        of the course.  Serene and Prevost continued to work
                        together, putting in 5:15 miles while Harper fell two seconds
                        back.  Wedge began to close the gap, putting in a 5:09
                        mile himself to move within a second of Harper.  In
                        the fourth mile, Welle could no longer stay with the leaders
                        on the large hill, falling back to sixth place.  Serene
                        and Wedge moved up well, passing those who could not handle
                        the hill.  Prevost had a poor mile, falling 38 seconds
                        behind Welle.  Harper maintained his position and was
                        only 33 seconds behind Welle.  In the final mile, Welle
                        was very fatigued, but only lost three more places to finish
                        in ninth place since the race had become so strung out.  Serene
                        and Wedge closed hard with 5:16 miles to place 14th and 16th
                        respectively.  Prevost rallied with a 5:17 to move back
                        to 24th place and Harper closed pretty well in 5:24 to finish
                        in 27th position.  The 29 second delta was superb and
                        good enough to earn the share of victory for MIT despite
                        not having a front runner at the finish.
    
    
                      
    
    The women thought they would be racing everyone
                        in their top eight, but two days before the race, Anna Holt-Gosselin
                        '11, and Olivia Papa '14, came up with quad strains that
                        warranted a cautious approach, thus the decision to not race
                        the challenging 6K.  Emma
                        Broderick '14, running 18:32 in her first cross country race
                        ever, also had to miss the race, leaving MIT a bit thin up
                        front.  Similarly to the men, the women got out well
                        at the start and appeared in perfect position to take control
                        of the race in the second mile. However, only Tania Morimoto
                        '12, was out with the leaders, which included four runners
                        from John's Hopkins and two from Williams.  Alina
                        Gatowski '11, and Katherine Eve '12, were in a great position
                        to move up but with Eve suffering from a cold and Gatowski
                        feeling fatigued, neither could respond as Middlebury came
                        racing by. Morimoto was 5:56 in the first mile and ran
                        an excellent second mile in 5:57.  Morimoto was 11 seconds
                        ahead of Gatowski at the two mile mark with Eve another three
                        seconds back.  Freshmen Martina de Geus, Claire O'Connell
                        and Sherry Fu came through in 12:17, 12:20 and 12:30 respectively.  The
                        hilly third mile took its toll on the MIT runners as the
                        top runners from Middlebury, Williams and John's Hopkins
                        put themselves ahead of all MIT runners.  Middlebury
                        put three runners ahead of MIT's top three and then three
                        more ahead of de Geus, who finished in an excellent 25th
                        place.  Williams
                        had two in front of Morimoto, MIT's top finisher in 11th
                        place and then two more ahead of de Geus and three more ahead
                        of O'Connell. John's Hopkins faded from the start but were
                        still ahead of MIT by virtue of putting three runners ahead
                        of Morimoto.  Gatowski closed well in the final .75
                        mile to finish in 13th and Eve was just behind in 15th.  O'Connell
                        fade a bit more, but ran tough to finish in 41st place. Fu
                        finished close behind in 54th place out of the 210 finishers.
    
    
                      
    
    While the men presented themselves as one of
                        the top teams in New England Division III and the women failed
                        again to get everyone to the starting line, there are still
                        seven weeks to go before the regional championships, plenty
                        of time for MIT to get even stronger and put everything together.  In
                        two weeks, MIT will be back at Franklin Park for the All
                        New England Championship, a race pitting all the colleges
                        in New England against each other from Division I, II and
                        III.  Last year, the women finished fourth while the
                        men earned 29th place.

    **Men and Women Both
                            Claim Runner-up Spots in UMass Dartmouth Invitational**
    
    
                      
    
    September 18, 2010
    
    
                      
    
    In the first real test for MIT, the Engineers
                        ran nearly their full teams at the UMass
                        Dartmouth Invitational.  The
                        weather was a little warm and humid for cross country, but
                        as nice as is likely at this point in September.  Of
                        the four races, varsity and sub-varsity for both genders,
                        MIT placed second in the two varsity and men's sub varsity
                        races, while winning the women's sub-varsity contest.  
    
    
                      
    
    The men's varsity 8K race featured nationally
                        ranked teams from Brandeis (10th) and Keene State (18th)
                        among the 36 teams.  Being
                        a very flat course with only a minor hill in the third mile,
                        the pace was very fast from the start.  Paul Welle '11, was
                        a few seconds back of the leaders at the mile mark, along
                        with Dan Harper '12, Richard Prevost '11 and Gihan Amarasiriwardena
                        '11, at 4:53.  The second mile slowed marginally as
                        Welle came through in 9:54 as he moved closer to the leaders.  Prevost
                        and Amarasiriwardena could not handle the early pace and
                        began to fade to between six and fifteen seconds behind
                        their teammate.  By mile three, Harper and Stephen Serene
                        '12 were moving up on the lead group and freshmen Roy Wedge
                        and Matt Metlitz were within striking distance.  In
                        the slightly downhill fourth mile Welle made a nice move
                        to pull up even with the leaders and looked very strong.   Wedge
                        ran a great 4:50 fourth mile to pull up to Serene and Harper,
                        but Metlitz, while running very well, was unable to move
                        up to that group.  In the final mile Welle got outkicked,
                        finishing fourth in a remarkable time of 24:51.  Both
                        Keene State and Brandeis faded during the race, while MIT
                        moved up, but not enough to catch Keene State, who finished
                        with 73 points.  Tech finished strong with 76 points
                        as Harper (13th - 25:07), Serene (15th - 25:09), Wedge (17th
                        - 25:10) and Metlitz (36th - 25:42) nearly won the meet.  Brandeis,
                        minus their top runner, finished with 79 points.
    
    
                      
    
    In the sub-varsity race, which MIT lost to
                        Brandeis, Logan Trimble '13 and Jay McKenna '14, led the
                        Engineers with third and fifth place respectively, running
                        26:06 and 26:12.  Other scorers for MIT were Joe Christopher
                        '12 (26:29) in 10th, Matt Weaver '12 (26:33) in 13th, and
                        Andrew Erickson '12 (26:41) in 15th.
    
    
                      
    
    The women, ranked 7th in the country, figured
                        they would be tested by Wellesley College and possibly by
                        Keene State, but despite not running one of their top four
                        and another of their top seven, MIT was confident in their
                        abilities to win the 5K race.  Wellesley went out fast,
                        clearly showing they were not intimidated by MIT. At
                        the 1K, Wellesley had the top five runners with the two lead
                        MIT runners at least seven seconds back. At the mile
                        mark, the leaders came through in a blazing 5:30.  Alina
                        Gatowski '11 and Tania Morimoto '12, were back at 5:40, but
                        ahead of the pace MIT wanted.  Back at 5:46 was Anna
                        Holt-Gosselin '11, and the freshmen Martina de Geus and Claire
                        O'Connell were fast at 5:51, but it was necessary to get
                        out given the fast pace of the leaders, and even with that
                        there were more than 100 runners in front of them.  Olivia
                        Papa '14, got out slow and was having trouble catching up
                        with her group as she came through in 5:56.  At mile
                        two, Morimoto had caught the leaders and Gatowski was just
                        four seconds back at 11:35.  Holt-Gosselin was moving
                        up in the field but falling further behind Morimoto and Gatowski.  de
                        Geus, O'Connell and Papa were now together between 12:03
                        and 12:06 and moving up well. The final mile was very
                        fast with the winner, Paige Mills from Keene State running
                        around a 5:30 to easily win.  Gatowski ran a 5:50 to
                        finish fourth in 18:01.  Morimoto placed seventh in
                        18:18, Holt-Gosselin ninth in 18:22, de Geus 17th in 18:38,
                        O'Connell 18th in 18:39 and Papa 19th in 18:42.  MIT's
                        45 points were only four behind Wellesley, lost it on their
                        fourth and fifth placed runners.  Keene State was third
                        with 93 points out of the 39 teams.
    
    
                      
    
    In the women's sub-varsity race, Emma Broderick
                        '14, surprised everyone with a second place finish and time
                        of 18:32 in her first cross country race ever, at any level.  MIT
                        also placed 3-4-5-9 out of 208 runners, by Maggie Lloyd '12,
                        Sarah Sprague '13, Sherry Fu '14, and Juliann Lajoie '13,
                        to easily win the race. 
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT travels to Williams College
                        for the Purple Valley Invitational run at their course at
                        Mt. Greylock HS.  There will be many of the best teams
                        in New England as well as a couple of nationally ranked teams
                        from outside the region participating in the race.
