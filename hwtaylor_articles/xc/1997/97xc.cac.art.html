This past Saturday, the MIT men's cross country team returned
to Institute Park at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with hopes
of winning the Constitution Athletic Conference title for a sixth
consecutive year. Earlier this year, MIT cruised to victory at
Institute park and this race was a sure way to measure the team's
progress as it prepares for National Qualifiers.<BR>

<P>
The harriers were well aware that to win the conference title
for the seventh time in eight years the team would have to out
race an impressive squad from the United States Coast Guard Academy.
When the gun sounded, and over one hundred runners thundered down
the first straight away, it was immediately apparent that Coast
Guard had planned on taking the title away from the Engineers.
Coast Guard started the race extremely fast, with their top runner
leading the race, and with enough in the front pack to steal a
win.<BR>

<P>
Aware that the team's title hopes were in trouble, co-captain
Mike Parkins '99 and Chris McGuire '00 responded, intelligently
waiting to make a move on the lead runner. Parkins and McGuire
had let the Coast Guard runner take a 50 meter lead before they
reeled him in and watched him suffer in a pointless attempt to
keep up. MIT's dynamic duo outperformed the competition once again,
as Parkins earned Runner of the Year Honors, winning in a course
record 25:40. McGuire also finished under the old course record
time and was awarded All-Conference Honors as he claimed second
place in 25:43 to finish off MIT's lethal one-two combo.<BR>

<P>
As Coast Guard runners followed by placing 3rd. 4th, and 5th,
the team title was still up for grabs. Co-captain Rich Rosalez
'98 battled several lead runners from other conference schools
and steadily moved his way up from 15th place at the first mile
to a 7th place finish in 26:37. Rosalez also earned All-Conference
honors for finishing in the top ten, and like McGuire and Parkins,
he took over a minute off his time from the race at Institute
Park earlier in the season.  Coast Guard's depth was too much
for the Engineers after that point, as the Bears captured 8th
and 9th to seal the victory. Mark Strauss was not far behind,
taking eleventh place in 26:49 on the wet and winding five mile
course. Sohail Husain improved tremendously to finish in 12th
place in 27:08, guaranteeing MIT a second place finish. Phil Loiselle
'01 and Liyan Guo '01 rounded out the Engineers top seven, finishing
in 15th and 17th place respectively.<BR>

<P>
Several other runners had noteable performances. Ray Molnar '00
and Frank Johnston '00 ran together and stayed close to the varisty
runners as they finished 19th and 20th. A pack of freshmen, who
worked together throuhgout the race, finished next, as Jeff Billing
'01, Ken Walker '01, and Aaron Adler '01, placed 23rd, 24th, and
26th. Ryan Peoples '00 also finished. In the last cross country
race of his career, Chuck Van Buren '98 finished 40th, improving
over a minute throughout the season. <BR>

<P>
Ed Keehr '01 finished next for MIT, in 50th, and Gus Blomquist
'99 narrowly edged Dave Kelman '99 to follow. Stanley Hu '00,
Reid Anderson '01, and Amay Champaneria '01 continued to improve,
as Anderson and Champaneria both finished the season with their
best performance thus far. Albert Hung '01, Kaoru Aou '00, and
Gerardo Martinez '99 also ran strong. Rob Cox '01 and Ashley Claybourne
'99 round out the harrier's impressive roster, ranked as high
as 16th in the nation this season.<BR>

<P>
Coast Guard finished ahead of MIT on the day by a score of 29
to 35, as both schools finished well ahead of third place Springfield's
78 points.  After the race, Parkins had this to say, &quot;I'm
deeeply honored to be Runner of the Year. I'm really happy with
the way I've been improving, but I'm mad at coach for cutting
my playing time each meet.&quot; <BR>

<P>
Rosalez added, &quot;We've got our work cut out for us at National
Qualifiers.  We are in an unfamiliar position right now, in that
we are not expected to make National Championships because the
competitionin New England is so intense this year. This team has
tremendous potential and if we run like we are capable of, we'll
make Nationals. I'm confident of that.&quot;<BR>

<P>
The MIT harriers have compiled a record of 53-23 while defeating
numerous Division I schools and nationally ranked Division III
schools.  Next Saturday, the Engineers will travel to the University
of Southern Maine for New England Division III Championships.
The team hopes to earn a birth for National Championships and
Parkins and McGuire expect to qualify individually.<BR>
