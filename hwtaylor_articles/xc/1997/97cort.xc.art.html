RANKING WITH STRONG  SHOWING IN NEW YORK<BR>

<FONT FACE="Bookman">Cortland, September 27 -- The MIT Men's Cross-Country
team took a giant step forward with a solid second-place finish
at the 15th Annual Cortland Invitational at SUNY-Cortland.  The
meet attracted a competitive 17-team field only slightly off the
caliber of last year's 25-team war. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> The Engineers tallied 109 points, trailing
only the 81 posted by St. Lawrence University -- a team ranked
16th in the nation in the most recent coaches' poll.  Third place
went to the host school, SUNY-Cortland (currently ranked #17)
with 113 points.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> MIT's harriers showed good up-front strength,
and nice supporting depth.  The gap between the two is still a
concern, but it has closed steadily as the season has progressed.
 Sophomore Chris McGuire and junior co-captain Mike Parkins raced
together for the 5.0-mile, mostly flat, grassy circuit, hitting
the finish in 4th and 6th place, respectively.  McGuire's 25:45
is a new MIT course record, taking it away from Parkins, whose
25:48 also bested his mark by 46 seconds.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> Freshman Mark Strauss made up for a slow
getaway by moving up through the field for a 20th-place finish,
clocking 26:34, essentially matching Parkins' 1996 time.  Strauss,
who has been running impressive races in his debut season, just
didn't get off the line well, and found himself well back in the
hard-charging field.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> Running another strong race, as MIT's fourth
man, was senior co-captain Rich Rosalez, whose 35th place in 26:58
was a lifetime personal best for 5-miles.  Rosalez, who sat out
much of last year with knee problems, is back to full strength
and has been solid as a rock.  He has closed the gap behind the
leaders every race, chopping it down to 1:13 this time.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> Behind Rosalez, things get bunched up nicely.
 A deep freshman class has added to a developing sophomore tier,
and given the Engineers a good group of runners tangling for spots
5 through 14.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> Senior Sohail Husain was fifth man in the
Tufts-Bates tri-meet, and was running aggressively for that position
again in Cortland, trying to match Rosalez' pace and tighten the
five-man time spread even more.  His aggressiveness had a price,
however, and he faded in the fourth mile, giving way to freshman
Phil Loiselle, who pulled away with a 5:07 final mile en route
to a huge personal best time of 27:02, good for 44th place, clinching
the runner-up spot in the team battle.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> Husain held the sixth man spot in 27:25,
a 70-second improvement over his 1996 time, and still within 1:40
of McGuire.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> Sophomore Frank Johnston held down the seventh
spot, recording his best time of the year, 27:32, in 63rd place.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> Despite the success of the varsity squad,
perhaps the Star of the Day Award would go to freshman Liyan Guo,
who conquered the field and won the JV race.  Guo ran an intelligently-paced
race, moving up steadily through the field -- 12th at 1-mile,
7th at 2-miles, 3rd at 3, 2nd at 4 -- and overtaking the leader
in the final 600 yards to win going away in 27:18, a lifetime
best by well over a minute.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> The J.V. finished third with 70 points,
narrowly being edged out for second by Fredonia, who tallied 69.
 Cortland won the race with 53.   Freshman Aaron Adler took 12th
in a PR 28:11, with ever-improving sophomore Ray Molnar right
behind in 15th at 28:12 (bettering his '96 race here by more than
four minutes).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> Freshmen Ken Walker (23rd, 28:35 PR), and
Jeff Billing (27th, 28:46) closed out the scoring.  Another strong
improvement was shown by soph Ryan Peoples, whose 28:49 in 29th
place was a personal best by 50 seconds, and three minutes better
than '96.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> This weekend promises fireworks aplenty,
with a Pre-Nationals Invitational being hosted by MIT at Franklin
Park.  Nationally-ranked teams from all over the US will be in
attendance, looking to knock heads with some tough competition
on the National Championship course.  Four top ten men's teams
will be there:  number-two ranked North Central (IL) heads the
field, with local challengers from Tufts (#5) and Brandeis (#7)
as well as Haverford (#10) in the mix.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> The men's Varsity race commences at 12:30.
 Sub-varsity is at 11:30, and the women's races are at 10:30 (SV)
and 11:00 (V).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Bookman"> Plenty of good seats are still available.
