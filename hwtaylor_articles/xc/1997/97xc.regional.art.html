GORHAM, MAINE (November 15) -- It was more suited for cross-country
skkiing than it was for cross-country running, but amid a six-inch
blanket of freshly-fallen snow, 190 runners representing 31 schools,
attacked the Gorham Country Club 5-mile layout in search of qualifying
berths for the NCAA Division III Championships.  The top three
teams, and the top six individuals who were not already on those
teams, would earn the right to compete for the National Title
this Saturday at Franklin Park.  The meet is being hosted by MIT.
<P>
 Junior co-captain Mike Parkins ran a strong and steady race,
placing 13th overall in a solid (given the conditions) time of
27:16.  Only 7 runners could break the normally-soft 27-minute
barrier.  Though he ran well, and charged valiantly over the final
mile, Parkins came up three seconds shy of the man he needed to
catch, and placed seventh in the race for the individual qualifying
spots.  His performance did earn him All-New England honors.
<P>
 The team was undaunted by the circumstances -- as evidenced by
their being the only squad to tour the course in the wind-whipped
stinging snowfall the previous day -- and raced to an 8th-place
finish with 241 points, nearly matching the 7th-place recorded
by the 1996 harriers.  
<P>
 Williams College totaled 68 points to garner the victory, with
Brandeis close behind with 74.  Surprising Keene State rallied
for the critical third spot, edging out Tufts, who had been ranked
as high as 7th nationally, by three points, 95-98.   Bates took
5th, Amherst 6th, and Bowdoin 7th.  The Engineers did exact a
small measure of revenge by beating CAC Champion Coast Guard by
48 points.
<P>
 It is difficult to gauge the quality of the performance for the
rest of the team, given the highly erratic mud-and-ice terrain.
 Times are largely irrelevant, given that the winner, Robert Mitchell
from Amherst College, who clocked a 24:03 at Franklin Park in
the New Englands, managed only 26:16 on this tundra.
<P>
 Sophomore Chris McGuire fought his way to a 26th place, also
earning All-New England status (top 35), in a normally-pedestrian
27:50.   The footing seemed to work against McGuire, whose low
stride style may not have yielded as much traction as the piston-like
leg mechanics of some of the other runners (Parkins, for example).
<P>
 The Next Engineers was senior Sohail Husain, who earned the #3-man
spot for the first time with a very solid performance.  Husain
got out well in the large field and maintained good position throughout
the race, finishing in 56th place in 28:50, just a minute behind
McGuire.  
<P>
 Co-captain Rich Rosalez had a strong first half, but faded somewhat
as the race wore on.  His 66th-place finish (29:11) was a milestone
performance; it was his first time in this meet, and it marked
the first time that he has completed an MIT CC season.  His previous
years have all found him on the injured list by season's end.
<P>
 Sophomore Frank Johnston, who ran as seventh or eighth man on
average for the season, justified the faith put in him, and raced
well to be MIT's #5 finisher in 87th place (29:50).  
<P>
 Freshman Mark Strauss did not have one of his better days, and
struggled to 104th (30:15).   This final race was not indicative
of the strong and aggressive season that he had.  MIT looks forward
to many quality races from Mark.
<P>
 Number seven man on the day was sophomore Ray Molnar, in 113th
(30:33).  Ray was ninth man through the season, but came on strong
at the end.  Assigned to keep training for the two weeks following
the Conference Championships, Ray ran such impressive workouts
that he was given the nod to run at Gorham.  Making the most of
his opportunity to contribute, Molnar got out very well, and ran
a very aggressive first 5K.  His zeal did eventually give way
to fatigue, and his teammates reeled him in.
<P>
 
<P>
 The season ended here, with the harriers posting an win-loss
record of 71-30 against all opponents.  Rosalez and Husain are
the only seniors in the top dozen on the squad.  With Parkins,
McGuire and Strauss back next year, and red-shirted junior Leif
Seed returning from his studies abroad, Cross-Country at MIT looks
strong for 1998.
<P>
 Some season tickets are still available.
