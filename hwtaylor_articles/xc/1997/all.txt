    RANKING WITH STRONG  SHOWING IN NEW YORK  
    
    
    
    
    
    Cortland, September 27 -- The MIT Men's Cross-Country
    team took a giant step forward with a solid second-place finish
    at the 15th Annual Cortland Invitational at SUNY-Cortland.  The
    meet attracted a competitive 17-team field only slightly off the
    caliber of last year's 25-team war. 
    
    
    
     The Engineers tallied 109 points, trailing
    only the 81 posted by St. Lawrence University -- a team ranked
    16th in the nation in the most recent coaches' poll.  Third place
    went to the host school, SUNY-Cortland (currently ranked #17)
    with 113 points.
    
    
    
     MIT's harriers showed good up-front strength,
    and nice supporting depth.  The gap between the two is still a
    concern, but it has closed steadily as the season has progressed.
     Sophomore Chris McGuire and junior co-captain Mike Parkins raced
    together for the 5.0-mile, mostly flat, grassy circuit, hitting
    the finish in 4th and 6th place, respectively.  McGuire's 25:45
    is a new MIT course record, taking it away from Parkins, whose
    25:48 also bested his mark by 46 seconds.
    
    
    
     Freshman Mark Strauss made up for a slow
    getaway by moving up through the field for a 20th-place finish,
    clocking 26:34, essentially matching Parkins' 1996 time.  Strauss,
    who has been running impressive races in his debut season, just
    didn't get off the line well, and found himself well back in the
    hard-charging field.
    
    
    
     Running another strong race, as MIT's fourth
    man, was senior co-captain Rich Rosalez, whose 35th place in 26:58
    was a lifetime personal best for 5-miles.  Rosalez, who sat out
    much of last year with knee problems, is back to full strength
    and has been solid as a rock.  He has closed the gap behind the
    leaders every race, chopping it down to 1:13 this time.  
    
    
    
     Behind Rosalez, things get bunched up nicely.
     A deep freshman class has added to a developing sophomore tier,
    and given the Engineers a good group of runners tangling for spots
    5 through 14.
    
    
    
     Senior Sohail Husain was fifth man in the
    Tufts-Bates tri-meet, and was running aggressively for that position
    again in Cortland, trying to match Rosalez' pace and tighten the
    five-man time spread even more.  His aggressiveness had a price,
    however, and he faded in the fourth mile, giving way to freshman
    Phil Loiselle, who pulled away with a 5:07 final mile en route
    to a huge personal best time of 27:02, good for 44th place, clinching
    the runner-up spot in the team battle.
    
    
    
     Husain held the sixth man spot in 27:25,
    a 70-second improvement over his 1996 time, and still within 1:40
    of McGuire.
    
    
    
     Sophomore Frank Johnston held down the seventh
    spot, recording his best time of the year, 27:32, in 63rd place.
    
    
    
     Despite the success of the varsity squad,
    perhaps the Star of the Day Award would go to freshman Liyan Guo,
    who conquered the field and won the JV race.  Guo ran an intelligently-paced
    race, moving up steadily through the field -- 12th at 1-mile,
    7th at 2-miles, 3rd at 3, 2nd at 4 -- and overtaking the leader
    in the final 600 yards to win going away in 27:18, a lifetime
    best by well over a minute.
    
    
    
     The J.V. finished third with 70 points,
    narrowly being edged out for second by Fredonia, who tallied 69.
     Cortland won the race with 53.   Freshman Aaron Adler took 12th
    in a PR 28:11, with ever-improving sophomore Ray Molnar right
    behind in 15th at 28:12 (bettering his '96 race here by more than
    four minutes).
    
    
    
     Freshmen Ken Walker (23rd, 28:35 PR), and
    Jeff Billing (27th, 28:46) closed out the scoring.  Another strong
    improvement was shown by soph Ryan Peoples, whose 28:49 in 29th
    place was a personal best by 50 seconds, and three minutes better
    than '96.
    
    
    
     This weekend promises fireworks aplenty,
    with a Pre-Nationals Invitational being hosted by MIT at Franklin
    Park.  Nationally-ranked teams from all over the US will be in
    attendance, looking to knock heads with some tough competition
    on the National Championship course.  Four top ten men's teams
    will be there:  number-two ranked North Central (IL) heads the
    field, with local challengers from Tufts (#5) and Brandeis (#7)
    as well as Haverford (#10) in the mix.
    
    
    
     The men's Varsity race commences at 12:30.
     Sub-varsity is at 11:30, and the women's races are at 10:30 (SV)
    and 11:00 (V).
    
    
    
     Plenty of good seats are still available.
      
    
      
    
    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    HARRIERS STORM FRANKLIN PARK
    IN NEW ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIPS  
    
    
    
    
    
    BOSTON, OCTOBER 17 -- Racing on a classic
    autumn afternoon, on a bone-dry, even dusty, Franklin Park, the
    MIT Men's Cross-Country Team launched an assault on the school's
    all-time time list for the standardized course. Eighteen of the
    twenty-two competitors recorded personal best times, many of then
    by more than thirty seconds.
    
    
    
    Team-wise, the Beavers placed 14th in a 36-team
    field that included the best Division I showing in several years.
    Brown took home the title with 55 points, with Dartmouth (90),
    Boston College (118), and Providence (134) giving best pursuit.
    
    
    
    In the Division III arena, Brandeis continued
    their strong running, placing 8th overall with 269 points (edging
    out Harvard's 271) to start the D3 parade. Williams was 10th (274),
    Tufts 11th (317), Amherst 12th (388) mainly on the strength of
    Rob Mitchell's 3rd-place individual finish in 24:03, Bates 13th
    (402), and MIT 14th (409). 
    
    
    
    The Beavers demonstrated remarkable team
    running. Throughout the crowded field (251 runners), junior co-captain
    Mike Parkins and sophomore Chris McGuire raced shoulder-to-shoulder,
    pushing each other to personal record [PR] times of 24:58 and
    25:00. Only Ethan Crain's 24:40 (good for 7th place) in the 1994
    New Englands is faster on the MIT list. Both runners moved ahead
    of Jesse Darley's 25:08, record in the same race (17th). McGuire
    took 34th place to Parkins' 36th.
    
    
    
    Freshman Mark Strauss, who had run one of
    his strongest races on this course in the Pre-Nationals two weeks
    before, just didn't have all tumblers clicking and ran 25:50 for
    91st. [His PR 25:34 would have netted him 70th.]
    
    
    
    The next wave of Beavers was led by co-captain
    Rich Rosalez's 26:16 PR (123rd), a 45-second best for him on this
    course. Freshman Phil Loiselle (26:21 PR, 129th) continues to
    impress, using his miler's speed to pull away from senior teammate
    Sohail Husain (26:30 PR, 139th) in the final flat field. Sophomore
    Frank Johnston once again flirted with his PR (set last year in
    NE's, 16:48) but came up a few seconds shy (16:52, 163rd).
    
    
    
    The J.V. race continued the onslaught of
    time breakthroughs, with freshman Liyan Guo setting the tone with
    his 26:40 PR (by 1:34!) in 41st place (out of 222 runners). Sophomore
    Ray Molnar just keeps getting better as well, with his 27:14 lopping
    another 36 seconds off his personal best (Ray's best as a freshman
    was 29:33). Another substantial drop was posted by freshman Ken
    Walker, whose 27:36 clocking was a PR by 34 seconds, and a 1:32
    improvement from the season opener.
    
    
    
    Other noteworthy bests were recorded by Jeff
    Billing '01 (27:38), Ed Keehr '01 (28:02), indoor track co-captain
    Chuck VanBuren '98 (28:04), Gus Blomquist '99 (28:22), and Ryan
    Peoples '00 (28:28).
    
    
    
    The next race for the Beaver Harriers will
    be Saturday, 25 October, in a 5000-meter clash with Bowdoin, Bates,
    and Colby in Brunswick, Maine. The meet figures to a battle among
    the 4th-, 5th-, and 6th-ranked teams in New England, with Bates
    rated ahead of MIT and Bowdoin. The race begins at 12:00 noon,
    and Bowdoin's Field House.
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    HARRIERS 6TH IN TOUGH PRE-NATIONALS
    FIELD  
    
    
    
    
    
    Boston, October 4 -- Talented teams from
    across the nation converged on Franklin Park for the National
    Preview Invitational, hosted by MIT. In all, eight of the top
    25 ranked Division 3 teams were in attendance, including four
    of the top ten. MIT put up a solid performance, placing 6th overall
    in the 15-team field, with 173 points.
    
    
    
    Perennial powerhouse North Central College
    from Illinois, currently ranked #2 in the country, ran a controlled
    race early on, then took command decisively, and romped to victory
    with 32 points. The NCC scorecard showed a 1-2 finish, with two
    more runners in the top eight. 
    
    
    
    Brandeis University, ranked #6 nationally
    coming in, secured second place with 83 points, with #10-ranked
    Haverford (PA) College tallying 90 for third place, UC-San Diego
    (#14) scoring 96 in fourth, and Tufts University (#5 in latest
    poll) taking the fifth with 114.
    
    
    
    The Engineers began the race with somewhat
    forced aggressiveness, as the field set a furious pace for the
    first mile. Junior co-captain Mike Parkins led sophomore Chris
    McGuire and freshman Mark Strauss through that point in 4:52,
    and found himself behind a pack of 15-20 runners. The field swarmed
    through behind them, and as MIT's second wave of senior Sohail
    Husain, sophomore Frank Johnston, and freshmen Phil Loiselle and
    Liyan Guo passed the mile post in 5:10, they found themselves
    with a horde of runners to catch.
    
    
    
    Parkins worked ahead in the second and third
    mile, moving up to 11th in 15:15 for 3-miles. McGuire got separated
    in the crowd and found himself dropping 8 seconds his teammate.
    Meanwhile, Strauss was hanging tough, just 3 seconds in arrears
    of McGuire.
    
    
    
    Husain took charge of the second pack, pushing
    his pace and pulling Johnston and Loiselle along in his wake.
    The trio passed through 3-miles in 16:10, on solid PR pace, and
    reeling in some of the more foolhardy entries.
    
    
    
    The final mile produced its usual fireworks.
    Parkins maintained his hard charge, but was overtaken by one runner
    and finished 12th in a PR 25:16 -- the third best MIT performer
    since this course was standardized
    in 1992. Only Ethan Crain's 24:40 and Jesse Darley's 25:06 in
    the 1994 All-New Englands are faster.
    
    
    
    Strauss overtook McGuire around Bear Cage
    Hill, and stormed to 23rd place in a PR 25:34 (#4 ever for MIT),
    with McGuire 26th in a near-PR 25:40. 
    
    
    
    Big PR's were posted by Loiselle (26:38 in
    55th place), and Husain (26:41 in 57th), to close out MIT's scoring.
    Johnston missed his PR by 3 seconds (26:51 in 61st).   
    
    
    
    
    
    In the Sub-Varsity race, PR's fell like bowling
    pins. Sophomore Ray Molnar led the attack on the time list by
    finishing 17th in 27:50, a PR by over a minute. Also bettering
    previous marks by such a margin were freshmen Aaron Adler (20th,
    27:56) and Ken Walker (24th, 28:10). Senior Chuck Van Buren, sophomore
    Stanley Hu, and freshmen Ed Keehr, Albert Hung, Reid Anderson,
    and Amay Champaneria all posted their all-time best clockings
    as well.  
    
    
    
    
    
    The Engineers' next contest will be on Friday,
    17 October, at Franklin Park in the New England Intercollegiate
    Amateur Athletic Association (NEIAAA) Championships. This race
    features the best competition of the season, with Division 1 and
    Division 2 teams lining up with we Division 3 squads to determine
    where we all stack up in the New England scene. The Engineers
    have historically run well against the elevated competition, as
    indicated by the fact that 17 of our top 25 all-time best performers
    at Franklin Park have run that time in the New Englands (four
    of the remaining eight did so in this Pre-Nationals race).
    
    
    
    The Varsity Race will start at 1:30, with
    the Sub-Varsity squad toeing the line at 2:30.  
    
    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **MIT Splits vs. Tufts and Bates  
    
    **
    
    
    
    GRAFTON, SEPTEMBER 20, 1997 -- The MIT Men's Cross-Country team
    ran their record to 3-1 by splitting a tri-meet with Tufts and
    Bates on Tufts brand new rural course at the Veterinary School
    in Grafton.
    
    
    
     Tufts won their ground-breaking meet with 31 points, MIT took
    second with 44, and Bates wound up third with 55.
    
    
    
     The meet was a measure of revenge for the Engineers after losing
    to both teams at Bates last fall.  Entering the contest, Tufts
    was ranked 3rd in N.E. Division 3 and 7th nationally, and Bates
    was ranked 4th (24th in the nation), to MIT's 6th.  The Engineers
    effort will surely move them up in the poll, and possibly into
    the national picture as well.
    
    
    
     Team co-captain Mike Parkins '99 led the Engineers with a strong
    second place finish, covering the challenging and hilly 5-mile
    course in 27:11.  The time was far off his best for the distance,
    but the difficulty of the terrain, coupled with the heat and high
    humidity, kept times slower throughout the field.  Chris McGuire
    '00 was the #2 runner in 27:29, placing fifth overall, and Mark
    Strauss '01 ran a solid race to earn 7th (27:53).
    
    
    
     The first portion of the race saw a pack of Tufts runners move
    to the fore -- polar opposite strategy from last year's race --
    with a couple of Bates runners and MIT's top three in the mix.
     
    
    
    
     By the third mile, Bates' Justin Freeman had moved into control
    of the race with Parkins at his side and Tufts' Jason Burke close
    behind.  McGuire had fallen slightly off the pace and headed the
    small second pack.  A few hundred yards behind him, MIT seniors
    Rich Rosalez and Sohail Husain were working their way past some
    fading Tufts and Bates runners, moving the team into contention.
    
    
    
        Freeman made his move before the 4-mile post, and opened a
    gap on Parkins.  Mike's final mile is typically his forte, and
    he matched Freeman stride-for-stride, but could not cut into his
    lead.  McGuire hit four miles in fourth place, but was overtaken
    in the final moments.  Rosalez finished his race strong, his steady
    workman's pace bringing him up to 12th in the 64-man field, and
    essentially clinching the win over Bates.  Husain ran a gutsy
    race, making the effort to break away from a tight pack of four
    Bates runners, but was overtaken by that pack in the final half-mile.
    
    
    
     Interim Head Coach Dick MacKenzie was generally pleased with
    the team's performance.  "The guys have better in them, I
    know, but they gave a good competitive effort against two very
    solid teams today.  We had several guys put up their best race
    of the season -- not timewise, perhaps, but time is less relevant
    in cross-country, especially on a new and unfamiliar course. 
    We had much better competition today, and I think we rose to meet
    it.  We were only six points down to Tufts at four miles, so I
    have to think we should be looking for good things as we move
    down the road."
    
    
    
     Other MIT runners who put up fine performances included Frank
    Johnston '00, the team's sixth man, who closed to within six seconds
    of Husain, and Phil Loiselle '01 who was only another four seconds
    in arrears as number seven.
    
    
    
     "We have a nice intra-team situation going on," said
    MacKenzie.  "Our top three race together well, and Rich is
    solidly our fourth man, but then we have a real mix duking it
    out for the number five, six, and seven spots.  Their scrappiness
    in trying to beat one another will make all of them improve.
    
    
    
     Sophomore Ray Molnar and freshman Ed Keehr both made great strides
    in the race as well, easily recording their best team finishes
    to date.
    
    
    
     MIT hits the road to New York this weekend, taking in the highly
    competitive Cortland Invitational at SUNY-Cortland.  A number
    of the nation's top-25 ranked teams will be in attendance.  Last
    year, the Engineers raced to seventh place in a 25-team field.
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **HARRIERS FALTER IN BOWDOIN 5K  
    
    **
    
    
    
    BRUNSWICK, MAINE -- In what has been a generally successful season,
    the MIT Engineers Men's Cross-Country team produced their first
    poor outing in a loss to both Bowdoin and Bates in the 1st Bowdoin
    Invitational last Saturday. The host school used excellent grouping
    to capture the win with 34 points. Their fifth man was a mere
    32 seconds behind their first. Bates captured second, behind the
    first-place finish of rebounding sophomore Matt Twiest. Their
    48 point just edged out MIT's total of 50.
    
    
    
    The setback should have dire effects on MIT's local and national
    rankings, potentially dropping the Beavers from their #6 spot
    in New England, and possibly sliding them off the list from their
    #23 national ranking.
    
    
    
    "We worked hard through this week," offered interim
    head coach Dick MacKenzie, " and I knew that would take some
    of the snap out of their legs. I didn't think it would take quite
    this much, though. There are some meets you train through, and
    some you focus on: this one we trained through. And with two solid
    opponents like this, we ended up taking some lumps."
    
    
    
    Junior co-captain Mike Parkins produced one of the best efforts
    of the day, barely losing to Twiest by four seconds (15:32). Parkins,
    with sophomore teammate Chris McGuire on his shoulder, set an
    aggressive pace with a 4:54 opening mile on the rain-softened
    turf. Twiest made a big move and took the lead just before the
    2-mile post, which they reached in 10:01. Parkins stayed on the
    Bates' runner's back into the final 600-yard straightaway, but
    was unable to find the extra gear to overhaul him.
    
    
    
    McGuire followed in third for most of the race, but was reeled
    in shortly before the line by Bowdoin's Mike Peyton, and had to
    settle for fourth (15:36).
    
    
    
    Senior Sohail Husain also produced a strong race, claiming the
    #3-Man slot for the first time this year, and finishing 12th in
    16:11. Senior co-captain Rich Rosalez was close behind in 15th
    in 16:15, and freshman Mark Strauss closed out the scoring in
    17th with a 16:18 clocking.
    
    
    
    Sophomore Frank Johnston fortified his hold on the #6-Man spot
    by running a smart and patient race, moving up through the field
    to finish 19th in 16:28. Freshmen Liyan Guo (16:32) and Phil Loiselle
    (16:35) followed close behind in 21st and 22nd. Also in the hunt
    for the top seven were sophomore Ray Molnar (26th, 16:43), and
    ever-improving freshman Ken Walker (27th, 16:48).
    
    
    
    For the season thus far, the Engineers have run up an overall
    record of 49-22, including all opponents in all races.  
    
    
    
    
    
    Daylight Savings Time is over, and that means that Championship
    Season is upon us. The Beavers return to Worcester Polytechnic
    Institute -- the scene of their Engineers' Cup triumph six weeks
    ago -- this Saturday to compete in the Constitution Athletic Conference
    Championship Meet. Prime opposition is expected to come from the
    U.S. Coast Guard Academy, whose team has looked solid each week.
    
    
    
    
    Also in the Conference are: Babson, Clark, Norwich, Springfield,
    Western New England, and the host school WPI.
    
    
    
    MIT won this meet last year with 30 points, outscoring both Coast
    Guard and Springfield, who tied for second with 55. Arnold Seto
    won the race to earn Runner of the Year honors, with Chris McGuire
    garnering Rookie of the Year laurels.
    
    
    
    In 1995, the meet was a barn-burner, with MIT prevailing over
    Coast Guard by a solitary point, 39-40. Ethan Crain's took the
    individual win in the slick mud, but it was then-freshman Mike
    Parkins' 1-second edge of Coast Guard's 3rd man, that was the
    difference.
    
    
    
    Since CAC was formed in 1990, MIT has claimed the Team Title all
    but once (3rd, in 1990), and Coast Guard has been second all but
    once (1st, in 1990). 
    
    
    
    The race is at Institute Park, adjacent to the WPI campus, and
    the gun fires at 11:00.

    This past Saturday, the MIT men's cross country team returned
    to Institute Park at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with hopes
    of winning the Constitution Athletic Conference title for a sixth
    consecutive year. Earlier this year, MIT cruised to victory at
    Institute park and this race was a sure way to measure the team's
    progress as it prepares for National Qualifiers.  
    
    
    
    
    
    The harriers were well aware that to win the conference title
    for the seventh time in eight years the team would have to out
    race an impressive squad from the United States Coast Guard Academy.
    When the gun sounded, and over one hundred runners thundered down
    the first straight away, it was immediately apparent that Coast
    Guard had planned on taking the title away from the Engineers.
    Coast Guard started the race extremely fast, with their top runner
    leading the race, and with enough in the front pack to steal a
    win.  
    
    
    
    
    
    Aware that the team's title hopes were in trouble, co-captain
    Mike Parkins '99 and Chris McGuire '00 responded, intelligently
    waiting to make a move on the lead runner. Parkins and McGuire
    had let the Coast Guard runner take a 50 meter lead before they
    reeled him in and watched him suffer in a pointless attempt to
    keep up. MIT's dynamic duo outperformed the competition once again,
    as Parkins earned Runner of the Year Honors, winning in a course
    record 25:40. McGuire also finished under the old course record
    time and was awarded All-Conference Honors as he claimed second
    place in 25:43 to finish off MIT's lethal one-two combo.  
    
    
    
    
    
    As Coast Guard runners followed by placing 3rd. 4th, and 5th,
    the team title was still up for grabs. Co-captain Rich Rosalez
    '98 battled several lead runners from other conference schools
    and steadily moved his way up from 15th place at the first mile
    to a 7th place finish in 26:37. Rosalez also earned All-Conference
    honors for finishing in the top ten, and like McGuire and Parkins,
    he took over a minute off his time from the race at Institute
    Park earlier in the season.  Coast Guard's depth was too much
    for the Engineers after that point, as the Bears captured 8th
    and 9th to seal the victory. Mark Strauss was not far behind,
    taking eleventh place in 26:49 on the wet and winding five mile
    course. Sohail Husain improved tremendously to finish in 12th
    place in 27:08, guaranteeing MIT a second place finish. Phil Loiselle
    '01 and Liyan Guo '01 rounded out the Engineers top seven, finishing
    in 15th and 17th place respectively.  
    
    
    
    
    
    Several other runners had noteable performances. Ray Molnar '00
    and Frank Johnston '00 ran together and stayed close to the varisty
    runners as they finished 19th and 20th. A pack of freshmen, who
    worked together throuhgout the race, finished next, as Jeff Billing
    '01, Ken Walker '01, and Aaron Adler '01, placed 23rd, 24th, and
    26th. Ryan Peoples '00 also finished. In the last cross country
    race of his career, Chuck Van Buren '98 finished 40th, improving
    over a minute throughout the season.   
    
    
    
    
    
    Ed Keehr '01 finished next for MIT, in 50th, and Gus Blomquist
    '99 narrowly edged Dave Kelman '99 to follow. Stanley Hu '00,
    Reid Anderson '01, and Amay Champaneria '01 continued to improve,
    as Anderson and Champaneria both finished the season with their
    best performance thus far. Albert Hung '01, Kaoru Aou '00, and
    Gerardo Martinez '99 also ran strong. Rob Cox '01 and Ashley Claybourne
    '99 round out the harrier's impressive roster, ranked as high
    as 16th in the nation this season.  
    
    
    
    
    
    Coast Guard finished ahead of MIT on the day by a score of 29
    to 35, as both schools finished well ahead of third place Springfield's
    78 points.  After the race, Parkins had this to say, "I'm
    deeeply honored to be Runner of the Year. I'm really happy with
    the way I've been improving, but I'm mad at coach for cutting
    my playing time each meet."   
    
    
    
    
    
    Rosalez added, "We've got our work cut out for us at National
    Qualifiers.  We are in an unfamiliar position right now, in that
    we are not expected to make National Championships because the
    competitionin New England is so intense this year. This team has
    tremendous potential and if we run like we are capable of, we'll
    make Nationals. I'm confident of that."  
    
    
    
    
    
    The MIT harriers have compiled a record of 53-23 while defeating
    numerous Division I schools and nationally ranked Division III
    schools.  Next Saturday, the Engineers will travel to the University
    of Southern Maine for New England Division III Championships.
    The team hopes to earn a birth for National Championships and
    Parkins and McGuire expect to qualify individually.  
    
    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    HARRIERS 8th IN NCAA QUALIFIER
    
    
    
    PARKINS JUST MISSES INDIVIDUAL BERTH  
    
    
    
    
    
    GORHAM, MAINE (November 15) -- It was more suited for cross-country
    skkiing than it was for cross-country running, but amid a six-inch
    blanket of freshly-fallen snow, 190 runners representing 31 schools,
    attacked the Gorham Country Club 5-mile layout in search of qualifying
    berths for the NCAA Division III Championships.  The top three
    teams, and the top six individuals who were not already on those
    teams, would earn the right to compete for the National Title
    this Saturday at Franklin Park.  The meet is being hosted by MIT.
    
    
    
     Junior co-captain Mike Parkins ran a strong and steady race,
    placing 13th overall in a solid (given the conditions) time of
    27:16.  Only 7 runners could break the normally-soft 27-minute
    barrier.  Though he ran well, and charged valiantly over the final
    mile, Parkins came up three seconds shy of the man he needed to
    catch, and placed seventh in the race for the individual qualifying
    spots.  His performance did earn him All-New England honors.
    
    
    
     The team was undaunted by the circumstances -- as evidenced by
    their being the only squad to tour the course in the wind-whipped
    stinging snowfall the previous day -- and raced to an 8th-place
    finish with 241 points, nearly matching the 7th-place recorded
    by the 1996 harriers.  
    
    
    
     Williams College totaled 68 points to garner the victory, with
    Brandeis close behind with 74.  Surprising Keene State rallied
    for the critical third spot, edging out Tufts, who had been ranked
    as high as 7th nationally, by three points, 95-98.   Bates took
    5th, Amherst 6th, and Bowdoin 7th.  The Engineers did exact a
    small measure of revenge by beating CAC Champion Coast Guard by
    48 points.
    
    
    
     It is difficult to gauge the quality of the performance for the
    rest of the team, given the highly erratic mud-and-ice terrain.
     Times are largely irrelevant, given that the winner, Robert Mitchell
    from Amherst College, who clocked a 24:03 at Franklin Park in
    the New Englands, managed only 26:16 on this tundra.
    
    
    
     Sophomore Chris McGuire fought his way to a 26th place, also
    earning All-New England status (top 35), in a normally-pedestrian
    27:50.   The footing seemed to work against McGuire, whose low
    stride style may not have yielded as much traction as the piston-like
    leg mechanics of some of the other runners (Parkins, for example).
    
    
    
     The Next Engineers was senior Sohail Husain, who earned the #3-man
    spot for the first time with a very solid performance.  Husain
    got out well in the large field and maintained good position throughout
    the race, finishing in 56th place in 28:50, just a minute behind
    McGuire.  
    
    
    
     Co-captain Rich Rosalez had a strong first half, but faded somewhat
    as the race wore on.  His 66th-place finish (29:11) was a milestone
    performance; it was his first time in this meet, and it marked
    the first time that he has completed an MIT CC season.  His previous
    years have all found him on the injured list by season's end.
    
    
    
     Sophomore Frank Johnston, who ran as seventh or eighth man on
    average for the season, justified the faith put in him, and raced
    well to be MIT's #5 finisher in 87th place (29:50).  
    
    
    
     Freshman Mark Strauss did not have one of his better days, and
    struggled to 104th (30:15).   This final race was not indicative
    of the strong and aggressive season that he had.  MIT looks forward
    to many quality races from Mark.
    
    
    
     Number seven man on the day was sophomore Ray Molnar, in 113th
    (30:33).  Ray was ninth man through the season, but came on strong
    at the end.  Assigned to keep training for the two weeks following
    the Conference Championships, Ray ran such impressive workouts
    that he was given the nod to run at Gorham.  Making the most of
    his opportunity to contribute, Molnar got out very well, and ran
    a very aggressive first 5K.  His zeal did eventually give way
    to fatigue, and his teammates reeled him in.
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
     The season ended here, with the harriers posting an win-loss
    record of 71-30 against all opponents.  Rosalez and Husain are
    the only seniors in the top dozen on the squad.  With Parkins,
    McGuire and Strauss back next year, and red-shirted junior Leif
    Seed returning from his studies abroad, Cross-Country at MIT looks
    strong for 1998.
    
    
    
     Some season tickets are still available.
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        HARRIERS PUSH FOR NATIONAL
        RANKING WITH STRONG  SHOWING IN NEW YORK  
        
        
        
        
        
        Cortland, September 27 -- The MIT Men's Cross-Country
        team took a giant step forward with a solid second-place finish
        at the 15th Annual Cortland Invitational at SUNY-Cortland.  The
        meet attracted a competitive 17-team field only slightly off the
        caliber of last year's 25-team war. 
        
        
        
         The Engineers tallied 109 points, trailing
        only the 81 posted by St. Lawrence University -- a team ranked
        16th in the nation in the most recent coaches' poll.  Third place
        went to the host school, SUNY-Cortland (currently ranked #17)
        with 113 points.
        
        
        
         MIT's harriers showed good up-front strength,
        and nice supporting depth.  The gap between the two is still a
        concern, but it has closed steadily as the season has progressed.
         Sophomore Chris McGuire and junior co-captain Mike Parkins raced
        together for the 5.0-mile, mostly flat, grassy circuit, hitting
        the finish in 4th and 6th place, respectively.  McGuire's 25:45
        is a new MIT course record, taking it away from Parkins, whose
        25:48 also bested his mark by 46 seconds.
        
        
        
         Freshman Mark Strauss made up for a slow
        getaway by moving up through the field for a 20th-place finish,
        clocking 26:34, essentially matching Parkins' 1996 time.  Strauss,
        who has been running impressive races in his debut season, just
        didn't get off the line well, and found himself well back in the
        hard-charging field.
        
        
        
         Running another strong race, as MIT's fourth
        man, was senior co-captain Rich Rosalez, whose 35th place in 26:58
        was a lifetime personal best for 5-miles.  Rosalez, who sat out
        much of last year with knee problems, is back to full strength
        and has been solid as a rock.  He has closed the gap behind the
        leaders every race, chopping it down to 1:13 this time.  
        
        
        
         Behind Rosalez, things get bunched up nicely.
         A deep freshman class has added to a developing sophomore tier,
        and given the Engineers a good group of runners tangling for spots
        5 through 14.
        
        
        
         Senior Sohail Husain was fifth man in the
        Tufts-Bates tri-meet, and was running aggressively for that position
        again in Cortland, trying to match Rosalez' pace and tighten the
        five-man time spread even more.  His aggressiveness had a price,
        however, and he faded in the fourth mile, giving way to freshman
        Phil Loiselle, who pulled away with a 5:07 final mile en route
        to a huge personal best time of 27:02, good for 44th place, clinching
        the runner-up spot in the team battle.
        
        
        
         Husain held the sixth man spot in 27:25,
        a 70-second improvement over his 1996 time, and still within 1:40
        of McGuire.
        
        
        
         Sophomore Frank Johnston held down the seventh
        spot, recording his best time of the year, 27:32, in 63rd place.
        
        
        
         Despite the success of the varsity squad,
        perhaps the Star of the Day Award would go to freshman Liyan Guo,
        who conquered the field and won the JV race.  Guo ran an intelligently-paced
        race, moving up steadily through the field -- 12th at 1-mile,
        7th at 2-miles, 3rd at 3, 2nd at 4 -- and overtaking the leader
        in the final 600 yards to win going away in 27:18, a lifetime
        best by well over a minute.
        
        
        
         The J.V. finished third with 70 points,
        narrowly being edged out for second by Fredonia, who tallied 69.
         Cortland won the race with 53.   Freshman Aaron Adler took 12th
        in a PR 28:11, with ever-improving sophomore Ray Molnar right
        behind in 15th at 28:12 (bettering his '96 race here by more than
        four minutes).
        
        
        
         Freshmen Ken Walker (23rd, 28:35 PR), and
        Jeff Billing (27th, 28:46) closed out the scoring.  Another strong
        improvement was shown by soph Ryan Peoples, whose 28:49 in 29th
        place was a personal best by 50 seconds, and three minutes better
        than '96.
        
        
        
         This weekend promises fireworks aplenty,
        with a Pre-Nationals Invitational being hosted by MIT at Franklin
        Park.  Nationally-ranked teams from all over the US will be in
        attendance, looking to knock heads with some tough competition
        on the National Championship course.  Four top ten men's teams
        will be there:  number-two ranked North Central (IL) heads the
        field, with local challengers from Tufts (#5) and Brandeis (#7)
        as well as Haverford (#10) in the mix.
        
        
        
         The men's Varsity race commences at 12:30.
         Sub-varsity is at 11:30, and the women's races are at 10:30 (SV)
        and 11:00 (V).
        
        
        
         Plenty of good seats are still available.
          
        
          
        
        
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        HARRIERS STORM FRANKLIN PARK
        IN NEW ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIPS  
        
        
        
        
        
        BOSTON, OCTOBER 17 -- Racing on a classic
        autumn afternoon, on a bone-dry, even dusty, Franklin Park, the
        MIT Men's Cross-Country Team launched an assault on the school's
        all-time time list for the standardized course. Eighteen of the
        twenty-two competitors recorded personal best times, many of then
        by more than thirty seconds.
        
        
        
        Team-wise, the Beavers placed 14th in a 36-team
        field that included the best Division I showing in several years.
        Brown took home the title with 55 points, with Dartmouth (90),
        Boston College (118), and Providence (134) giving best pursuit.
        
        
        
        In the Division III arena, Brandeis continued
        their strong running, placing 8th overall with 269 points (edging
        out Harvard's 271) to start the D3 parade. Williams was 10th (274),
        Tufts 11th (317), Amherst 12th (388) mainly on the strength of
        Rob Mitchell's 3rd-place individual finish in 24:03, Bates 13th
        (402), and MIT 14th (409). 
        
        
        
        The Beavers demonstrated remarkable team
        running. Throughout the crowded field (251 runners), junior co-captain
        Mike Parkins and sophomore Chris McGuire raced shoulder-to-shoulder,
        pushing each other to personal record [PR] times of 24:58 and
        25:00. Only Ethan Crain's 24:40 (good for 7th place) in the 1994
        New Englands is faster on the MIT list. Both runners moved ahead
        of Jesse Darley's 25:08, record in the same race (17th). McGuire
        took 34th place to Parkins' 36th.
        
        
        
        Freshman Mark Strauss, who had run one of
        his strongest races on this course in the Pre-Nationals two weeks
        before, just didn't have all tumblers clicking and ran 25:50 for
        91st. [His PR 25:34 would have netted him 70th.]
        
        
        
        The next wave of Beavers was led by co-captain
        Rich Rosalez's 26:16 PR (123rd), a 45-second best for him on this
        course. Freshman Phil Loiselle (26:21 PR, 129th) continues to
        impress, using his miler's speed to pull away from senior teammate
        Sohail Husain (26:30 PR, 139th) in the final flat field. Sophomore
        Frank Johnston once again flirted with his PR (set last year in
        NE's, 16:48) but came up a few seconds shy (16:52, 163rd).
        
        
        
        The J.V. race continued the onslaught of
        time breakthroughs, with freshman Liyan Guo setting the tone with
        his 26:40 PR (by 1:34!) in 41st place (out of 222 runners). Sophomore
        Ray Molnar just keeps getting better as well, with his 27:14 lopping
        another 36 seconds off his personal best (Ray's best as a freshman
        was 29:33). Another substantial drop was posted by freshman Ken
        Walker, whose 27:36 clocking was a PR by 34 seconds, and a 1:32
        improvement from the season opener.
        
        
        
        Other noteworthy bests were recorded by Jeff
        Billing '01 (27:38), Ed Keehr '01 (28:02), indoor track co-captain
        Chuck VanBuren '98 (28:04), Gus Blomquist '99 (28:22), and Ryan
        Peoples '00 (28:28).
        
        
        
        The next race for the Beaver Harriers will
        be Saturday, 25 October, in a 5000-meter clash with Bowdoin, Bates,
        and Colby in Brunswick, Maine. The meet figures to a battle among
        the 4th-, 5th-, and 6th-ranked teams in New England, with Bates
        rated ahead of MIT and Bowdoin. The race begins at 12:00 noon,
        and Bowdoin's Field House.
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        HARRIERS 6TH IN TOUGH PRE-NATIONALS
        FIELD  
        
        
        
        
        
        Boston, October 4 -- Talented teams from
        across the nation converged on Franklin Park for the National
        Preview Invitational, hosted by MIT. In all, eight of the top
        25 ranked Division 3 teams were in attendance, including four
        of the top ten. MIT put up a solid performance, placing 6th overall
        in the 15-team field, with 173 points.
        
        
        
        Perennial powerhouse North Central College
        from Illinois, currently ranked #2 in the country, ran a controlled
        race early on, then took command decisively, and romped to victory
        with 32 points. The NCC scorecard showed a 1-2 finish, with two
        more runners in the top eight. 
        
        
        
        Brandeis University, ranked #6 nationally
        coming in, secured second place with 83 points, with #10-ranked
        Haverford (PA) College tallying 90 for third place, UC-San Diego
        (#14) scoring 96 in fourth, and Tufts University (#5 in latest
        poll) taking the fifth with 114.
        
        
        
        The Engineers began the race with somewhat
        forced aggressiveness, as the field set a furious pace for the
        first mile. Junior co-captain Mike Parkins led sophomore Chris
        McGuire and freshman Mark Strauss through that point in 4:52,
        and found himself behind a pack of 15-20 runners. The field swarmed
        through behind them, and as MIT's second wave of senior Sohail
        Husain, sophomore Frank Johnston, and freshmen Phil Loiselle and
        Liyan Guo passed the mile post in 5:10, they found themselves
        with a horde of runners to catch.
        
        
        
        Parkins worked ahead in the second and third
        mile, moving up to 11th in 15:15 for 3-miles. McGuire got separated
        in the crowd and found himself dropping 8 seconds his teammate.
        Meanwhile, Strauss was hanging tough, just 3 seconds in arrears
        of McGuire.
        
        
        
        Husain took charge of the second pack, pushing
        his pace and pulling Johnston and Loiselle along in his wake.
        The trio passed through 3-miles in 16:10, on solid PR pace, and
        reeling in some of the more foolhardy entries.
        
        
        
        The final mile produced its usual fireworks.
        Parkins maintained his hard charge, but was overtaken by one runner
        and finished 12th in a PR 25:16 -- the third best MIT performer
        since this course was standardized
        in 1992. Only Ethan Crain's 24:40 and Jesse Darley's 25:06 in
        the 1994 All-New Englands are faster.
        
        
        
        Strauss overtook McGuire around Bear Cage
        Hill, and stormed to 23rd place in a PR 25:34 (#4 ever for MIT),
        with McGuire 26th in a near-PR 25:40. 
        
        
        
        Big PR's were posted by Loiselle (26:38 in
        55th place), and Husain (26:41 in 57th), to close out MIT's scoring.
        Johnston missed his PR by 3 seconds (26:51 in 61st).   
        
        
        
        
        
        In the Sub-Varsity race, PR's fell like bowling
        pins. Sophomore Ray Molnar led the attack on the time list by
        finishing 17th in 27:50, a PR by over a minute. Also bettering
        previous marks by such a margin were freshmen Aaron Adler (20th,
        27:56) and Ken Walker (24th, 28:10). Senior Chuck Van Buren, sophomore
        Stanley Hu, and freshmen Ed Keehr, Albert Hung, Reid Anderson,
        and Amay Champaneria all posted their all-time best clockings
        as well.  
        
        
        
        
        
        The Engineers' next contest will be on Friday,
        17 October, at Franklin Park in the New England Intercollegiate
        Amateur Athletic Association (NEIAAA) Championships. This race
        features the best competition of the season, with Division 1 and
        Division 2 teams lining up with we Division 3 squads to determine
        where we all stack up in the New England scene. The Engineers
        have historically run well against the elevated competition, as
        indicated by the fact that 17 of our top 25 all-time best performers
        at Franklin Park have run that time in the New Englands (four
        of the remaining eight did so in this Pre-Nationals race).
        
        
        
        The Varsity Race will start at 1:30, with
        the Sub-Varsity squad toeing the line at 2:30.  
        
        
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **MIT Splits vs. Tufts and Bates  
        
        **
        
        
        
        GRAFTON, SEPTEMBER 20, 1997 -- The MIT Men's Cross-Country team
        ran their record to 3-1 by splitting a tri-meet with Tufts and
        Bates on Tufts brand new rural course at the Veterinary School
        in Grafton.
        
        
        
         Tufts won their ground-breaking meet with 31 points, MIT took
        second with 44, and Bates wound up third with 55.
        
        
        
         The meet was a measure of revenge for the Engineers after losing
        to both teams at Bates last fall.  Entering the contest, Tufts
        was ranked 3rd in N.E. Division 3 and 7th nationally, and Bates
        was ranked 4th (24th in the nation), to MIT's 6th.  The Engineers
        effort will surely move them up in the poll, and possibly into
        the national picture as well.
        
        
        
         Team co-captain Mike Parkins '99 led the Engineers with a strong
        second place finish, covering the challenging and hilly 5-mile
        course in 27:11.  The time was far off his best for the distance,
        but the difficulty of the terrain, coupled with the heat and high
        humidity, kept times slower throughout the field.  Chris McGuire
        '00 was the #2 runner in 27:29, placing fifth overall, and Mark
        Strauss '01 ran a solid race to earn 7th (27:53).
        
        
        
         The first portion of the race saw a pack of Tufts runners move
        to the fore -- polar opposite strategy from last year's race --
        with a couple of Bates runners and MIT's top three in the mix.
         
        
        
        
         By the third mile, Bates' Justin Freeman had moved into control
        of the race with Parkins at his side and Tufts' Jason Burke close
        behind.  McGuire had fallen slightly off the pace and headed the
        small second pack.  A few hundred yards behind him, MIT seniors
        Rich Rosalez and Sohail Husain were working their way past some
        fading Tufts and Bates runners, moving the team into contention.
        
        
        
            Freeman made his move before the 4-mile post, and opened a
        gap on Parkins.  Mike's final mile is typically his forte, and
        he matched Freeman stride-for-stride, but could not cut into his
        lead.  McGuire hit four miles in fourth place, but was overtaken
        in the final moments.  Rosalez finished his race strong, his steady
        workman's pace bringing him up to 12th in the 64-man field, and
        essentially clinching the win over Bates.  Husain ran a gutsy
        race, making the effort to break away from a tight pack of four
        Bates runners, but was overtaken by that pack in the final half-mile.
        
        
        
         Interim Head Coach Dick MacKenzie was generally pleased with
        the team's performance.  "The guys have better in them, I
        know, but they gave a good competitive effort against two very
        solid teams today.  We had several guys put up their best race
        of the season -- not timewise, perhaps, but time is less relevant
        in cross-country, especially on a new and unfamiliar course. 
        We had much better competition today, and I think we rose to meet
        it.  We were only six points down to Tufts at four miles, so I
        have to think we should be looking for good things as we move
        down the road."
        
        
        
         Other MIT runners who put up fine performances included Frank
        Johnston '00, the team's sixth man, who closed to within six seconds
        of Husain, and Phil Loiselle '01 who was only another four seconds
        in arrears as number seven.
        
        
        
         "We have a nice intra-team situation going on," said
        MacKenzie.  "Our top three race together well, and Rich is
        solidly our fourth man, but then we have a real mix duking it
        out for the number five, six, and seven spots.  Their scrappiness
        in trying to beat one another will make all of them improve.
        
        
        
         Sophomore Ray Molnar and freshman Ed Keehr both made great strides
        in the race as well, easily recording their best team finishes
        to date.
        
        
        
         MIT hits the road to New York this weekend, taking in the highly
        competitive Cortland Invitational at SUNY-Cortland.  A number
        of the nation's top-25 ranked teams will be in attendance.  Last
        year, the Engineers raced to seventh place in a 25-team field.
        
        
        
         
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **HARRIERS FALTER IN BOWDOIN 5K  
        
        **
        
        
        
        BRUNSWICK, MAINE -- In what has been a generally successful season,
        the MIT Engineers Men's Cross-Country team produced their first
        poor outing in a loss to both Bowdoin and Bates in the 1st Bowdoin
        Invitational last Saturday. The host school used excellent grouping
        to capture the win with 34 points. Their fifth man was a mere
        32 seconds behind their first. Bates captured second, behind the
        first-place finish of rebounding sophomore Matt Twiest. Their
        48 point just edged out MIT's total of 50.
        
        
        
        The setback should have dire effects on MIT's local and national
        rankings, potentially dropping the Beavers from their #6 spot
        in New England, and possibly sliding them off the list from their
        #23 national ranking.
        
        
        
        "We worked hard through this week," offered interim
        head coach Dick MacKenzie, " and I knew that would take some
        of the snap out of their legs. I didn't think it would take quite
        this much, though. There are some meets you train through, and
        some you focus on: this one we trained through. And with two solid
        opponents like this, we ended up taking some lumps."
        
        
        
        Junior co-captain Mike Parkins produced one of the best efforts
        of the day, barely losing to Twiest by four seconds (15:32). Parkins,
        with sophomore teammate Chris McGuire on his shoulder, set an
        aggressive pace with a 4:54 opening mile on the rain-softened
        turf. Twiest made a big move and took the lead just before the
        2-mile post, which they reached in 10:01. Parkins stayed on the
        Bates' runner's back into the final 600-yard straightaway, but
        was unable to find the extra gear to overhaul him.
        
        
        
        McGuire followed in third for most of the race, but was reeled
        in shortly before the line by Bowdoin's Mike Peyton, and had to
        settle for fourth (15:36).
        
        
        
        Senior Sohail Husain also produced a strong race, claiming the
        #3-Man slot for the first time this year, and finishing 12th in
        16:11. Senior co-captain Rich Rosalez was close behind in 15th
        in 16:15, and freshman Mark Strauss closed out the scoring in
        17th with a 16:18 clocking.
        
        
        
        Sophomore Frank Johnston fortified his hold on the #6-Man spot
        by running a smart and patient race, moving up through the field
        to finish 19th in 16:28. Freshmen Liyan Guo (16:32) and Phil Loiselle
        (16:35) followed close behind in 21st and 22nd. Also in the hunt
        for the top seven were sophomore Ray Molnar (26th, 16:43), and
        ever-improving freshman Ken Walker (27th, 16:48).
        
        
        
        For the season thus far, the Engineers have run up an overall
        record of 49-22, including all opponents in all races.  
        
        
        
        
        
        Daylight Savings Time is over, and that means that Championship
        Season is upon us. The Beavers return to Worcester Polytechnic
        Institute -- the scene of their Engineers' Cup triumph six weeks
        ago -- this Saturday to compete in the Constitution Athletic Conference
        Championship Meet. Prime opposition is expected to come from the
        U.S. Coast Guard Academy, whose team has looked solid each week.
        
        
        
        
        Also in the Conference are: Babson, Clark, Norwich, Springfield,
        Western New England, and the host school WPI.
        
        
        
        MIT won this meet last year with 30 points, outscoring both Coast
        Guard and Springfield, who tied for second with 55. Arnold Seto
        won the race to earn Runner of the Year honors, with Chris McGuire
        garnering Rookie of the Year laurels.
        
        
        
        In 1995, the meet was a barn-burner, with MIT prevailing over
        Coast Guard by a solitary point, 39-40. Ethan Crain's took the
        individual win in the slick mud, but it was then-freshman Mike
        Parkins' 1-second edge of Coast Guard's 3rd man, that was the
        difference.
        
        
        
        Since CAC was formed in 1990, MIT has claimed the Team Title all
        but once (3rd, in 1990), and Coast Guard has been second all but
        once (1st, in 1990). 
        
        
        
        The race is at Institute Park, adjacent to the WPI campus, and
        the gun fires at 11:00.

        Honors**

        This past Saturday, the MIT men's cross country team returned
        to Institute Park at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with hopes
        of winning the Constitution Athletic Conference title for a sixth
        consecutive year. Earlier this year, MIT cruised to victory at
        Institute park and this race was a sure way to measure the team's
        progress as it prepares for National Qualifiers.  
        
        
        
        
        
        The harriers were well aware that to win the conference title
        for the seventh time in eight years the team would have to out
        race an impressive squad from the United States Coast Guard Academy.
        When the gun sounded, and over one hundred runners thundered down
        the first straight away, it was immediately apparent that Coast
        Guard had planned on taking the title away from the Engineers.
        Coast Guard started the race extremely fast, with their top runner
        leading the race, and with enough in the front pack to steal a
        win.  
        
        
        
        
        
        Aware that the team's title hopes were in trouble, co-captain
        Mike Parkins '99 and Chris McGuire '00 responded, intelligently
        waiting to make a move on the lead runner. Parkins and McGuire
        had let the Coast Guard runner take a 50 meter lead before they
        reeled him in and watched him suffer in a pointless attempt to
        keep up. MIT's dynamic duo outperformed the competition once again,
        as Parkins earned Runner of the Year Honors, winning in a course
        record 25:40. McGuire also finished under the old course record
        time and was awarded All-Conference Honors as he claimed second
        place in 25:43 to finish off MIT's lethal one-two combo.  
        
        
        
        
        
        As Coast Guard runners followed by placing 3rd. 4th, and 5th,
        the team title was still up for grabs. Co-captain Rich Rosalez
        '98 battled several lead runners from other conference schools
        and steadily moved his way up from 15th place at the first mile
        to a 7th place finish in 26:37. Rosalez also earned All-Conference
        honors for finishing in the top ten, and like McGuire and Parkins,
        he took over a minute off his time from the race at Institute
        Park earlier in the season.  Coast Guard's depth was too much
        for the Engineers after that point, as the Bears captured 8th
        and 9th to seal the victory. Mark Strauss was not far behind,
        taking eleventh place in 26:49 on the wet and winding five mile
        course. Sohail Husain improved tremendously to finish in 12th
        place in 27:08, guaranteeing MIT a second place finish. Phil Loiselle
        '01 and Liyan Guo '01 rounded out the Engineers top seven, finishing
        in 15th and 17th place respectively.  
        
        
        
        
        
        Several other runners had noteable performances. Ray Molnar '00
        and Frank Johnston '00 ran together and stayed close to the varisty
        runners as they finished 19th and 20th. A pack of freshmen, who
        worked together throuhgout the race, finished next, as Jeff Billing
        '01, Ken Walker '01, and Aaron Adler '01, placed 23rd, 24th, and
        26th. Ryan Peoples '00 also finished. In the last cross country
        race of his career, Chuck Van Buren '98 finished 40th, improving
        over a minute throughout the season.   
        
        
        
        
        
        Ed Keehr '01 finished next for MIT, in 50th, and Gus Blomquist
        '99 narrowly edged Dave Kelman '99 to follow. Stanley Hu '00,
        Reid Anderson '01, and Amay Champaneria '01 continued to improve,
        as Anderson and Champaneria both finished the season with their
        best performance thus far. Albert Hung '01, Kaoru Aou '00, and
        Gerardo Martinez '99 also ran strong. Rob Cox '01 and Ashley Claybourne
        '99 round out the harrier's impressive roster, ranked as high
        as 16th in the nation this season.  
        
        
        
        
        
        Coast Guard finished ahead of MIT on the day by a score of 29
        to 35, as both schools finished well ahead of third place Springfield's
        78 points.  After the race, Parkins had this to say, "I'm
        deeeply honored to be Runner of the Year. I'm really happy with
        the way I've been improving, but I'm mad at coach for cutting
        my playing time each meet."   
        
        
        
        
        
        Rosalez added, "We've got our work cut out for us at National
        Qualifiers.  We are in an unfamiliar position right now, in that
        we are not expected to make National Championships because the
        competitionin New England is so intense this year. This team has
        tremendous potential and if we run like we are capable of, we'll
        make Nationals. I'm confident of that."  
        
        
        
        
        
        The MIT harriers have compiled a record of 53-23 while defeating
        numerous Division I schools and nationally ranked Division III
        schools.  Next Saturday, the Engineers will travel to the University
        of Southern Maine for New England Division III Championships.
        The team hopes to earn a birth for National Championships and
        Parkins and McGuire expect to qualify individually.
