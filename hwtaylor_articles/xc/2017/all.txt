    Varsity Outduels Alumni in Annual Meet                  
    
    
                      
    
    September 2, 2017
    
    
                      
    
    On a sunny, 70 degree day, both the women's and men's varsity cross country teams defeated the "Has-Beens" in the annual Alumni/ae Meet held at Franklin Park, although both alumni teams showed significant improvement over recent years.  The women alums had nine racing while the men had 14 competing runners.  The varsity women placed 1-2-3-5-7, led by Marissa McPhillips '20, tying for the 11th fastest time ever at Franklin Park by an MIT runner with her 18:30 performance.  The final score was varsity 18, alumni 41.  The men were led by Dennis Maloney '19 who was edged at the line by Matt Deyo '16, both timed in 15:31.  The varsity placed 2-3-4-5-6 for 20 points to 43 for the alums.
    
    
                      
    
    The women's race started out fast as Katie Bacher '20 attempted to dominate the race from the front.  Her 5:45 first mile was quick for this time of year, but McPhillips, Mary Eccles '17 and Jenna Melanson '20 were right with her as was Christina Wicker '17 representing the alumnae.  Supporting chase runners, Katie Collins '21 and Lindsey McAllister '21 came through in 5:50 and 5:51 respectively.
    
    
                      
    
    By the second mile mark Bacher had a nice six second lead over McPhillips after a 6:00 clocking on the hilly mile as the group broke up.  Wicker moved past Melanson as she slowed to a 6:17.  Brooke Johnson '13 had moved past McAllister and Louise van den Heuvel '14 was on McAllister's heels.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final 1.1 mile Bacher seemed to let her thoughts of being caught get the best of her as McPhillips moved past her in the final 300 meters.  Bacher ran 18:33 for a big personal best at Franklin Park and second place overall.  Eccles ran a course PR of 18:37 for third place.  Wicker placed fourth in 18:57.  Melanson was fifth overall in 19:05. Johnson was sixth in 19:08 and Collins closed out the scoring with her 19:19.  
    
    
                      
    
    The varsity women were missing a couple of their top runners who should both be competing in their next meet.  This should close the :49 gap one through five.
    
    
                      
    
    Closing out the scoring for the alumnae were van den Heuvel in ninth in 19:26, Alina Gatowski '11, placing 10th in 19:52, and Alexandra Taylor '14 placing 15th in 20:41. Other alums racing were Elaine McVay '15, Claire O'Connell '14, Maggie Lloyd '12 and Stephanie Marzen '15.
    
    
                      
    
    The men's pace was also quite fast as Maloney pushed the pace, leading the first mile in 4:53.  In addition to Deyo trailing right behind were Aidan Gilson '19, Billy Woltz '20 and Kent Slaney '21.  The chase group was spread out over a four second gap, but were quite close (4:55-4:59).  Included in the group were Ben Freed '18, Nate Foss '20, Josh Rosenkranz '19, Dylan Doblar '21, David Walter '18, Noah Zamzow-Schmidt '21, Nicholas Waltman '18 and Jake Jorgensen '21.
    
    
                      
    
    Maloney pushed the second mile, delivering a 5:07 to open up a four second lead on Deyo.  The rest of the group also broke up as Woltz ran an aggressive mile, but Gilson and Slaney slowed too much. Rosenkranz and Foss moved past Freed and looked ready to keep on moving through the field.
    
    
                      
    
    Deyo took the lead coming out of the Wilderness Loop and with a tenth to go had a 10 meter lead.  Maloney closed the gap, taking the lead in the final straight.  However, in the final 20 meters Deyo took the lead for good.  After Maloney, Gilson placed third, putting together a strong third mile to run 15:53.  Woltz closed strong to finish right behind in 15:55.  Foss and Rosenkranz did indeed keep moving, running 5:10 for the final mile to place fourth and fifth on the team in 15:56 and 15:57 respectively.
    
    
                      
    
    The varsity men displayed a 36 second delta through seven runners, although the distance was only a 5K.  Many top runners were held out for various reasons.  Their return should provide the quality and depth to keep the seventh ranked team in the country for Division III towards the top of the best teams.
    
    
                      
    
    Scoring for the alumni were Justin Bullock '14, placing 12th in 16:32, Colin Godwin '17, placing 13th in 16:35, Roy Wedge '14, placing 15th in 16:59 and Allen Leung '15, placing 19th in 17:32.  Others who ran were Logan Trimble '13, Jared Forman '13, Eric Khatchadourian '06, Joe Roy-Mayhew '08, Terry McNatt '87, Bob Collins '82, Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11 and Peter Mulligan '08. Supporting alums were Ethan Crain '96, Tom Hansen '74 and Sarah Quinn '17.
    
    
                      
    
    The varsity got the job done but need to work on their race focus, spread of runners one through five and eliminating the mental obstacles prior to their first intercollegiate race, the Purple Valley Classic on September 23 hosted by Williams College.

    Cross Country Ends Season With Disappointing Performance
    
    
                      
    
    November 18, 2017
    
    
                      
    
    Today, MIT's Men's and Women's Cross Country teams competed in the NCAA Division III Championship, hosted by Principia College in Elsah, Illinois.  Both teams were ranked high and expecting to do well after both won, what is considered to be one of the two best regions in the country, last week.  Of all the things that went well last week, those same things blew up this week in the biggest race of the season.  The men, seeded seventh, and firmly believing they could finish among the top four teams if they repeated their effort from the week before, only had their top two perform well, finishing 16th out of 32 teams.  The women, a solid second place seed had three solid performances, which was not enough, finishing fourth, 19 points out of second place.
    
    
                      
    
    The temperature at the course dropped 25 degrees from the time warmups started for the men to the time the women started their warmup after the men's race, a drop from 64 degrees to 39 degrees. This was accompanied by thirty to forty mile per hour gusts and some light rain.  The adversity was what MIT was hoping for, but they did not seem to handle it well.  The men, who raced first, looked as though they got out on the uphill start into the wind pretty well.  However, by the mile mark, only Dennis Maloney '19 was in an ideal position of 11th place in 4:57 on the uphill mile, which had a rise of 100'.  Josh Rosenkranz '19 was out reasonably well along with Aidan Gilson '19, in 94th and 95th place in 5:07.  Based on the team's usual spread, both should have been about :05 closer to Maloney, which would have put them in the top 50--a much better position.  From here it got much worse.  The rest of the team (Alex Knoedler '18, Brian Bates '20, Billy Woltz '20 and Nicholas Waltman '18) came through between 5:10 and 5:13, which had them between 147th and 200th place, much too far to come back from.  Woltz had come through in a big way last week, but this start was more like how he had raced prior to that.
    
    
                      
    
    Nevertheless, they were in eighth place at the two mile mark as Maloney moved to third, Rosenkranz to 71st and Gilson to 73rd.  Of the other four, only Knoedler moved up in the second mile, going from 147th to 140th on the downhill mile.  It seemed the determination the team showed last week, evaporated when they were caught in the sea of humanity and probably started to lose hope when they were unable to move up as expected.
    
    
                      
    
    Maloney stayed in position during the third and fourth miles and Rosenkranz continued to move up, reaching 34th place at mile four.  Knoedler was inching up, making it up to 117th by the start of the final mile.  However, Gilson lost 44 places as he raced similar to how he did on the same course in the Pre National race in October.  Bates, Woltz and Waltman also lost places, all sitting between 212th and 231st.  During this time the team overall had fallen back to 13th place.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final mile both Maloney, Rosenkranz and Knoedler lost their forward momentum.  Maloney earned his second straight All America award by placing 19th in 24:43.  Rosenkranz placed 47th, seven places out of All America in 25:04.  Knoedler was 154th in 25:47, his largest delta of the season.  Gilson ran about what he had most of the season with the exception of last week where he ran more to his potential.  This week he was 157th in 25:47.  Bates closed out the scoring, finishing 196th in 26:04.  The total delta was 1:21 delta for one through five was the worst of the season.
    
    
                      
    
    The women did not seem as relaxed as they should have and certainly did not seem excited to go after pre-race favorite Johns Hopkins.  Instead they seemed tight and anxious.  The attitude that had been there the entire season seemed to be missing, or at least second guessed.  Nevertheless, having placed among the top six teams in the country every year since 2009, the women knew what they were doing.  They knew they needed to get out better than in the past, getting closer to Johns Hopkins and then moving to catch them in the final two miles.  
    
    
                      
    
    Hopkins did what they do best, getting out pretty well.  They had six runners in the top 39 with the first MIT runner being Marissa McPhillips '20 in 47th in 5:52 for the uphill mile.  Worse, only Katie Bacher '20 was close to McPhillips in 49th place.  Leandra Zimmermann '19 was in 82nd place.  Megan McCandless '20 was 102nd and Mary Eccles '18 was 115th.  Emily Niu '21 was back at 159th and Katie Collins '21, MIT's top runner here at pre-nationals, was having confidence problems back in 238th.
    
    
                      
    
    McPhillips, Zimmermann, Eccles and McCandless ran an excellent second mile, moving up to 30th 33rd, 64th and 73rd respectively.  Bacher, feeling she had nothing in her legs, fell back to 60th.  Nevertheless the team was in a solid second place at this point with 161 points to 99 for Johns Hopkins.  In the team scoring, subtracting individuals not with teams, MIT was in 17, 20, 37, 40 and 47 while Hopkins was 2, 14, 18, 30 and 35.  MIT was headed in the right direction if they could keep moving up and Bacher could fix her backslide.
    
    
                      
    
    McPhillips, Eccles and McCandless did indeed move up more, but Zimmermann lost six places and Bacher 50.  Regardless, MIT was still in second.  Hopkins now had 108 points and MIT 190.  However, Wisconsin Eau Claire was closing hard at 212 points and the University of Washington, St. Louis was moving up with 238 points
    
    
                      
    
    In the final .73 of the 6K course, McPhillips again had a problem staying on her feet, as has also happened in three other races this fall, losing 41 places as she fell at least once, barely making it to the finish before collapsing in 69th place.  Zimmermann moved back up to 30th to claim her first All America honor.  Eccles moved up to 53rd and McCandless to 58th, her best race of the season.  Bacher maintained her position in 111th place.  Unfortunately, both UW Eau Claire and Wash U passed MIT, but Tech still maintained a podium position in fourth place.
    
    
                      
    
    All MIT athletes performed at their best on this day.  Their mental weaknesses were exposed, which meant their best was no where near their potential.  Coach Halston Taylor, thinking he had his teams prepared, obviously failed to get them ready to race their best.
    
    
                      
    
    The men and women both graduate only one of their top five.  There are quite a few runners waiting to step up next year.  Perhaps next year they can run without fear.

    MIT Outperforms Competition at NEICAAA Championship
    
    
                      
    
    October 7, 2017
    
    
                      
    
    In the summer that would never end, MIT competed in the NEICAAA Championship at Franklin Park in Boston amid mid-80 degree temperatures under sunny and humid conditions.  Fortunately this effects everyone and the MIT runners feel confident when facing adversity.  Both the men's and women's teams did very well, the women placing third overall despite not running their top runner from their first race, Katie Bacher, defeating all Division II and III teams, losing only to the University of New Hampshire and Boston College.  The men, running intact, placed second despite not having the best race from three of their top runners, losing by a mere five points.
    
    
                      
    
    The NEICAAA Championship is made up of all Division I, II and III teams in New England. Some teams choose not to attend in favor of large invitationals the previous week or the week after.  However, for the most part it is still a very competitive meet.  The men's race had 27 teams while the women's had 28 teams compete.
    
    
                      
    
    Since the varsity races only permit seven runners each, sub-varsity races allowed teams to put their remaining runners in a race, which this early in the season is necessary in determining who the ultimate top seven will be at the end of the season.  The women's sub-varsity race was first.  Tessa Weiss '20, led the way for MIT, placing 11th in the race in 19:31.  Weiss went out a bit too fast for the weather conditions, particularly the first half mile. By the mile mark she was already fatigued.  Given the start of the race, Weiss competed well, coming back in the third mile.  Emily Niu '21, racing for the first time, raced well, finishing 19th in 19:39.  Her lack of training due to a previous injury showed in the final mile.  Margaret Trautner '20 had a breakout race, placing 25th in 19:49.  Overall the sub-varsity women finished fifth with 138 points.
    
    
                      
    
    The men's sub-varsity team had an outstanding performance, finishing second, just six points behind the winning team, UMass Lowell, a Division I team.  Alex Knoedler '18, returning from injury, is still at relatively low mileage, but showed his competitiveness by going with the leaders right from the start.  Knoedler and David Walter '18 stayed among the top runners for much of the race.  Knoedler finished in sixth in 26:30 and Walter in seventh in 26:33.  Both went out a little fast for the conditions.  Even though they paid for it, they continued to race with focus and determination.  
    
    
                      
    
    In the women's varsity race, the pace was quick given the temperature.  The leaders came through the mile in 5:22.  Mary Eccles '18 led the Engineers with a 5:39 first mile, which put her in 43rd place.  Marissa McPhillips '20 and Megan McCandless '20 were right behind her and Leandra Zimmermann '19 led teammates Katie Collins '21, Jenna Melanson '20, and Lindsey McAllister '21 at 5:43, which put them between 60th and 70th place.  By the two mile, Zimmermann had moved into 10th place in 11:39, which included  Bear Cage Hill at about the 1 1/2 point.  Eccles moved up to 23rd and McPhillips up to 25th place.  Collins was up to 33rd position, with McCandless at 45th, running in trainers to protect her foot, and Melanson in 49th.  McAllister was back in 71st place after suffering through a 6:26 mile.  The third mile saw Zimmermann lose a few places, finishing in 13th in a personal best 18:34.  McPhillips moved up to 18th in 18:30 while Eccles held her 23rd place in 18:37.  Collins ran an excellent race for a freshman, placing 24th in 18:39.  McCandless, not really race ready, faded to 53rd in 19:08 and Melanson was 55th in 19:11.  McAllister finished in 68th in 19:21.
    
    
                      
    
    The men were determined to go after this race and got carried away a little with a start that was a bit faster than necessary.  By the mile mark they were slowing down instead of speeding up or maintaining.  Dennis Maloney '19 was in 29th place at 4:49.  Josh Rosenkranz '19, Aidan Gilson '19, Billy Woltz '20 and Kent Slaney '21 were between 49th-53rd in 4:52.  Nate Foss '20 was 58th in 4:53 and Nicholas Waltman '18 was 84th in 4:58.  By the end of the second mile Maloney was in third, about twenty meters from the two leaders in 9:56.  Gilson, Rosenkranz and Slaney were closing in towards the front of the chase pack in 28th 29th and 30th in 10:10.  Woltz was back in 55th and Foss in 60th in 10:17, convincing themselves they could make it up later, which was not likely to happen in that heat.  Maloney was still in third at mile three, but was now about thirty meters out of second and first was no where in sight.  Gilson moved up to 12th and Rosenkranz was in 16th close behind.  Woltz had made a move to 38th place, but Slaney had slipped to 45th as he had been heel striking for the past two miles.  Foss was still in 60th, but looking pretty comfortable.  The trends continued for the final two miles.  The chase group caught up with Maloney in the final mile, but he held on for sixth place overall in 25:30.  Rosenkranz moved up to 14th in 25:40 and Gilson slipped to 17th in 25:42, a huge PR for the junior.  Woltz continued to move up, placing 34th in 26:05 and Foss woke up a little to finish in 26:26 in 53rd place.  Losing the meet by just five points knowing they did not race their best had to be frustrating to the Engineers.  Nevertheless they should be pleased with their best finish in this race in over 60 years.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, the top 10 men and women will represent MIT at the Cowbell Classic, the Pre-National race for Division III at Principia College in Alton, IL.  Many of the top teams in the country will be there including the top three in the women's race and the top two in the men's race.

    MIT Harriers Defend NCAA Division III New England Region Titles
    
    
                      
    
    November 11, 2017
    
    
                      
    
    MIT traveled to Gorham Country Club this weekend, home of the NCAA Division III New England Region Cross Country Championship hosted by the University of Southern Maine.  The course was soft and even torn up a bit in some areas, but also frozen solid in other areas due to the below freezing temperatures the day before and day of the meet.  The men from MIT were seeded second in the region and 10th in the country for Division III while the women were seeded first in the region and second in the country.
    
    
                      
    
    The men raced first on the hilly course.  The plan was simple, be somewhat cautious in the first mile, move up in the second mile and put themselves in position to race number one seed Amherst College man to man.  
    
    
                      
    
    At the mile mark, MIT runners looked strong.  Dennis Maloney '19, the top returning runner, having finished fourth in 2016, was among the lead pack in a relatively slow 5:05, and quite surprisingly, Josh Rosenkranz '19 and Aidan Gilson '19 were right with him, all three in the top 15.  Billy Woltz '20, Alex Knoedler '18 and Brian Bates '20 were also together at 5:11, probably around 60-70th place.  Nicholas Waltman '18 took himself out of the race pretty early with a 5:16 first mile.
    
    
                      
    
    During the second mile Maloney gained three seconds on Gilson and Rosenkranz as he tried to push the pace.  Knoedler, Woltz and Bates were still together but Bates was looking as though he was not committed enough to stay with his teammates but instead starting to give-in to his doubts.
    
    
                      
    
    In the third mile, Maloney gained a little more on his teammates, but the spread one through five was still only 13 seconds.  Some of this was due to a relatively slow pace by the leaders, but most of it was due to a tremendous improvement by Gilson and Woltz.  Maloney, Rosenkranz and Knoedler had been very consistent most of the season.  Tech knew that both Gilson and Woltz should be among the top five, and if they would make that leap, the team would be one of the best in the country and could win the region.
    
    
                      
    
    During mile four Maloney went for the win, pulling away from the main pack.  He opened up an additional 15 seconds on his teammates.  But in the final mile he did not continue to push, giving up the lead and ultimately losing by :09 for third place in 25:31.  Amherst's first runner was fifth with their second runner in eighth.  Gilson was MIT's second man in 12th at 25:45, making up a lot of ground in the final mile.  Rosenkranz was 16th in 25:51, two spots ahead of Amherst's third man.  Amherst also put their fourth ahead of MIT's fourth, Woltz in 26:00 in 22nd place.  MIT was at 53 points to 52 for Amherst through four runners.  Knoedler finished in 28th in 26:07 to Amherst's fifth in 39th to take the team title with 81 points to 91 for Amherst in the 55 team field.
    
    
                      
    
    The women's race plan was to also go out somewhat conservatively, but close on the chase pack during mile two, who would likely be chasing outstanding freshman, Kaitlyn Mooney of the Coast Guard Academy.  With the top five being interchangeable thus far in the season, it was thought that Katie Bacher '20, Katie Collins '21, Mary Eccles '18, Marissa McPhillips '20 and Leandra Zimmermann '19 would be together and all within the top 10-15 runners.  Megan McCandless '20 also has been returning to the skills of her freshman year bit by bit and would likely be with them.
    
    
                      
    
    However, things did not quite go as planned.  Collins did not get out well and McCandless, wearing transition glasses, had difficulty seeing in the shady areas, unsure of her footing.  By the mile mark, the foursome of Bacher, Eccles, McPhillips and Zimmermann were in the top 15 at 5:44 and looking pretty strong, although already about five seconds back.  Collins, having been swallowed up by the field when she was unable to get out, was 10 seconds back and McCandless was another six seconds behind.  Tessa Weiss '20 took herself out of the race mentally by the mile mark, coming through in 6:16.
    
    
                      
    
    In mile two, nothing much changed, but the leaders continued to put seconds between themselves and the lead MIT runners.  Collins and McCandless stabilized, all six running between 5:42 and 5:48.  
    
    
                      
    
    Mile three was a different story.  Bacher, tending to suffer from asthma, was struggling with the cold weather and Collins fell off a bit.  At the three mile mark, McPhillips came through in 17:13 and Collins, the sixth MIT runner was clocked in 17:48 on the very hilly course, so a pretty solid delta on a hilly and challenging course.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final .73, McPhillips held on well, finishing in seventh in 21:04 and Zimmermann was eighth in 21:12.  Eccles was two back in 10th in 21:14.  Bacher lost a lot of time, but not a lot of places, earning 16th in 21:39.  McCandless placed 17th n 21:40 to close out the scoring.  Collins had an outstanding finish, placing 22nd in 21:47.  MIT won easily with 58 points in the 56 team field.  Tufts University upset Williams College for second with 92 to the Ephs 106.
    
    
                      
    
    One of the advantages for both the men and women at MIT was the fans who drove up from Cambridge to support their teammates.  About 30 or so of the men's and women's track & field and cross country team members took the initiative to rent cars and drive up to the meet.  Those who were racing, felt the constant cheers, seemingly everywhere on the course, made the difference whenever they felt fatigue or doubt.
    
    
                      
    
    Both the men and women earned automatic bids to the NCAA Division III Championship at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois next Saturday.  Both teams have some mental work to do if they hope to accomplish the goals they have been pointing to all season.

    MIT Extends NEWMAC Championship Win Streak
    
    
                      
    
    October 29, 2017
    
    
                      
    
    The MIT Men's and Women's Cross Country teams were looking forward to attempting to extend their NEWMAC Conference Cross Country Championship winning streak today, which stands at 19 for the men and 10 for the women.  From an individual standpoint the team members were also looking forward to racing in temperatures below 85 degrees for the first time this year.  
    
    
                      
    
    The championship was hosted by Emerson College at historic Franklin Park.  Although the temperatures were in the upper 60's, the humidity was very high and the ground was soft from rain.  Not ideal conditions, but much better than the Engineers have experienced thus far this year.
    
    
                      
    
    The nationally 10th ranked men raced first and the plan was to go out somewhat aggressively while respecting that the soft course would not be returning much energy to the runners.  At the mile mark Dennis Maloney '19 was in the lead, comfortably pacing a 4:50 first mile.  Following three second back were five MIT runners; Josh Rosenkranz '19, Aidan Gilson '19, Billy Woltz '20, Nate Foss '20 and Kent Slaney '21, two from Babson; Matthew Dynan '19 and Josh Decker '18, and two from WPI; Michael Brady '19 and Avery Ingegneri '20.  Overall the MIT team was pretty close with a total spread of 15 seconds at that point for the 17 runners.
    
    
                      
    
    Things spread out quite a bit with the hilly second mile and Maloney pushing the pace.  Maloney hit the two mile in 9:58 and had a six second lead over Dynan of Babson, but the next seven runners were from MIT within 12 seconds of one another.  Alex Knoedler '18, Nicholas Waltman '18, Brian Bates '20, Alex Knapp '19 and David Walter '18, all from MIT, were moving up from a more conservative start.
    
    
                      
    
    At the end of three miles, Rosenkranz had passed Dynan and was only 11 second behind Maloney.  Dynan looked to be hurting a bit and Waltman, Knoedler, Woltz and Gilson were closing the gap.  At the end of four, both Knoedler and Waltman passed the Babson runner and Knapp, Gilson and Woltz were looking strong. Then behind Ingegneri, Decker and Jack Pinho '19 from Springfield, Bates from MIT was about to unleash his famous finish.  At this point Bates was in 12th place.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final mile Maloney pushed it to widen the gap significantly, winning in 25:03.  Rosenkranz faded a bit but claimed second in 25:32 with Knoedler in third in 25:48.  Dynan outkicked Waltman to take fourth and then was followed by Pinho from Springfield, three second ahead of Bates in sixth.  MIT closed out the scoring with Gilson right with Bates (possibly ahead of) and Knapp and Woltz right on their heels. MIT's 18 points won by a substantial amount over the eight team field with WPI claiming second with 71 points.  MIT's men's team has never lost the championship in the 20 year history of the conference.
    
    
                      
    
    Maloney earned Runner of the Year honors and Jake Oeding of MIT took NEWMAC Rookie honors.
    
    
                      
    
    The Women's race would be the final 5K of the season, although the course is actually slightly longer than 5K.  The pre-race favorite was freshman Kaitlyn Mooney from Coast Guard.  The rookie has only lost to superstar Taryn  Cordani '18 of Ithaca College, as she has torched all of New England.  The MIT group of Mary Eccles '18, Katie Collins '21, Leandra Zimmermann '19, Katie Bacher '20 and Marissa McPhillips '20 were planning on doing their best to stay with Mooney.
    
    
                      
    
    At the mile mark it looked as though the plan might work pretty well.  The Coast Guard freshman was in the lead at 5:32, which was impressive for how soft the ground was on this day.  MIT's pace was two to three seconds back, looking comfortable.  Behind them it was another six seconds to Jenna Melanson '20 of MIT, who was just ahead of Sydney Packard '20 of WPI.  They were followed by MIT's Megan McCandless '20 and Tessa Weiss '20 in 5:44.
    
    
                      
    
    The plan for the Engineers, ranked second in the country, was to catch up to Mooney at the end of the second mile, but that was not to be.  Mooney had 10 seconds on Eccles at the two mile mark, coming through in 11:18.  Eccles, Collins, Zimmermann, Bacher and McPhillips were all within four seconds of each other.  Packard of WPI was well back of the quintet but had pulled ahead of McCandless by a bit. Melanson had fallen back a lot and Gabrielle Enns '21 of MIT joined the fray, passing Weiss.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final 1.1 miles, Eccles finished well, running 18:09, 17 seconds behind Mooney.  Collins closed well, finishing two seconds behind Eccles with Zimmermann being less than a second behind Collins.  Bacher, suffering from a cold, lost a lot in the final mile, finishing in 18:31.  McPhillips, with her teammates with a quarter mile to go, collapsed briefly before getting up and finishing, struggling to get to the line in 18:32.  The 23 second spread is impressive but can be even better as each of the five runners have been the lead MIT finisher in a race this year.  The parts are interchangeable, depending on the day.  McCandless finished well, 20 seconds back with Weiss 10 more seconds back to finish 9th.
    
    
                      
    
    Tech claimed the victory with 20 points, 42 better than second place WPI.  This earned the women their 11th consecutive conference title.  Mooney of Coast Guard claimed the Runner of the Year as well as the Rookie of the Year.
    
    
                      
    
    In two weeks, MIT will race in the NCAA Division III New England Region Championship, hosted by Southern Maine, to determine if they will get to run at the NCAA Division III Championship on November 18th in Elsah, Illinois at Principia College.  The top two teams earn automatic selection with the possibility of others being selected on an at-large basis.

    Engineers Meet Expectations at Pre-Nationals, Men Sixth, Women Second
    
    
                      
    
    October 14, 2017
    
    
                      
    
    With the opportunity to be in a loaded national field at the Pre-National Cowbell Classic, MIT traveled to Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, the site of the 2017 NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship, to get a feel for the course and to test the somewhat arbitrary national rankings in order to get a sense of just how well they would perform against the country's best Division III teams. 
    
    
                      
    
    In a continuation of extreme summer conditions in what is supposed to be the fourth week of the Fall, the race time temperature was 90 degrees, sunny and moderately humid.  The men raced first, finishing sixth in a field of 38 teams.  The top two teams, North Central College and SUNY Geneseo were also the top two teams in the national ranking.  Third was fifth ranked Pomona Pitzer, fourth was 11th ranked Loras, and fifth was eighth ranked Wash. U of St Louis.  MIT, ranked 12th, finished ahead of ninth ranked Christopher Newport and 10th ranked Calvin.  Other nationally ranked teams in the race and their finish were 17th ranked Johns Hopkins finishing eighth, 15th ranked Wartburg finishing 10th, 13th ranked UW Eau Claire finishing 11th, 24th ranked Ohio Northern finishing 12th, 20th ranked Occidental finishing 13th, 19th ranked UW Stout finished 14th, unranked Chicago finished 15th, 27th ranked UW Platteville finished 16th, 30th ranked Emory University finished 17th, and 31st ranked Albion finished 18th.
    
    
                      
    
    At the mile mark, it was clear that MIT was being conservative on the very hilly course.  Dennis Maloney '19 was with the leaders in eighth place in 5:04, but the next MIT runner was Billy Woltz '20 in 56th position in 5:10 with Josh Rosenkranz '19, Kent Slaney '21, Alex Knoedler '18, and Aidan Gilson '19 at 5:12.  Behind them were teammates Nate Foss (5:15), David Walter (5:16), Nicholas Waltman (5:17) and Jake Oeding (5:22).  
    
    
                      
    
    By the three mile mark, Maloney was still with the leaders at 15:09, but Rosenkranz had moved up to 20th in 15:22,  Knoedler to 50th in 15:36, Gilson up to 61st in 15:40,  and Woltz slipping a bit to 75th in 15:46.  Waltman, clearly having a conservative first mile, had moved up to 90th and was the sixth runner for MIT at this point in 15:49.  
    
    
                      
    
    In the fourth mile the trend stayed the same with Gilson sliding back and Waltman moving up, but others held their position well.  In the final mile, which was a relatively downhill mile, Maloney, finishing sixth overall, lost 27 seconds to the winner, Isaac Garcia-Cassani of SUNY Geneseo who won in 24:41 despite a 4:51 by Maloney, who finished in 25:08.  Rosenkranz held onto 20th in 25:35, Knoedler finished in 55th in 26:08, Woltz was 66th in 26:16 and Waltman successfully moved up to fifth on the team and 76th overall in 26:22.  Gilson allowed the beginnings of a cold to get to him, finishing in 90th in 26:33.  Foss was 106th in 26:41, Walter 118th in 26:47, Oeding 135th in 27:00 and Slaney was 211th in 27:57.
    
    
                      
    
    The 1:00 spread for 1-3 is pretty dismal for a team hoping to get to the point of finishing on the podium at Nationals.  While they are a young team, with six of the top seven unaccustomed to running varsity and meets of this caliber, they had better toughen up a bit if they hope to accomplish their goal.
    
    
                      
    
    The women's race featured an equal if not better slice of the top teams in the country.  Johns Hopkins ranked number one in the country followed by Wash U at #2, MIT at #3, SUNY Geneseo at #4, Chicago at #6, CMS at #7, UW Eau Claire at 10th, Hope at #12, Calvin at #15, St Olaf at #18, Emory at #21, Wheaton (IL) at #22, Wartburg at #25, Ithaca at #29, Trinity (TX) at #31, UW Stevens Point at #32,  and Occidental at #34.  Although likely much hotter than five weeks from now, this race could very well be a preview of the top four teams in the country.
    
    
                      
    
    In typical fashion, Taryn Cordani '18 of Ithaca took off at the gun, ignoring the competition as if the race was just a time trial.  By the mile mark the race for first place was over.  Also in typical fashion, Johns Hopkins went out extremely hard, dominating the team race in the first mile, running in fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth and 10th.  Meanwhile, MIT, going out aggressively relative to their normal race practices were led by Jenna Melanson '20 in 12th at 5:54 with Mary Eccles '18 in 14th, also in 5:54.  Leandra Zimmermann '19 was in 18th in 5:55, along with Katie Bacher '20, also in 5:55 in 19th place. Marissa McPhillips '20 and Katie Collins '21 were at 5:56 in 23rd and 24th place.  It was clearly becoming a dual meet, but one which Johns Hopkins was clearly winning.
    
    
                      
    
    By the end of the second mile it was clear that MIT was moving up, but not significantly enough to guarantee they would succeed in catching Johns Hopkins. Melanson had begun to fall back as her second mile was a 6:03.  Bacher had moved up significantly to lead the Engineers after running a 5:35 mostly downhill mile.  Close behind were Collins who had run a 5:41 mile along with Zimmermann, McPhillips and Eccles.  At this point Johns Hopkins was in fifth, sixth, and seventh.  Bacher was passing their fourth runner, moving from 10th to ninth.  They were also occupying 13th while MIT had 14th, 15th, 16th and 19th.
    
    
                      
    
    In the third mile MIT continued to move up with Bacher claiming seventh and Collins sliding up to eighth.  McPhillips was in 14th, Eccles in 17th and Zimmermann losing some ground to 21st.  At the front things were spreading out a lot.  Hopkins still occupied fourth, fifth and sixth, ninth and 14th, but they were no longer together and MIT was closing on them.  
    
    
                      
    
    In the final .73 the heat got to a few of the runners, significantly affecting one Johns Hopkins runner who was one of their top three, but was unable to finish while just meters from the finish, as well as McPhillips who collapsed with a half mile to go, and barely crossed the finish before collapsing again, losing 14 places.  While Cordani won the 6K in am impressive 20:45, the team battle was a matter of two points in favor or Johns Hopkins.  Ellie Clawson '19 was third in 21:36, and Tasha Freed '19 was sixth in 21:42, both for JHU.  Collins, the top freshman in the field was seventh in 21:43, and Bacher eighth in 21:44.   Therese Olshanski '21 was ninth in 21:49 and Caroline Smith was 11th for JHU in 21:51.  Zimmermann was 15th in 21:58, Eccles 18th in 22:04, and McPhillips 28th in 22:40.  Megan McCandless '20, still coming back from injury was 32nd for MIT in 22:49 and Melanson 45th in 23:05, one place in front of the fifth JHU runner also in 23:05.  The final score was Johns Hopkins 74, MIT 76.  Third place went to SUNY Geneseo with 141 points.  Also racing for MIT were Emily Niu '21 in 61st in 23:16, Tessa Weiss '20 74th in 23:25 and Jenny Xu '19 in 23:42.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT will not race until 10/29 when both the men and women compete to defend their conference titles.  The men, who have never lost the title, will be going for number 20, while the women will be attempting their 11th in a row.  In five weeks both the men and women hope to return to do battle again at Principia College.  Both teams have their work cut out for them if they hope to achieve their goals.

    Bacher Leads Women to Victory, Men Fail Without Maloney
    
    
                      
    
    September 16, 2017
    
    
                      
    
    MIT Men's and Women's Cross Country traveled to the western part of the state to race in its first intercollegiate meet of the year, the Purple Valley Classic hosted by Williams College.  The women won the 6K handily against an impressive field despite not racing last year's #1 runner, Megan McCandless '20.  The men, not running any of their top seven from last year, did plan on racing #1 returner Dennis Maloney '19.  However, he came down with an ear infection and did not race.  His presence alone would have had the team finishing second.  If Nate Foss '20, running in a comfortable front position through four miles had not had difficulty with the 85 degree heat, the Engineers would have won.  As is the 8th ranked Engineers finished a disappointing sixth in a stellar field that included Nationally ranked #2 SUNY Geneseo, #4 Williams,  #14 RPI, #15 Amherst #18 Middlebury, and #24 Dickenson among the 26 entered teams.
    
    
                      
    
    The heat and cloudless sky had everyone looking for shade prior to race time.  The men raced first and right off Josh Rosenkranz '19, Kent Slaney '21, Billy Woltz '20, Nate Foss '20 and Aidan Gilson '19 positioned themselves just behind the front pack, running a comfortable pace.  Through the first three miles all five were close together, never more than seven seconds apart.  Ben Freed '18 moved up in the second mile to almost join the group, but then fell back in the third mile.
    
    
                      
    
    In the fourth mile, Gilson started thinking too much and lost the desire to win, falling back 22 seconds behind Rosenkranz.  Still, at the four mile mark the front four were within seven seconds of each other.   Foss was overwhelmed by the heat in the fifth mile, actually passing out at one point in the final mile.  He finished on his own, but ran a 6:35 final mile.  
    
    
                      
    
    Rosenkranz finished 10th on the hilly, challenging course in 26:41.  Slaney fell off a bit in the final mile to finish 17th in 26:53 followed by Woltz at 19th in 27:00.  Gilson was the fourth Tech runner, fading to 42nd in 27:25 with Freed closing out the scoring, finishing 56th in 27:41.  Foss would have certainly been in the top 25 and Maloney in the top five.  Still working on returning to competition are top seven runners from last year, Alex Knoedler '18, Daniel Weiss '19, Josh Derrick '20 and Steven Goldy '20.  When Tech competes in the Pre-National Championship in three weeks they should have a different looking top seven.
    
    
                      
    
    The women, ranked #3 in the country, were up against #4 Williams, #5 SUNY Geneseo, #7 Ithaca, #8 Middlebury, #12 RPI, #16 Dickinson, #17 St. Lawrence, #26 Tufts and #35 Rochester.  The plan was to hold back a bit and run a group race behind the main pack, which meant the top three runners were able to run  far in front of the pack with none of our runners going after them.
    
    
                      
    
    At the mile mark, the MIT pack was slightly trailing the chase pack with Katie Bacher '20, Marissa McPhillips '20 and Mary Eccles '18  at 5:56 running comfortably.  Just off that lead chase group were Leandra Zimmermann '19, Katie Collins '21, Tessa Weiss '20, Lindsey McAllister '21 and Jenna Melanson '20, all between 6:00 and 6:01.  All was looking pretty good for the Engineers.
    
    
                      
    
    Coming through two miles a little separation occurred with Eccles falling off :03, 12:17 to 12:14 for Bacher and McPhillips.  Collins stayed aggressive at 12:24, but the rest of her group did not stay with her.  Zimmermann was 12:30 with McAllister at 12:33, Weiss at 12:37 and Melanson at 12:38. Overall the group stayed together well given the large hill at the end of mile two.
    
    
                      
    
    At mile three, Bacher and McPhillips pulled away, running 5:48 for the mostly downhill mile.  Eccles lost :10 to her teammates at 5:58.  Zimmermann had a good mile, almost catching back up to Collins.  Weiss and McAllister ran well, but lost at least 17 seconds on the mile.  
    
    
                      
    
    In the final .72 Bacher pulled away, from the chase group, coming within :05 to catching third place, finishing in fourth in 22:17.  McPhillips closed well until the final straight where she looked as though she might collapse.  She lost :31 to Bacher in the final leg of the course, finishing in 10th in 22:48, one place behind Eccles in 22:47.  Zimmermann closed well, finishing in 14th in 22:57.  Collins closed out the scoring in 18th in 23:08.  The five finished with a score of 55 points, 36 points ahead of McGill University from Canada and 76 points ahead of #5 ranked Geneseo and 91 points ahead of #4 ranked Williams.
    
    
                      
    
    All in all it was a pretty good day for the Engineers.  The next race for MIT is in two weeks at the NEICAAA Championship where all Division I, II and III teams in New England will vie for bragging rights as the top team, regardless of Division.
