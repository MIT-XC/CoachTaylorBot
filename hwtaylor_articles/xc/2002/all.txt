    ALUMNI**
    
    
    
    September 7, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    Many MIT Alumni showed up at Franklin Park on Saturday, but only
    four raced, forcing the score to be decided on each team's top four
    finishers. Sean Nolan did not seem bothered by the 90 degree
    temperatures as he easily won the race and led the Varsity to a sweep
    (10 to 34) over the old-timers with a time of 25:20.
    
    
    
    
    
    Through the first three miles, Sean and Ben Schmeckpeper were
    helping each other through a split of 15:27. Ben dropped back soon
    after that due to what turned out to be no skin left on the front
    part of the bottoms of his feet. He decided to race without socks and
    paid the price. Even with that obvious pain he still finished second
    in 26:04.
    
    
    
    
    
    The second group of Steve Maltas, Albert Liu, Brian Anderson and
    Fivos Constantinou looked to have things in hand through two miles,
    but then a severe lack of concentration caused Anderson and
    Contantinou to fall back. Maltas attempted to stay with Nolan and
    Schmeckpeper, but fell into runner's limbo after two miles. Maltas
    and Liu placed 3rd and 4th respectively with times of 26:39 and
    27:04. Anderson and Constantinou fell back to 9th and 12th places
    respectively with times of 27:47 and 28:12.
    
    
    
    
    
    The race of the day went to freshman Eric Khatchadourian who began
    in the 3rd group and finished within :03 of Liu with a 5 mile time of
    27:07. Craig Wildman and Carlos Renjifo followed Eric to the finish
    line with 6th and 7th places in 27:16 and 27:25 to totally shutout
    the Alumni.
    
    
    
    
    
    Bob Collins was the first Has-Been finisher in 8th place, running
    27:30. Sean Montgomery and Rich Rosalez placed 15th and 16th with
    times of 29:05 and 29:12 respectively. Rod Hinman, showing a lot of
    fortitude to race without training, ran 34:03 to finish the score for
    the Alumni. The audience sported a very talented, but injured or out
    of shape, group of ex harriers. Chris McGuire, Mike Parkins, Josh
    Feldman, Alan Raphael and Chuck Van Buren were among those leading
    the cheers.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT plays host to the annual Engineer's Cup against RPI
    and WPI at Franklin Park. The women race at 1:00 with the men
    following at 2:00.

    **MIT REELS IN COAST GUARD IN CODFISH
    BOWL**
    
    
    
    September 28, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    Ranked behind Coast Guard in the conference, New England and NCAA
    polls, MIT went fishing for the very good Bear's harriers and took
    all of the 8000 meters to reel them in in a 47-53 victory in the 17
    team Codfish Bowl.
    
    
    
    
    
    After a lot of rain in the two days prior to the meet, the ground
    was a little soft but the weather was perfect with 70 degree, sunny
    skies. A strong wind affected the times but not the competition.
    Right from the start, Matt Griego of Brandeis and Chris Kapfer of the
    Merchant Marine Academy opened up a 40 meter lead in the first half
    mile. Sean Nolan of MIT, wanting to wait a little before moving to
    the front, was forced to pick up the pace earlier to prevent the two
    runners from breaking away. Stalking Sean and teammate Ben
    Schmeckpeper were five Coast Guard runners. The MIT runners were
    quite a distance back, patiently moving up to offer support.
    
    
    
    
    
    Going into the start of the fourth mile, MIT finally took the lead
    team wise. Nolan had broken away and Schmeckpeper had moved into 3rd.
    Steve Maltas had moved up to 9th behind two Coast Guard runners in
    5th and 8th. Two more Coast Guard runners at 11th and 13th were just
    ahead of three MIT runners in 15th, 16th and 17th with the 5th Coast
    Guard runner right beside them. Things were looking good for Tech,
    but Coast Guard had certainly not given up.
    
    
    
    
    
    A normally strong 4th mile for MIT, turned into an even stronger
    4th mile for Coast Guard. The first 9 places did not change but Coast
    Guard moved up to 10th, 12th and 14th, while MIT fell back to 16th
    and 19th. At that point, the score was tied 49 to 49. 
    
    
    
    
    
    The final mile belonged to Brian Anderson and his 4:51 kick. Nolan
    won going away with a 4:50 final loop giving him a 9 second victory
    over Kapfer. Schmeckpeper held on for 3rd, 11 seconds behind Nolan.
    Maltas could not gain ground on Coast Guard runners Schuck in 6th and
    Bartonicek in 8th, finishing 9th, just ahead of Dowthit of Coast
    Guard in a furious dash to the finish. Burgess of Coast Guard
    finished 12th and Spector slipped to 17th. Anderson moved all the way
    up from 21st to 15th in the final mile and MIT's Craig Wildman
    finished 19th to give MIT the narrow 6 point margin. Coast Guard's
    :36 spread showed how good they are and convinced MIT's Engineers
    they were lucky to get away with the victory.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT takes the next week off and will next race on October 11th at
    Franklin Park in the All Division New England Championship.

    **MIT ENGINEERS NEAR
    SWEEP**
    
    
    
    September 14, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    The dog days of September slowed the MIT men's cross country team
    down a bit, but it could not prevent them from putting together a
    near sweep over rival engineering schools, RPI and WPI. MIT's score
    of 16 points was one point more than a perfect score as the men from
    Cambridge placed 1,2,3,4, and 6 to outdistance RPI with 45 points and
    WPI with 85.
    
    
    
    
    
    Right from the gun, Sean Nolan and Ben Schmeckpeper took control
    of the race, going through the first mile in 4:56 on the hot and
    humid day. A lone RPI runner, Keith Weiss, was right with them and
    his teammates were clustered close behind to give the impression they
    were taking the race to MIT. The difficult second mile had its usual
    effect of bringing opponents back to reality and placing MIT well
    ahead of the visitors from Troy and Worcester.
    
    
    
    
    
    By the end of the third mile, it was apparent the weather was
    going to have an effect on the times as nearly all of the runners
    began slowing. It was equally apparent that MIT was slowing down less
    than RPI and WPI as freshman Steve Maltas moved into 3rd place and
    Craig Wildman was about to move into 4th.
    
    
    
    
    
    With Albert Liu not racing due to the lack of sleep he had been
    missing as he finished his thesis, Brian Anderson knew he would have
    to step up to help his teammates. At the end of mile four he had
    moved up to the Weiss from RPI and Wildman. Apparently he had a
    furious last mile as he finished :06 ahead of Weiss to move into 4th.
    Weiss stayed tough and passed Wildman to prevent the sweep.
    
    
    
    
    
    Giving support for MIT were Carlos Renjifo in 8th, David Gray in
    9th, George Hanson in 10th, Fivos Constantinou in 11th and Eric
    Khatchadourian in 12th, all within :35 of each other.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT was able to manage a 2:00 delta for runners 1-10, a
    significant improvement from last week. Perhaps even more important
    was the fact that the top 5 runners were only seperated by 1:06, and
    this was without Liu.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the top 9 runners will make their way to St. Olaf
    College in Northfield, MN to run in the St. Olaf Invitational and
    take the opportunity to run on the national championship course. The
    remaining runners will race in the UMass Dartmouth Invitational.

    **MIT PLACES 2ND IN JAMES EARLY
    INVITATIONAL**
    
    
    
    **ENGINEERS CAN'T KEEP PACE WITH
    JUMBOS**
    
    
    
    
    
    October 19, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    On a day threatened by rain, but otherwise perfect for cross
    country, MIT ran a less than aggressive race and could not catch the
    Jumbos of Tufts University at the James Early Invitational at
    Westfield State College. MIT ended up 2nd with 85 points in the 27
    team field, behind Tufts 72 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    A casual start, combined with passive middle miles, prevented MIT
    from running their best race. In the first mile, Sean Nolan and Ben
    Schmeckpeper let Chris Kapfer of the US Merchant Marine Academy get a
    4 second lead, and never tried to close the gap. Without freshman
    star Steve Maltas in the lineup, the Engineers depended on Albert
    Liu, Brian Anderson, Carlos Renjifo and Craig Wildman to close the
    usually large delta and run with the opponents 3rd, 4th and 5th
    runners. While Tufts had five of their runners in front of MIT's 3rd
    runner at the mile, it seemed the Engineers were close enough to
    perform their usual magic and close the gap by the 4th mile.
    
    
    
    
    
    Mile two showed improvement for the chase group but Tufts still
    had a large advantage, as did Coast Guard. Nolan and Schmeckpeper
    were waiting for each other to make a move, but neither did. Anderson
    and Liu moved up in the field, as did Renjifo and Wildman. As they
    entered the woods, not to be seen again until they were 600 meters
    from the finish, it seemed that Tech was in control and should come
    out ahead.
    
    
    
    
    
    When they returned to the field for the finish, Nolan was in a
    solid 2nd place, 4 seconds behind Kapfer. Schmeckpeper was in 4th, 6
    seconds behind Nolan. Anderson did his job of closing the gap by
    finishing 1:05 behind Nolan, and with Maltas in the lineup, it would
    have been enough. But without him, there were not enough Engineers to
    run with Tufts, who put 4 runners between MIT's 2nd and 3rd runners
    and another between their 3rd and 4th. Coast Guard, missing their
    number 1 runner, was not able to make up for their loss, finishing
    3rd with 108 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT needs to a little better if they hope to defend their NEWMAC
    Conference Championship on November 2. A healthy Coast Guard squad
    will be too much to handle with this type of effort. The NEWMAC
    Championship will be hosted by Wellesley College and run on the local
    golf course.

    **SCHMECKPEPER EARNS ALL AMERICA, NOLAN FALTERS AT FINISH 
        IN NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
      
    
    November 23, 2002
    
    
      
    
    Ben Schmeckpeper finished 32nd at the NCAA Division III National 
        Championship, earning All America honors as a sophomore. Sean Nolan, running 
        in 25th place with 400 meters to go, lost motor control of his body, falling 
        numerous times in the final 100 meters as he lost about :20 seconds and 44 
        places, finishing 69th in the field of over 200 finishers.
    
    
      
    
    Even though the MIT pair of Nolan and Schmeckpeper had finished 
        6th and 10th respectively at the NCAA Regional Qualifying race, both were 
        certain they could earn All America honors by finishing in the top 35 at Nationals 
        one week later. The 35 degree temperatures and fierce wind did nothing to 
        change their plans, in fact, it may have fortified them. 
    
    
      
    
    The alleyed start saw Schmeckpeper in the front of the inside 
        group with Nolan just a second or two back. Settling in after the first quarter 
        mile, no one wanted to take the lead and the pace slowed with Schmeckpeper 
        in 5th and Nolan in 15th at the mile in 4:45. During the 2nd mile the MIT 
        duo was passed by a few of the eventual front runners who had taken it easy 
        in the first mile, but both were in the top 30 at the end of the 2nd mile. 
        At mile three, Nolan was around 20th in 15:13 with Schmeckpeper just behind 
        in 15:17. They seemed in solid position but the 4th mile with its long hill 
        was yet to come.
    
    
      
    
    Coming up the long hill, Nolan was holding onto his top 25 position 
        with Schmeckpeper :03 back, and both still looking okay. It was at this point 
        that Nolan said he knew he was in trouble. Nevertheless, he did not back off, 
        determined to make his last season a good one. Going down the hill he started 
        to feel better, but as he entered the pond loop with a little over a half 
        mile to go, he began to lose his balance. Still, he held on to 25th place. 
        Coming out of the pond loop and going up a little hill, Nolan was really beginning 
        to struggle. Coming down the other side of that hill and rounding the turn 
        to go up the final steep incline to the finish, he began to wobble, yet he 
        still held on to his place. Going up the hill Nolan had to virtually crawl 
        up to the final plateau, then with less than 15 meters to the finish, he fell. 
        This time, it was not certain he could get up as it was apparent he barely 
        knew where he was. Summoning an inner strength born of a prior immense passion 
        to do well in this race, Nolan struggled across the finish in 26:05.
    
    
      
    
    Schmeckpeper, stunned by his teammates fall, faltered slightly, 
        losing a couple of places, before realizing he needed to finish. Finish he 
        did, earning the highest finish ever for an MIT sophomore, with his 25:47, 
        at the NCAA Division III National Championship.
    
    
      
    
    It is time to take some time off and gear up for the long Indoor 
        Track season where both runners have goals of qualifying for nationals in 
        the 5000 meters and earning All America honors once there.

        A TEAM**
    
    
      
    
    **Nolan and Schmeckpeper Lead Way With All New England Performances**
    
    
      
    
    November 16, 2002
    
    
      
    
    MIT Men's Cross Country team finished 7th in the 35 team New 
        England Region field in the New England Division III Championship / NCAA Division 
        III Regional Qualifier with 193 points. Led by national qualifiers Sean Nolan 
        and Ben Schmeckpeper, the Tech harriers were not able to make up the gap left 
        by injured Steve Maltas.
    
    
      
    
    Thirty five degree temperatures and light snow provided a less 
        than perfect race day at Stanley Park, across from Westfield State University. 
        MIT's team thought they had a slim chance to secure one of the four national 
        spots, but it would require a near perfect race to be the team to finish ahead 
        of Bates, Connecticut College, Trinity, Tufts and the US Coast Guard Academy. 
        The loss of Maltas, who averaged finishing :40 behind Nolan, would have made 
        up approximately 45 points for MIT, enough to challenge Connecticut College, 
        who finished with 151 points to finish 4th and earn the final NCAA spot behind 
        Keene State, Bowdoin and Williams.
    
    
      
    
    A somewhat slow first mile of 4:50 was dictated by national 
        favorite Ryan Bak of Trinity. No one wanted to go in front of Bak so the pace 
        dragged along until he was ready to move. MIT had Nolan and Schmeckpeper in 
        the top 10 at 4:52. Even though the plan was to have the rest of the Tech 
        runners between 10-12 seconds back of Nolan, which they did, it was too far 
        back given the slow pace because it put them back in 60th or so place instead 
        of the 40-45th place that was planned.
    
    
      
    
    Bak and Mark Miller of Keene State made a move in the 2nd mile, 
        opening up a 50 meter lead. Brian Anderson kept the pace of staying within 
        :12 per mile of Nolan and Schmeckpeper, but Albert Liu and Carlos Renjifo 
        were not able to handle the pace on this day. The splitting up of the second 
        group made the matter worse as they were less likely to run well on their 
        own.
    
    
      
    
    By the 3rd mile mark, Nolan had moved up in the pack of 10 while 
        Schmeckpeper fell back by :03. Anderson continued to keep pace, but the group 
        was not seperated by twenty two seconds. Erik Khatchadourian, who had started 
        a little slower, was moving up and closing in on Renjifo.
    
    
      
    
    The 4th mile did MIT in. Nolan and Schmeckpeper continued to 
        stay with the leaders, but Anderson lost focus and a valuable extra :10. The 
        worst of the news was that the 5th man lost :28 in separation from Nolan just 
        in the 4th mile. MIT closed well but was unable to close enough to make up 
        the difference lost in the previous two miles.
    
    
      
    
    Nolan, Schmeckpeper and Khatchadourian ran personal bests on 
        the course, while Anderson ran an all-time personal best, breaking 26:00 for 
        the first time with his 25:58.
    
    
      
    
    Next Saturday, Nolan and Schmeckpeper will run in the NCAA Division 
        III Championship held at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota.

    FRANKLIN PARK**
    
    
    
    
    
    October 11, 2002
    
    
    
    
    
    The 60 degree temperatures and light drizzle guaranteed a fast
    race in the All Division New England Championship, the one race each
    year that allows the best teams from Division I, II and III to go at
    each other to see who rules New England. Providence College, the 14th
    ranked team in Division I, cruised to an easy overall victory with a
    36 point total and boasted the individual champion, Adam Sutton with
    an impressive time of 23:31 on the 4.95 mile course. UMass Lowell,
    the 7th ranked team in Division II, held their own, finishing 4th.
    The Division III schools were led by Keene State in 7th, ranked 6th
    in the nation and Williams in 9th, the 9th ranked team. Bates College
    finished in 10th, Bowdoin in 11th (10th ranked) and MIT 12th (19th
    ranked) in the 46 team field.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT was led by Ben Schmeckpeper, who ran an all time PR of 24:44,
    the second fastest ever by an MIT runner on the Franklin Park course,
    which was revised in 1992. Ben finished 15th overall to earn All New
    England honors. Sean Nolan followed closely behind in 24:52, also a
    Franklin Park PR, good for 23rd place. Freshman Steve Maltas
    continued to improve each race with a 25:33 for 64th position, his
    first time under 26 minutes. Tech's weakness, a large gap between 3rd
    and 4th runners, continued to haunt them, even though Brian Anderson
    ran a personal best of 26:18 on the course. Despite getting very
    little sleep this week due to academic commitments, Brian finished
    135th place. Carlos Renjifo finished 5th for MIT and 145th overall
    with an all time PR of 26:24 to close out the scoring.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT ran a very well paced race, showing patience and focus en
    route to their outstanding finish. In the sub varsity race, Tech ran
    even better, placing in a tie for 3rd in the 26 team field, first
    among Division II and III colleges. MIT boasted a :21 spread for
    their top 5 runners, led by Albert Liu in 26:25. Freshmen, Eric
    Khatchadourian (26:28), David Gray (26:35) and Fivos Constantinou
    (26:43) followed to show Tech's depth and youth. Ian Driver closed
    out the scoring with a personal best of 26:46 to place 51st overall.
    MIT placed 12 runners in the two races within 2:11 of each other.
    
    
    
    
    
    Only four teams from the New England region can go on to compete
    at the NCAA Division III Championship. MIT, finishing in 5th in this
    meet and 50 points behind the 4th team, has a lot of work to do if
    they hope to return to the national championship on November
    23rd.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, the Engineers travel to Westfield State to run in the
    James Early Invitational and test the regional qualifying course.
    Many, if not all of the top Division III teams in the region will be
    there, this time without the Division I competition.

    In what turned out to be basically a dual meet, 
        MIT ran past Coast Guard to remain the only team to ever win the New England 
        Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Men's Cross Country Championship 
        with their 5th consecutive win. MIT placed 6 of their runners in the top 10 
        to score 25 points to Coast Guard's 38. In a close battle for 3rd, Babson 
        College outpointed Wheaton, WPI and Springfield 114 to 120 to 122 for both 
        WPI and Springfield. Clark brought up the rear with 220 points.
    
    
      
    
    With a plan to go out hard on the 5.1 mile, 
        hilly course, Sean Nolan and Ben Schmeckpeper took the lead and set a hard 
        pace on the slow course with a 4:52 first mile. As expected, the top Coast 
        Guard runners followed, but were soon strung out as they were not all able 
        to hold the pace. MIT's second group, starting out a little slower than expected, 
        nevertheless set to their task of picking off the tiring runners. By the 2 
        mile mark, the plan showed signs of success as MIT's second group has indeed 
        closed on Coast Guard's 3rd runner and had positioned 5 runners ahead of Coast 
        Guard's 4th.
    
    
      
    
    Up front, Sean Nolan and Ben Schmeckpeper led 
        a determined Ian Bartonicek from Coast Guard over the many loops of the golf 
        course. Just before the 3 mile mark, Schmeckpeper began to fall off the fast 
        pace. For the next 1 1/2 miles Bartonicek was Nolan's shadow. Coming down 
        the final hill, Nolan opened up a lead that expanded to 4 seconds at the finish 
        line in 26:10.
    
    
      
    
    Schmeckpeper held on for 3rd, :22 ahead of Dowthit 
        of Coast Guard. Albert Liu showed he is determined to finish his career in 
        style as he finished in 5th ahead of a Babson College runner (the only non 
        MIT / Coast Guard runner in the top 11) he had never beaten. Freshman Eric 
        Khatchadourian ran the race of the year with a beautifully paced race to finish 
        7th overall. Carlos Renjifo finished 9th, just behind the 3rd Coast Guard 
        runner to close out MIT's top 5. Brian Anderson also finished in the top 10, 
        just behind Renjifo.
    
    
      
    
    MIT is still hoping to return #3 runner, freshman 
        Steve Maltas to action in time for the NCAA Regional Qualifier on 11/16. In 
        case Maltas does not make it back from his lower back injury, the supporting 
        members of the MIT harriers seem to be determined to get the job done regardless. 
        With 4 spots allotted for advancement to Nationals from the New England Region 
        and with dominant teams like Keene State, Bowdoin and Williams almost assured 
        of one of the four spots, teams like Bates, Tufts, Trinity, Connecticut College 
        and MIT will see who wants it the most on race day.

    The MIT Men's Cross Country team traveled to Northfield, MN to
    race in the St. Olaf Invitational and get a preview of the NCAA
    Championship course. Spurred on by the local fans and friends, Ben
    Schmeckpeper, from Wisconsin, and Steve Maltas, from Illinois, ran
    personal bests and led MIT to a 3rd place finish behind 3rd ranked
    North Central and 20th ranked UW Steven's Point, but ahead of 17th
    ranked Washington University out of St. Louis and 18th ranked UW
    Platteville.
    
    
    
    
    
    The many turns, tall grass and hilly latter part of the course led
    to somewhat slow times despite the excellent competition. The 230+
    runners ran hard at the start, fearing the narrow course less than a
    half mile into the course and the MIT runners got caught up in it as
    well, running the first mile in 4:56 for Schmeckpeper and Sean Nolan.
    North Central ran a better paced race, taking over after the 2nd mile
    and running away with a low score of 27 points. 
    
    
    
    
    
    After three miles, Nolan began to fade a bit, but Maltas continued
    to move up, at least until he got a rather large rock stuck between
    his spikes that would not come loose for over a mile. Brian Anderson,
    again starting very fast, faded a lot in the 3rd and 4th miles.
    Carlos Renjifo, Craig Wildman and Albert Liu worked well through the
    crowds, gradually moving up in the middle miles. Freshmen Eric
    Khatchadourian and David Gray ran very well but were in the back of
    the top third of the field. 
    
    
    
    
    
    The final mile, mostly downhill until the finish, saw Schmeckpeper
    finish well, placing 3rd with a 25:45 and having too much left. Nolan
    placed 10th but paid the price for not sleeping Thursday night due to
    academic work, finishing behind Schmeckpeper for the first time.
    Maltas also finished strong, placing 14th, only :28 behind
    Schmeckpeper to provide MIT with a good 1-2-3 punch. The difference
    between Steven's Point and MIT was the 4th and 5th men. Steven's
    Point placed 17th and 24th while MIT placed 35th (Anderson) and 36th
    (Renjifo), exposing the :51 gap between their 3rd and 4th men.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT is not nationally ranked and based on the spread between the
    top 5 runners, will not likely move into the nations top 20. Next
    week, MIT gets a chance to improve against some of the best teams in
    the New England Region at the Codfish Bowl at Franklin Park. After
    winning the Codfish Bowl in 1998 and 1999, the Engineers have
    finished 2nd the past two years.
