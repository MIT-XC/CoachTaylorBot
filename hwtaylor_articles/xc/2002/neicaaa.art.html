<P>October 11, 2002</P>

<P>The 60 degree temperatures and light drizzle guaranteed a fast
race in the All Division New England Championship, the one race each
year that allows the best teams from Division I, II and III to go at
each other to see who rules New England. Providence College, the 14th
ranked team in Division I, cruised to an easy overall victory with a
36 point total and boasted the individual champion, Adam Sutton with
an impressive time of 23:31 on the 4.95 mile course. UMass Lowell,
the 7th ranked team in Division II, held their own, finishing 4th.
The Division III schools were led by Keene State in 7th, ranked 6th
in the nation and Williams in 9th, the 9th ranked team. Bates College
finished in 10th, Bowdoin in 11th (10th ranked) and MIT 12th (19th
ranked) in the 46 team field.</P>

<P>MIT was led by Ben Schmeckpeper, who ran an all time PR of 24:44,
the second fastest ever by an MIT runner on the Franklin Park course,
which was revised in 1992. Ben finished 15th overall to earn All New
England honors. Sean Nolan followed closely behind in 24:52, also a
Franklin Park PR, good for 23rd place. Freshman Steve Maltas
continued to improve each race with a 25:33 for 64th position, his
first time under 26 minutes. Tech's weakness, a large gap between 3rd
and 4th runners, continued to haunt them, even though Brian Anderson
ran a personal best of 26:18 on the course. Despite getting very
little sleep this week due to academic commitments, Brian finished
135th place. Carlos Renjifo finished 5th for MIT and 145th overall
with an all time PR of 26:24 to close out the scoring.</P>

<P>MIT ran a very well paced race, showing patience and focus en
route to their outstanding finish. In the sub varsity race, Tech ran
even better, placing in a tie for 3rd in the 26 team field, first
among Division II and III colleges. MIT boasted a :21 spread for
their top 5 runners, led by Albert Liu in 26:25. Freshmen, Eric
Khatchadourian (26:28), David Gray (26:35) and Fivos Constantinou
(26:43) followed to show Tech's depth and youth. Ian Driver closed
out the scoring with a personal best of 26:46 to place 51st overall.
MIT placed 12 runners in the two races within 2:11 of each other.</P>

<P>Only four teams from the New England region can go on to compete
at the NCAA Division III Championship. MIT, finishing in 5th in this
meet and 50 points behind the 4th team, has a lot of work to do if
they hope to return to the national championship on November
23rd.</P>

<P>Next week, the Engineers travel to Westfield State to run in the
James Early Invitational and test the regional qualifying course.
Many, if not all of the top Division III teams in the region will be
there, this time without the Division I competition.</P>
