BOWL</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>September 28, 2002</P>

<P>Ranked behind Coast Guard in the conference, New England and NCAA
polls, MIT went fishing for the very good Bear's harriers and took
all of the 8000 meters to reel them in in a 47-53 victory in the 17
team Codfish Bowl.</P>

<P>After a lot of rain in the two days prior to the meet, the ground
was a little soft but the weather was perfect with 70 degree, sunny
skies. A strong wind affected the times but not the competition.
Right from the start, Matt Griego of Brandeis and Chris Kapfer of the
Merchant Marine Academy opened up a 40 meter lead in the first half
mile. Sean Nolan of MIT, wanting to wait a little before moving to
the front, was forced to pick up the pace earlier to prevent the two
runners from breaking away. Stalking Sean and teammate Ben
Schmeckpeper were five Coast Guard runners. The MIT runners were
quite a distance back, patiently moving up to offer support.</P>

<P>Going into the start of the fourth mile, MIT finally took the lead
team wise. Nolan had broken away and Schmeckpeper had moved into 3rd.
Steve Maltas had moved up to 9th behind two Coast Guard runners in
5th and 8th. Two more Coast Guard runners at 11th and 13th were just
ahead of three MIT runners in 15th, 16th and 17th with the 5th Coast
Guard runner right beside them. Things were looking good for Tech,
but Coast Guard had certainly not given up.</P>

<P>A normally strong 4th mile for MIT, turned into an even stronger
4th mile for Coast Guard. The first 9 places did not change but Coast
Guard moved up to 10th, 12th and 14th, while MIT fell back to 16th
and 19th. At that point, the score was tied 49 to 49. </P>

<P>The final mile belonged to Brian Anderson and his 4:51 kick. Nolan
won going away with a 4:50 final loop giving him a 9 second victory
over Kapfer. Schmeckpeper held on for 3rd, 11 seconds behind Nolan.
Maltas could not gain ground on Coast Guard runners Schuck in 6th and
Bartonicek in 8th, finishing 9th, just ahead of Dowthit of Coast
Guard in a furious dash to the finish. Burgess of Coast Guard
finished 12th and Spector slipped to 17th. Anderson moved all the way
up from 21st to 15th in the final mile and MIT's Craig Wildman
finished 19th to give MIT the narrow 6 point margin. Coast Guard's
:36 spread showed how good they are and convinced MIT's Engineers
they were lucky to get away with the victory.</P>

<P>MIT takes the next week off and will next race on October 11th at
Franklin Park in the All Division New England Championship.</P>
