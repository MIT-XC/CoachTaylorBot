</FONT></B></CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=6> </FONT><FONT SIZE=4>After an impressive showing
last week at the NEIAAA Championships, the MIT Men's Cross Country
Team was looking forward to their next competition.  The fact
that it was at Franklin Park, which is the fastest course the
team has run this year, combined with the opportunity to win the
6th straight conference title, had the team ready to run.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The goal of the team was to sweep the first five
places.  While this was a lofty goal, all in the top 5 thought
that it was doable.  The game plan was to stick with what has
been successful thus far, which is run in designated groups and
communicate for much of the race.  The plan started out well,
with the first group coming through the first mile in 5:00 and
the second group in 5:13.  At 1 1/2 miles, a downhill combined
with a lack of communication separated the first group.  At 2
miles it was obvious that Arnold Seto 'G was going for the victory,
and that the others were caught between trying to go with him
and sticking with the group.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Due to MIT's depth, the Engineers held on for an
easy victory, scoring 30 points to Springfield's  and Coast Guard's
55 points.  Completing the list of teams was Norwich (134), WPI
(147), Babson (148), and Clark (208).  However, instead of the
normal 30 seconds or less delta among the top 5 that MIT is accustomed
to seeing this season, the gap was 1 minute.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The 10 + inches of rain that fell in the last week,
combined with the seasonably warm temperatures certainly slowed
the runners down a bit, nevertheless, Seto held on for victory
with a time of 25:45, earning him CAC Runner of the Year.  Josh
Feldman '97 followed Arnie in 5th place in 26:06.  Close behind
Josh were Mike Parkins in 6th with a 26:09, and CAC Rookie of
the Year, Chris McGuire '00 in 26:17 for 7th.  Dan Helgesen '97
rounded out the scoring for MIT, finishing 11th in 26:45.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> After a weekend off from competing, Tech will prepare
for the NCAA Qualifier at Westfield State College on November
9th.  Currently, the Engineers are seeded 4th in New England and
only 2 teams can go to Nationals.  If the desire is there, and
the group running and communication are going well, MIT may be
able to surprise some people and qualify for the 2nd time in 3
years.</FONT>
