    **
    
    
    
     Saturday, at Franklin Park, the Varsity ran away from the Alumni
    by a 15-27 score.  Due to a number of Alums who were unable to
    make the contest, the meet was scored with the first 4 from each
    team instead of the normal 5 runners.  However, the 5-7 runners
    could be used to bump the oppositions score.  
    
    
    
     At the start of the race the lead group consisted of Ethan Crain
    '95, Jesse Darley '95, and Varsity members Arnold Seto '96, Mike
    Parkins '99, Leif Seed '99, Dan Helgesen '97, Josh Feldman '97,
    Omar Saleh '97, and freshman Chris McGuire.  They came through
    the relatively easy first mile in 5:12, but began to separate
    shortly afterward. 
    
    
    
     By the 2 mile mark the lead back was down to 6.  Crain and Darley
    were still there, but only Seto, Parkins, Seed, and McGuire were
    still representing the varsity in 10:36.  The remainder of the
    pack had fallen back to 10:40.  The other Alumnae, Sumner Brown
    '66, and Rod Hinman '88, were settled a little farther back, but
    moving up.
    
    
    
     Mile three saw McGuire drop back, although rumour has it that
    he did so willingly because he remembered he was supposed to be
    running with his group, to which he apologized when they caught
    up.  The first real surge during the fourth mile.  Jesse made
    a break and opened up a 30 meter gap.  However, just short of
    the 4 mile mark he made a slight detour that cost him about 20
    of those meters.  This move did serve to separate the group. 
     Darley, Seto, and Parkins came through 4 in 21:00, with Crain
    and Seed close behind.
    
    
    
     The last mile was a real burner.  Parkins covered the ground
    in 4:44 to win by 3 seconds over Darley.  Seto was another 8 seconds
    back.  Crain and Seed were 4 and 13 seconds behind Seto respectively.
     Overall it was a great performance by all.  Four runners were
    under 26:00, and 5 more Varsity runners were under 27:00.  Some
    of the great performances were at least in part due to the great
    weather, 60 degrees and overcast.
    
    
    
     The Varsity next competes at the Dartmouth College Invitational
    on Saturday the 14th.  Race time is 11:00.  In addition to Dartmouth,
    NCAA Division III Champ., Williams College will be there along
    with Brandeis College.
    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **MIT FALLS TO TUFTS AND BATES  
    
    **
    
    
    
    The MIT Harriers made an unsuccessful trip to Bates
    College to take on Bates and Tufts at Springbrook Golf Course.
     MIT expected to win for the 4th time in as many years, but instead
    came away losing to Tufts and Bates by a score of 28 - 49 - 52
    respectively.
    
    
    
    The team was hoping to rebound from last week's disappointing
    performance at the Dartmouth University Invitational.  Tufts ran
    the race exactly the way MIT usually runs their races when on
    hilly courses, which is to start out slowly, work up to the front
    and take control after the last big hill.  MIT did not go out
    exceptionally fast, and settled on a comfortable pace rather than
    staying aggressive as Bates did in front and Tufts did from behind.
     When Tufts caught up, MIT could not respond.
    
    
    
    Leading the way for the Engineers was Mike Parkins
    '99 in 5th place.  Mike has been the #1 runner all season.  Fading
    by over 25 seconds in the final mile, but holding onto 9th place
    was Arnold Seto G.  Closely following Arnie was Leif Seed in 10th.
     Freshman Chris McGuire continued to surprise as he held on for
    4th on the team and 13th overall. 
    
    
    
    Coach Halston Taylor thinks the team may have dead
    legs from so much slow mileage with no real speed training, as
    well as some poor tactical running.  "The team will be taking
    drastic measures to correct some earlier training problems and
    get back on track."  "We have 7 weeks before we really
    need to be ready for the Championships, so I am not worried",
    says Coach Taylor.
    
    
    
    This weekend the team travels to Cortland State College
    in New York for a major invitational.  There will be over 30 colleges
    involved and at least 3 of the top 10 ranked teams in the country
    for Division III.  
    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **MIT WINS 6TH CONSECUTIVE CAC TITLE  
    
    **
    
    
    
     After an impressive showing
    last week at the NEIAAA Championships, the MIT Men's Cross Country
    Team was looking forward to their next competition.  The fact
    that it was at Franklin Park, which is the fastest course the
    team has run this year, combined with the opportunity to win the
    6th straight conference title, had the team ready to run.
    
    
    
     The goal of the team was to sweep the first five
    places.  While this was a lofty goal, all in the top 5 thought
    that it was doable.  The game plan was to stick with what has
    been successful thus far, which is run in designated groups and
    communicate for much of the race.  The plan started out well,
    with the first group coming through the first mile in 5:00 and
    the second group in 5:13.  At 1 1/2 miles, a downhill combined
    with a lack of communication separated the first group.  At 2
    miles it was obvious that Arnold Seto 'G was going for the victory,
    and that the others were caught between trying to go with him
    and sticking with the group.
    
    
    
     Due to MIT's depth, the Engineers held on for an
    easy victory, scoring 30 points to Springfield's  and Coast Guard's
    55 points.  Completing the list of teams was Norwich (134), WPI
    (147), Babson (148), and Clark (208).  However, instead of the
    normal 30 seconds or less delta among the top 5 that MIT is accustomed
    to seeing this season, the gap was 1 minute.
    
    
    
     The 10 + inches of rain that fell in the last week,
    combined with the seasonably warm temperatures certainly slowed
    the runners down a bit, nevertheless, Seto held on for victory
    with a time of 25:45, earning him CAC Runner of the Year.  Josh
    Feldman '97 followed Arnie in 5th place in 26:06.  Close behind
    Josh were Mike Parkins in 6th with a 26:09, and CAC Rookie of
    the Year, Chris McGuire '00 in 26:17 for 7th.  Dan Helgesen '97
    rounded out the scoring for MIT, finishing 11th in 26:45.
    
    
    
     After a weekend off from competing, Tech will prepare
    for the NCAA Qualifier at Westfield State College on November
    9th.  Currently, the Engineers are seeded 4th in New England and
    only 2 teams can go to Nationals.  If the desire is there, and
    the group running and communication are going well, MIT may be
    able to surprise some people and qualify for the 2nd time in 3
    years.
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **HARRIERS IMPROVE, BUT NOT SATISFIED  
    
    **
    
    
    
    MIT Men's Cross Country Team competed at Cortland State College
    in the Cortland State Invitational this past Saturday.  Hoping
    to find an answer to their poor early season start, MIT faced
    8 of the top 20 NCAA Division III Teams as well as 16 others on
    a flat course with a lot of 90 degree turns.
    
    
    
    After a good week of practice, Tech felt like they were ready
    to start their season anew and hope for the best.  The JVs began
    the day with a really strong showing.  Rich Rosalez '98 went out
    close to the leaders and moved up throughout the entire race,
    finishing in 8th in a fine time of 27:57 on the wet course.  Following
    pretty close behind were Gabe White '00 in 12th, Frank Johnston
    '00 in 22nd, Sohail Husain '98 in 25th, and David Kelman '99 in
    52nd.  The good grouping of the top 4 led MIT to a 4th place finish
    with 106 points.
    
    
    
    The Varsity was up next and hoped to match the JV Team's performance.
     With 176 runners on this type of course, it was obvious that
    the pace would be fast at the start.  MIT went out with the leaders.
     The top 3 runners were in a group at around 25th place at the
    mile mark and the second 3 were in about 65th place.  Though they
    were running close to each other, the top 3 were not running together.
     The lack of communication and team support caused them to string
    out.  By mile 3, Arnie Seto G, was feeling the fatigue of the
    fast pace when Mike Parkins '99 came up to him.  Arnie could not
    respond and began the long fade back to 53rd place.  Leif Seed
    '99, the other runner in the lead group of MIT runners, also began
    to fade just before the 3 mile mark and ended up 105th.  The second
    group moved up throughout the race.  Josh Feldman '97 finished
    very strong, just 5 seconds behind Parkins in 26:38 for 33rd place.
     Josh was followed closely by freshman Chris McGuire, who worked
    well with Josh to finish in 26:52 for 42nd place.  Seto and Dan
    Helgesen '97 (75th) rounded out the scoring unit for a 7th place
    team finish.
    
    
    
    This race was by far the best for Tech since their opening season
    victory over the Alumni.  Feldman and McGuire provided a much
    needed strong race from start to finish, and only 20 seconds behind
    Parkins.  If Seto, Helgesen, and Seed can move into their expected
    slots within the top 5, MIT should once again be a team not to
    be taken lightly.
    
    
    
    Showing little success running from the front, the harriers will
    work a little harder at group running.  With a week off from competition,
    Tech will work hard in preparation for the trip to Lacrosse, Wisconsin
    for the Jim Drew's Invitational.  As many as 10 more top 20 teams
    as well as the University of Wisconsin will compete on last year's
    National Championship Course.    
    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **MIT HARRIERS RUN POORLY AT DARTMOUTH  
    
      
    
    **
    
    
    
     The Men's Cross Country Team embarked on the beginning
    of a very difficult journey on Saturday.  Facing the most challenging
    schedule in the last 15 years, the Techmen tightened up their
    spikes for the season opener at the Dartmouth Invitational.  The
    results of this first stop were dismal as MIT placed 7th out of
    10 teams.
    
    
    
     The intent of the new schedule is to force the team
    to live up to their potential.  Last year, against a relatively
    easy schedule, the team grew complacent and did not challenge
    each other.  At the end of the season they had forgotten what
    it was like to have to race.
    
    
    
     This first meet included very good Division I teams,
    Dartmouth and Boston University, as well as Division III National
    Champion, Williams College.  Others racing were the University
    of Rhode Island representing Division I, Keene State and UMass/Lowell
    representing Division II, and Bates and Brandeis in Division III.
     As can be seen, there was top to bottom quality at this meet.
    
    
    
     MIT followed part of their game plan, which was
    to go out conservatively on the very hilly golf course, but the
    second part was ignored.  The plan was to stay in contention while
    being conservative.  The first MIT runner at the mile mark was
    in 70th position at best.  The course was too difficult and crowded
    to make up that much ground.
    
    
    
     So although the Techmen made up a lot of ground,
    it left them quite spent by mile four.  The look on the MIT runner's
    faces was one of total lack of focus; it is called the survival
    look.  Instead of finishing the race well, MIT consistently got
    out-kicked at the finish line.  
    
    
    
     Those running good times, but not necessarily good
    races were Gus Blomquist (29:54), Frank Johnston (28:11), Ray
    Molnar (31:05), Ryan Peoples (31:39), and Gabe White (27:54) with
    a personal best.
    
    
    
     Coach Halston Taylor says, "things should improve
    dramatically in the next two weeks.  If not, it will be a very
    long season with the schedule that we have.  I know we have a
    good team, but they have to develop more pride when it comes to
    letting teams run all over you."
    
    
    
     Next week the Engineers go up against Bates and
    Tufts at Bates at 3:00 on the 21st.

    **MIT BEATS 4 TOP 20 TEAMS  
    
    **
    
    
    
     This past weekend, the Men's Cross Country Team
    placed 13th out of 18 teams in the Jim Drew's Invitational at
    LaCrosse, Wisconsin.  MIT competed in the seeded division which
    included 3 top ranked NCAA Division II colleges, as well as well
    as 11 top 20 ranked Division III colleges.  Just prior to the
    seeded race, an unseeded race was held to accomodate the large
    field of teams.  MIT's times would have been good enough to win
    the unseeded race and defeat Division III ranked Luther College
    which placed third in their race.
    
    
    
     The site of last year's National Championship, the
    course was challenging, but fast.  The winning time of 24:13 by
    Ambo Bati of Augustana College defeated last year's National Runner-up,
    Matt Brill of North Central College by 4 seconds.  MIT's first
    finisher was Arnold Seto 'G in 25:52 for 43rd place.  Close behind
    was Josh Feldman '97 in 25:59 for 53rd place, and Mike Parkins
    '99 in 26:01 for 56th place.  Rounding out the scoring for MIT
    were freshman Chris McGuire in 26:21 for 80th place, and Dan Helgesen
    '97 in 26:50 for 111th place.  The grouping of the top 4 was encouraging.
     Placing 4 within 30 seconds is always indicative of a successful
    team, but the loss of a close 5th man hurt the Engineers a lot.
     Placing another of MIT's very capable runners within the current
    top 4 would have earned them a 10th place finish ahead of 5th
    ranked RIT.
    
    
    
     Also making the trip and running for MIT was Gabe
    White '00 in 27:20, Rich Rosalez '98 in 27:21, Leif Seed '99 in
    27:23, and Frank Johnston '00 in 27:45.
    
    
    
     The top group for the Engineers broke apart right
    at the start.  Leif Seed went out a little fast for his level
    of experience and by himself in about 40th position.  Seto, Parkins,
    and McGuire were about 4 seconds behind at the mile mark, coming
    through in 4:56.  Behind them the group was running alone as Helgesen,
    and Feldman tried to keep up.  Josh runs a very steady race, moving
    up from the rear with great success.  The plan according to Coach
    Halston Taylor was for Josh to lead the group throughout the race.
     The first mile destroyed that plan, but nevertheless the team
    ran well.
    
    
    
     The second group of Rosalez, White, and Johnston,
    stayed together perfectly.  The only problem was that even though
    they ran together, they did not communicate and ran more of a
    single-file style, which does not facilitate good team running.
     
    
    
    
     Overall, the team ran more aggresively than previous
    meets, and seemed to be more in focus all through the race.  With
    4 weeks to go until the National Qualifying Meet, MIT has some
    definite work to do to run their best race.  "I think the
    team will realize their goals when the time comes, says Coach
    Taylor, I just hope they realize that they want it badly enough
    to make it happen."
    
    
    
     The next meet will be on Friday the 18th at Franklin
    Park for the NEIAAA Championships, which features all of the colleges
    in New England for Divisions I, II, and III.  This is typically
    a good test to see how well the team would place at the Division
    III Nationals.
    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    **MIT PLACES 10TH AT NEIAAA CHAMPIONSHIPS  
    
    **
    
    
    
     In the first race since the Alumni Meet, the Men's
    Cross Country Team showed their potential.  Even though they started
    a bit slow and got left at the starting line, Tech ran a great
    race, placing 10th in the All New England Meet (3rd among Division
    III Colleges).
    
    
    
     Doing their best group running of the year, the
    team gradually moved up from their poor start at about 100th position
    to finishes of 52 - 75 for the top 5 runners (Mike Parkins '99
    25:24 for 52nd, Chris McGuire '00 25:38 for 66th, Josh Feldman
    '97 25:38 for 67th, Arnold Seto 'G 25:45 for 74th, and Leif Seed
    '99 25:46 for 75th).  The most impressive part of this performance
    was the 22 second gap between the 5 runners.
    
    
    
     The successful running was not confined to the top
    group.  15 of the competing 17 runners ran season best times.
     The most significant of those was a 57 second improvement by
    Frank Johnston '00 who ran 26:48 to place 51st in the sub-varsity
    race.
    
    
    
     With only 2 teams from New England qualifying for
    the National Division III Championships, MIT must find a way to
    improve enough to earn one of those positions.  Currently, the
    engineers are seeded 4th behind Williams, Tufts, and Brandeis.
     The Regional Qualifier is in 3 weeks at Westfield State College.
    
    
    
     Next week, the Techmen must defend their Constitution
    Athletic Conference Championship at Franklin Park, which they
    have won 5 consecutive times.  Race time will be at 2:00.
    
    
    
    
    



        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **Varsity Runs Away With Alumni Meet  
        
        **
        
        
        
         Saturday, at Franklin Park, the Varsity ran away from the Alumni
        by a 15-27 score.  Due to a number of Alums who were unable to
        make the contest, the meet was scored with the first 4 from each
        team instead of the normal 5 runners.  However, the 5-7 runners
        could be used to bump the oppositions score.  
        
        
        
         At the start of the race the lead group consisted of Ethan Crain
        '95, Jesse Darley '95, and Varsity members Arnold Seto '96, Mike
        Parkins '99, Leif Seed '99, Dan Helgesen '97, Josh Feldman '97,
        Omar Saleh '97, and freshman Chris McGuire.  They came through
        the relatively easy first mile in 5:12, but began to separate
        shortly afterward. 
        
        
        
         By the 2 mile mark the lead back was down to 6.  Crain and Darley
        were still there, but only Seto, Parkins, Seed, and McGuire were
        still representing the varsity in 10:36.  The remainder of the
        pack had fallen back to 10:40.  The other Alumnae, Sumner Brown
        '66, and Rod Hinman '88, were settled a little farther back, but
        moving up.
        
        
        
         Mile three saw McGuire drop back, although rumour has it that
        he did so willingly because he remembered he was supposed to be
        running with his group, to which he apologized when they caught
        up.  The first real surge during the fourth mile.  Jesse made
        a break and opened up a 30 meter gap.  However, just short of
        the 4 mile mark he made a slight detour that cost him about 20
        of those meters.  This move did serve to separate the group. 
         Darley, Seto, and Parkins came through 4 in 21:00, with Crain
        and Seed close behind.
        
        
        
         The last mile was a real burner.  Parkins covered the ground
        in 4:44 to win by 3 seconds over Darley.  Seto was another 8 seconds
        back.  Crain and Seed were 4 and 13 seconds behind Seto respectively.
         Overall it was a great performance by all.  Four runners were
        under 26:00, and 5 more Varsity runners were under 27:00.  Some
        of the great performances were at least in part due to the great
        weather, 60 degrees and overcast.
        
        
        
         The Varsity next competes at the Dartmouth College Invitational
        on Saturday the 14th.  Race time is 11:00.  In addition to Dartmouth,
        NCAA Division III Champ., Williams College will be there along
        with Brandeis College.
        
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **MIT FALLS TO TUFTS AND BATES  
        
        **
        
        
        
        The MIT Harriers made an unsuccessful trip to Bates
        College to take on Bates and Tufts at Springbrook Golf Course.
         MIT expected to win for the 4th time in as many years, but instead
        came away losing to Tufts and Bates by a score of 28 - 49 - 52
        respectively.
        
        
        
        The team was hoping to rebound from last week's disappointing
        performance at the Dartmouth University Invitational.  Tufts ran
        the race exactly the way MIT usually runs their races when on
        hilly courses, which is to start out slowly, work up to the front
        and take control after the last big hill.  MIT did not go out
        exceptionally fast, and settled on a comfortable pace rather than
        staying aggressive as Bates did in front and Tufts did from behind.
         When Tufts caught up, MIT could not respond.
        
        
        
        Leading the way for the Engineers was Mike Parkins
        '99 in 5th place.  Mike has been the #1 runner all season.  Fading
        by over 25 seconds in the final mile, but holding onto 9th place
        was Arnold Seto G.  Closely following Arnie was Leif Seed in 10th.
         Freshman Chris McGuire continued to surprise as he held on for
        4th on the team and 13th overall. 
        
        
        
        Coach Halston Taylor thinks the team may have dead
        legs from so much slow mileage with no real speed training, as
        well as some poor tactical running.  "The team will be taking
        drastic measures to correct some earlier training problems and
        get back on track."  "We have 7 weeks before we really
        need to be ready for the Championships, so I am not worried",
        says Coach Taylor.
        
        
        
        This weekend the team travels to Cortland State College
        in New York for a major invitational.  There will be over 30 colleges
        involved and at least 3 of the top 10 ranked teams in the country
        for Division III.  
        
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **MIT WINS 6TH CONSECUTIVE CAC TITLE  
        
        **
        
        
        
         After an impressive showing
        last week at the NEIAAA Championships, the MIT Men's Cross Country
        Team was looking forward to their next competition.  The fact
        that it was at Franklin Park, which is the fastest course the
        team has run this year, combined with the opportunity to win the
        6th straight conference title, had the team ready to run.
        
        
        
         The goal of the team was to sweep the first five
        places.  While this was a lofty goal, all in the top 5 thought
        that it was doable.  The game plan was to stick with what has
        been successful thus far, which is run in designated groups and
        communicate for much of the race.  The plan started out well,
        with the first group coming through the first mile in 5:00 and
        the second group in 5:13.  At 1 1/2 miles, a downhill combined
        with a lack of communication separated the first group.  At 2
        miles it was obvious that Arnold Seto 'G was going for the victory,
        and that the others were caught between trying to go with him
        and sticking with the group.
        
        
        
         Due to MIT's depth, the Engineers held on for an
        easy victory, scoring 30 points to Springfield's  and Coast Guard's
        55 points.  Completing the list of teams was Norwich (134), WPI
        (147), Babson (148), and Clark (208).  However, instead of the
        normal 30 seconds or less delta among the top 5 that MIT is accustomed
        to seeing this season, the gap was 1 minute.
        
        
        
         The 10 + inches of rain that fell in the last week,
        combined with the seasonably warm temperatures certainly slowed
        the runners down a bit, nevertheless, Seto held on for victory
        with a time of 25:45, earning him CAC Runner of the Year.  Josh
        Feldman '97 followed Arnie in 5th place in 26:06.  Close behind
        Josh were Mike Parkins in 6th with a 26:09, and CAC Rookie of
        the Year, Chris McGuire '00 in 26:17 for 7th.  Dan Helgesen '97
        rounded out the scoring for MIT, finishing 11th in 26:45.
        
        
        
         After a weekend off from competing, Tech will prepare
        for the NCAA Qualifier at Westfield State College on November
        9th.  Currently, the Engineers are seeded 4th in New England and
        only 2 teams can go to Nationals.  If the desire is there, and
        the group running and communication are going well, MIT may be
        able to surprise some people and qualify for the 2nd time in 3
        years.
        
        
        
        
    
    
    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        **HARRIERS IMPROVE, BUT NOT SATISFIED  
        
        **
        
        
        
        MIT Men's Cross Country Team competed at Cortland State College
        in the Cortland State Invitational this past Saturday.  Hoping
        to find an answer to their poor early season start, MIT faced
        8 of the top 20 NCAA Division III Teams as well as 16 others on
        a flat course with a lot of 90 degree turns.
        
        
        
        After a good week of practice, Tech felt like they were ready
        to start their season anew and hope for the best.  The JVs began
        the day with a really strong showing.  Rich Rosalez '98 went out
        close to the leaders and moved up throughout the entire race,
        finishing in 8th in a fine time of 27:57 on the wet course.  Following
        pretty close behind were Gabe White '00 in 12th, Frank Johnston
        '00 in 22nd, Sohail Husain '98 in 25th, and David Kelman '99 in
        52nd.  The good grouping of the top 4 led MIT to a 4th place finish
        with 106 points.
        
        
        
        The Varsity was up next and hoped to match the JV Team's performance.
         With 176 runners on this type of course, it was obvious that
        the pace would be fast at the start.  MIT went out with the leaders.
         The top 3 runners were in a group at around 25th place at the
        mile mark and the second 3 were in about 65th place.  Though they
        were running close to each other, the top 3 were not running together.
         The lack of communication and team support caused them to string
        out.  By mile 3, Arnie Seto G, was feeling the fatigue of the
        fast pace when Mike Parkins '99 came up to him.  Arnie could not
        respond and began the long fade back to 53rd place.  Leif Seed
        '99, the other runner in the lead group of MIT runners, also began
        to fade just before the 3 mile mark and ended up 105th.  The second
        group moved up throughout the race.  Josh Feldman '97 finished
        very strong, just 5 seconds behind Parkins in 26:38 for 33rd place.
         Josh was followed closely by freshman Chris McGuire, who worked
        well with Josh to finish in 26:52 for 42nd place.  Seto and Dan
        Helgesen '97 (75th) rounded out the scoring unit for a 7th place
        team finish.
        
        
        
        This race was by far the best for Tech since their opening season
        victory over the Alumni.  Feldman and McGuire provided a much
        needed strong race from start to finish, and only 20 seconds behind
        Parkins.  If Seto, Helgesen, and Seed can move into their expected
        slots within the top 5, MIT should once again be a team not to
        be taken lightly.
        
        
        
        Showing little success running from the front, the harriers will
        work a little harder at group running.  With a week off from competition,
        Tech will work hard in preparation for the trip to Lacrosse, Wisconsin
        for the Jim Drew's Invitational.  As many as 10 more top 20 teams
        as well as the University of Wisconsin will compete on last year's
        National Championship Course.
