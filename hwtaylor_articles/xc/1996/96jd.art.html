</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> This past weekend, the Men's Cross Country Team
placed 13th out of 18 teams in the Jim Drew's Invitational at
LaCrosse, Wisconsin.  MIT competed in the seeded division which
included 3 top ranked NCAA Division II colleges, as well as well
as 11 top 20 ranked Division III colleges.  Just prior to the
seeded race, an unseeded race was held to accomodate the large
field of teams.  MIT's times would have been good enough to win
the unseeded race and defeat Division III ranked Luther College
which placed third in their race.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The site of last year's National Championship, the
course was challenging, but fast.  The winning time of 24:13 by
Ambo Bati of Augustana College defeated last year's National Runner-up,
Matt Brill of North Central College by 4 seconds.  MIT's first
finisher was Arnold Seto 'G in 25:52 for 43rd place.  Close behind
was Josh Feldman '97 in 25:59 for 53rd place, and Mike Parkins
'99 in 26:01 for 56th place.  Rounding out the scoring for MIT
were freshman Chris McGuire in 26:21 for 80th place, and Dan Helgesen
'97 in 26:50 for 111th place.  The grouping of the top 4 was encouraging.
 Placing 4 within 30 seconds is always indicative of a successful
team, but the loss of a close 5th man hurt the Engineers a lot.
 Placing another of MIT's very capable runners within the current
top 4 would have earned them a 10th place finish ahead of 5th
ranked RIT.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Also making the trip and running for MIT was Gabe
White '00 in 27:20, Rich Rosalez '98 in 27:21, Leif Seed '99 in
27:23, and Frank Johnston '00 in 27:45.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The top group for the Engineers broke apart right
at the start.  Leif Seed went out a little fast for his level
of experience and by himself in about 40th position.  Seto, Parkins,
and McGuire were about 4 seconds behind at the mile mark, coming
through in 4:56.  Behind them the group was running alone as Helgesen,
and Feldman tried to keep up.  Josh runs a very steady race, moving
up from the rear with great success.  The plan according to Coach
Halston Taylor was for Josh to lead the group throughout the race.
 The first mile destroyed that plan, but nevertheless the team
ran well.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The second group of Rosalez, White, and Johnston,
stayed together perfectly.  The only problem was that even though
they ran together, they did not communicate and ran more of a
single-file style, which does not facilitate good team running.
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Overall, the team ran more aggresively than previous
meets, and seemed to be more in focus all through the race.  With
4 weeks to go until the National Qualifying Meet, MIT has some
definite work to do to run their best race.  &quot;I think the
team will realize their goals when the time comes, says Coach
Taylor, I just hope they realize that they want it badly enough
to make it happen.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> The next meet will be on Friday the 18th at Franklin
Park for the NEIAAA Championships, which features all of the colleges
in New England for Divisions I, II, and III.  This is typically
a good test to see how well the team would place at the Division
III Nationals.</FONT>
