<FONT SIZE=4>This past Saturday, the MIT Men's Cross Country Team
competed in the New England Division III Championship / NCAA Division
III National Qualifier at Westfield State.  The weather was wet,
muddy, and in many ways perfect for Cross Country.  The team finished
7th out of 38 schools.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The Engineers got out well at the start (top 40)
and looked in control at the first mile, coming through in 5:01
and 5:02.  At mile two, Mike Parkins '99 had opened up a lead
on the rest of the Engineers by 9 seconds.  It was apparent that
Mike was trying to move up in the top group, but having missed
about 70% of the work in practice due to an injury, he was having
to work too hard to accomplish this task.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The plan for the team had been to get out at the
start (top 40) and gradually move up as a group of 6 until 2.25
miles.  At that point Arnold Seto 'G, if feeling capable was going
to take advantage of his downhill running skills and make a move
to the front.  The others were to stay together until 3 miles,
and then if they felt good and communicated well, they could move
ahead of the group.  Well, things were going well up to mile 2,
but after that the group separated.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>At mile 3, Parkins' 9 second gap on the next 5 MIT
runners became gaps of 9, 11, 15, 18, and 23 seconds.  By four
miles it was apparent that Williams and Tufts had the two spots
for Nationals sewed up.  It seemed to be a very close battle for
3rd through 8th place.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>MIT did not move up in the last mile, and in fact
lost some ground.  Because Tech maintained their 23 second gap
for the top 5, and placed Mike Parkins in 28th, Arnold Seto in
32nd, Dan Helgesen '97 in 40th, Josh Feldman '97 in 43rd, and
Chris McGuire in 45th, it appeared that the team would place in
the top 5.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Too many teams had individuals in the top 10.  Even
though their teams were not so well packed, they scored lower
than MIT.  The difference between 3rd through 7th was only 46
points.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The hope is that the region will do well at Nationals
and earn a 3rd team for Nationals next year.  Even so, the region
is so strong right now that a team could be ranked well in the
top 20 and still not be one of the top 3 teams, thus staying home.
