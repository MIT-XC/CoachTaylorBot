    MEN'S AND WOMEN'S CROSS COUNTRY OPEN WITH  VICTORIES
    
    
                  
    
    September 1, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    Due to the closing of their home course, Franklin Park, for renovations, Tech had to move their Alumni/ae Meet or cancel it for 2012. The decision was made to move it to Keene State College, who were also hosting an Alumni/ae Meet. Other colleges joining in the fray were UMass Lowell, Assumption, Fitchburg State, UMass Dartmouth, Clark, Norwich and Eastern Connecticut State University. The predicted temperature in the 70's turned out to be upper 80's and very humid, and of course, sunny.
    
    
                  
    
    The women ran first. The Engineer's Alumnae team was represented by Tania Morimoto '12 and Jacqui Wentz '10. The varsity raced 21 of the 28 members. Both Elaine McVay '15 and Claire O'Connell '14 were sick with colds.  Stephanie Marzen '15, Kelsey Jamieson '16, Katie Ellinger '16 and Oliva Papa '14 were returning from injuries and not quite ready to race and Sarah Quinn '16 was given the weekend off from racing.
    
    
                  
    
    Given that the race was only for two miles, Tech new they would have to get out quickly to make sure they kept everyone in sight on the twisting and turning course. At the mile mark, Alexandra Taylor '14, Brooke Johnson '13, Nicole Zeinstra '16 and Dacie Manion '15 were in a nice tight pack in fourth through seventh place, trailing Jeptui Cherutich from AIC as well as Morimoto and Wentz. 13 seconds back of their teammates in 10th-14th place, Allison Hallock '16 led her group of Martina de Geus '14, Heather Sweeney '16 and Kaitlin Allen '14.
    
    
                  
    
    During the second mile, Taylor made a great move, running the second mile seven seconds faster than the first mile to catch up the Cherutich and then proceed to outkick her to the line in 11:29. Johnson lost focus for a while, falling back a bit, but finally waking up and moving up to fourth behind Cherutich and Wentz. Zeinstra was only two seconds behind Johnson and Manion three more seconds back. Morimoto was next and Hallock closed out the scoring in 11:52, giving MIT the victory with 19 seconds and a delta of :23.
    
    
                  
    
    The men also earned the victory, outscoring the Keene State Alumni by a score of 27 to 38. The MIT Alumni, represented by Stephen Serene '12 (14th), Eric Khatchadourian '06 (26th), Matt Bieniosek '09 (45th), Ethan Crain '96 (56th), Fivos Constantinou '06 (58th), Paul Welle '11 (82nd), Richard Prevost '11 (83rd), Jack Bourbonnais '10 (97th), Bob Collins '82,  and Tom Hansen '74 (142nd), placed fifth out of the 11 teams with 145 points.
    
    
                  
    
    At the mile mark, Logan Trimble '13 led the way for MIT, running in fourth place in 5:04, while Roy Wedge '14, Benji Xie '15 and Edgar Gridello '16 were in seventh, ninth and 10th back at 5:06. MIT's second group, not exactly running together were Allen Leung '15, Matt Jordan '15, Ben Mattocks 'G, Justin Bullock '14, Ian Tolan '16, Rick Paez '15 and Patrick Juras '16, all between 5:10-5:14.
    
    
                  
    
    In the second mile, Wedge moved into second at 10:14 with Xie in third one second back. However, the Keene State Alumni, in addition to having a solid lead on first place, also had fifth, sixth and 11th. Trimble fell back to seventh, Gridello was feeling the effects of starting too quickly and Mattocks, Tolan and Jordan were moving on the leaders from 12th, 13th and 14th respectively at 10:29-10:30.
    
    
                  
    
    The final mile showed the MIT strength and determination. Both Wedge and Xie caught and passed the leader, earning the win and runner-up positions in 15:46 and 15:49 respectively. Four Keene State Alumni took the next four places. Tolan ran an excellent third mile, moving up the seventh in 16:16. Trimble was one second back in eighth and Gridello held on to ninth in 16:19 to close out the scoring for Tech. Jordan took 10th and Mattocks 12th as bumpers. MIT had a nice delta of :33 for runners 1-5. However, it will be interesting to see what both the men and women will do at the full distance of 5K and 8K in two weeks at the UMass Dartmouth Invitational.

    WOMEN CLAIM A DISAPPOINTING SIXTH PLACE AT NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
                  
    
    November 17, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    The weekend could not have started better. The women from MIT were ranked number one in the country for the fifth week in succession. At the Coaches' and Athletes' Banquet the night before the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship hosted by Rose Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana, Dacie Manion '15 was awarded the NCAA Elite 89 Award--an award presented at each NCAA Championship to the male and female student-athlete competing at the championship with the highest GPA. Manion, a sophomore in Mechanical Engineering has a perfect 5.0 at MIT.
    
    
                  
    
    Going into the race on Saturday the team appeared more ready and relaxed than any team in memory according to Coach Halston Taylor, the Director and Head Coach of the Men's and Women's Cross Country and Track & Field teams. "I would have bet anything that this team was ready to take care of business." Perhaps they were ready, but maybe the little nagging injuries that showed up at the end of the season were not so little.
    
    
                  
    
    Deciding not to run Manion due to a shin injury and holding out alternate Kali Benavides '15, the competing team was comprised of Kaitlin Allen '14, Martina de Geus '14, Brooke Johnson '13, Elaine McVay '15, Sarah Quinn '16, Alexandra Taylor '14 and Nicole Zeinstra '16. Johnson, Quinn and Zeinstra, all suffering through injuries that appeared to be minor, all claimed to be ready to go.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT, placed in box 37, had a great start, not out front, but in a good place to pace evenly and move up through the field. At the mile mark, Group A (Johnson, McVay, Quinn) was together at 5:44, perhaps a little fast given the hills and soft ground, but the position was solid, well back from the leaders, but still within easy striking distance of the main pack. Group B was spread out a bit. Zeinstra and Taylor were at 5:44, too fast for the soft conditions, while de Geus was back at a reasonable 5:47. The normally rock solid Allen, suffering from some situation that had her unable to see, was back at 5:54.
    
    
                  
    
    Group A did a great job of moving up as planned in the second mile, posting a 11:23, although maybe a little sooner than necessary, putting them in the top 30. Group B was spreading out even more, but Zeinstra and Taylor were hanging tough at 11:35, in great position within the top 60. de Geus faded back to 11:43 instead of moving up to assist and Allen continued to have problems at 11:58. At this point MIT was in a very close second place.
    
    
                  
    
    The third mile was the beginning of the end for Tech. Johnson, ignoring her foot pain, and McVay continued to work well together but stopped moving up, and in fact, started losing a few places with their 5:58 split. Quinn's hamstring started bothering her, forcing her to slow to a 6:16 mile. Zeinstra's ailing calf, became too painful, forcing her to drop out. Taylor hit the wall, lost focus and slowed to a 6:53 mile. de Geus was the most steady at 6:14, but also lost ground. Allen remained in the race but was only able to manage a 6:25. 
    
    
                  
    
    In the final .73, Johnson fought hard to earn All America honors (top 35), but still missed it by one, placing 36th in 21:59. McVay finished in 38th at 22:04. Quinn, fading almost the exact amount as the week before when she finished sixth for the team and 31st overall, finished in 74th place at 22:34. de Geus was MIT's fourth finisher at 22:43 in 94th place. Allen closed out the scoring for MIT in 184th place at 23:20. Taylor was 234th in 23:51.
    
    
                  
    
    If MIT had maintained the same top five delta they had boasted all season at sub :30 seconds, even with the less than perfect races by Johnson, McVay and Quinn, they still would have won the meet.
    
    
                  
    
    It was a great season, the best in MIT cross country history, but the coach and team were unable to finish. The fifth consecutive NCAA top 10 finish and fourth in the top six, brings a unique, if perhaps unfair, level of expectation each year, one where anything short of the podium (top four teams) or of winning the team title in this particular case, is a little disappointing.
    
    
                  
    
    Fortunately, with only Johnson graduating from the very deep top 10 performers and what appears to be a very strong recruiting class, the hopes of a national title in the near future remain very high.

    WOMEN WIN NEW ENGLAND REGION - ADVANCE TO NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
                  
    
    November 10, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    The lady harriers from MIT entered the NCAA Division III New England Regional Cross Country Championship as the number one team in the country and did not disappoint, claiming the victory among 51 complete teams at Stanley Park, hosted by Westfield State University.
    
    
                  
    
    On a sunny, 60 degree day, all eligible Division III teams in New England toed the line to vie for a shot at advancing to the NCAA Division III Cross Country Nationals next Saturday, November 17. The top two teams in each of the eight regions would automatically qualify. Another 16 teams would be selected at-large by the NCAA committee. 
    
    
                  
    
    The start of the 6K race was a bit precarious with permanent soccer goals (no nets) presenting obstacles en route to a sharp right turn ~300 meters out, right in the middle of starting arc, meaning all the teams to the right had to sprint to the left side of the field and pray they did not get trapped on the inside of the turn.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT was a little to the right of the arc in slot 39 of 51. The Engineers got out to a great start, managing the field and the turn without error. Tech took their time, moving up through the field without much effort. By the mile mark the lead group for MIT, consisting of Elaine McVay '15, Brooke Johnson '13 and Sarah Quinn '16, hit the mile in 5:38, sitting in 3-4-5 and looking very strong. The B group of Nicole Zeinstra '16, Kaitlin Allen '14, Martina de Geus '14 and Alexandra Taylor '14 hit the mile at 5:47 and were already in the top 20.
    
    
                  
    
    As they entered the woods, MIT continued to push the pace through the hilly part of the course. Between the two and three mile mark the Engineers were in a dominating position, having five runners in the top 12 positions. McVay, Johnson and Quinn hit the two mile at 11:34 while the B group were at 11:50. In the hilly third mile, Quinn's hamstring began to bother her and she started to slow. However, Zeinstra, Allen and de Geus moved up well.
    
    
                  
    
    In the final .72, McVay moved to earned fifth place in 21:43, Johnson was eighth in 21:48, Zeinstra 10th in 22:00, Allen 12th in 22:04 and de Geus 23rd in 22:13. Quinn tried, but her ailing hamstring forced her to fall back to 31st in 22:21. Taylor completed the team in 45th at 22:42. MIT took the title without the scoring benefit of one of their top runners, totaling 58 points to second place Williams College with 75 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The men from MIT did not fair quite as well. At the start the team was almost to the end of the arc in 49th position. To make matters worse, it was not clear the gun had been fired as the sound was not very loud. Half of the MIT contingent got caught standing still at the start and could not get into a good position at the end of the straight.
    
    
                  
    
    Although both the A group for MIT (Roy Wedge '14, Justin Bullock '14, Ben Mattocks '13, Benji Xie '15) and the B group (Ian Tolan '16, Edgar Gridello "16, Allen Leung '15) hit the mile mark in a very respectable 4:55 and 4:59 respectively, they were very far back in the field. In the following short loop in the woods there was not adequate room to pass, forcing them to come to a near halt, losing their momentum and rhythm.
    
    
                  
    
    By the two mile mark they were back in 70-90th positions between 10:21 and 10:29, about 20 to 30 seconds slower than the race plan asked for. Had they continued on pace they would have been right with the leaders of the race.
    
    
                  
    
    In the third and fourth mile Bullock and Wedge made strong moves getting up to the top 30. Bullock fell off after the fourth mile, but still managed to hold on for 45th place in 25:55. Wedge moved up to 27th place, good enough for All Region honors in 25:29. The tight delta MIT had maintained all year disappeared after Mattocks clocked a 26:03 for 52nd place. Tolan was 52 seconds off of Wedge, finishing in 66th place. Xie placed 73rd in 26:30 to close out MIT's scoring, good for ninth place among the 50 teams with 263 points. Gridello was close behind in 75th, also running 26:30 and Leung closed things out for MIT in 82nd in 26:42.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's team will fly out to Terre Haute, Indiana on Thursday and hope to improve on last year's fifth place finish. In the past four years the women's team has had four top 10 finishes at the NCAA Championship, finishing 10th in 2008, fifth in 2009, third in 2010 and the fifth in 2011.

    WOMEN TOP DIVISION III TEAM, FIFTH OVERALL IN NEICAAA CHAMPIONSHIP
    
    
                  
    
    October 7, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    For as long as anyone can remember, the All New England Championship (NEICAAA), which pits the best college teams in all NCAA divisions (I, II and III) against each other, has always been run at Franklin Park, MIT's home course. This year, the park is undergoing renovation, so the race was moved to Stanley Park in Westfield, MA. Since there were already races scheduled for the Saturday, the NEICAAA Championship was moved to Sunday.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's women's team was primarily focused on racing a conservative plan, and of course placing as high as possible amongst the Division I teams. A little dessert would be to defeat Division III, number one ranked Williams College, who had beat MIT two weeks earlier by five points.
    
    
                  
    
    Thirty-seven teams toed the line. While MIT wanted a well paced race, the first turn was 90 degrees and within a quarter mile of the start. After a half-mile the path narrowed to about 8-10 feet in width with very bad footing on large rocks and roots the entire course until the final 700 or so meters on the fields. So, getting out conservatively was a risk in that passing the runners could be a problem.
    
    
                  
    
    Exercising caution, Sarah Quinn '16, Elaine McVay '15 and Brooke Johnson '13, led their teammates through the start, hitting the correct pace, with one problem. The second group, which included Kaitlin Allen '14, Nicole Zeinstra '16, Martina de Geus '14 and Dacie Manion '15, had to stop as they approached the first turn, as many of the runners in front of them had fallen and backed everyone up. The group recovered, but it took some time. Quinn lost her discipline and attacked a little too early, coming through the mile in 5:34, having moved up to 28th place. McVay followed four places behind in the same time as did Johnson. The second group made up for their stall at the start, moving up, but still in 140th place at 5:59. Their patience paid off as a 6:01 second mile moved them up all the way to 65th-71st place. Quinn broke from her group, moving all the way to ninth with a 5:52 second mile. McVay moved up to 16th despite a 6:00 mile. Johnson, suffering from low serum ferritin, felt the effects of the fast pace, falling back to 6:10 pace. The second group continued to move up, passing about half the remaining field to move into the top 70. The final mile was difficult for Quinn as she started to pay for her fast first mile. Nevertheless she showed her mettle as she fought to a 5:50 third mile even though she fell back to 17th place at the end with a 17:50 5K. Quinn was the top Division III runner in the meet as well as the second freshman finisher, although three of the top DIII runners in New England were absent from the meet. McVay rallied with a strong finish to place 19th in 17:52. Allen continued her pace, actually running her fastest mile last, moving up to 51st place in 18:25. The other freshman varsity runner, Zeinstra was right behind in 18:28 in 55th place. Johnson held on barely for 56th place, also in 18:28 to close out MIT's scoring. MIT ended with 198 points for fifth place, 50 points ahead of Williams back in eighth.
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's sub-varsity race, Kali Benavides '15 ran an outstanding race, although she too went out a little too fast in the first mile. Her 18:21 was good enough for fourth place in the sub-varsity race, leading her team to second place, three points behind Williams, as Division III showed superior depth amongst the New England schools. Also scoring for MIT were Alexandra Taylor '14 in 12th place, running 18:38, Allison Hallock '16, placing 16th in 18:48, Marie Burkland '13, placing 21st in 18:57 and Cindy Huang '15, finishing in 22nd in 18:59. MIT had a pretty decent delta of :58 for the top 10 and :42 for the top seven. A total of 12 runners were under 19:00 on a fairly difficult course.
    
    
                  
    
    The men's team was hoping to show their true talent and race among the top teams in Division III. There is no question the talent is there and also no question the team was really ready to compete. However, the excitement was not contained and at the end of the first 400 meters, as they were about to enter the first turn, right in front of the pack were three of MIT runners. By the mile mark, they had settled back some, but most of the damage was done.  Even after settling down the first mile was still 4:49 for Benji Xie '15, Logan Trimble '13 and Ian Tolan '16, all in the top 30. Three to four seconds back were Ben Mattocks '13, Roy Wedge '14, Allen Leung '15 and Edgar Gridello '16, back around 90th place. In the second mile, which was still on the grass fields for the men's course, Xie and Trimble ran 5:19, falling back to ~65th place. The second group stayed up to Xie, passing many runners, with only Leung a little behind, but all ran around 5:23 for the second mile. Once they hit the woods  and uneven footing, only Xie and Mattocks moved up, with Xie finishing in 59th place in 25:30 and Mattocks one second back in 62nd place. After a large gap, Leung finished in 94th in 25:53. Gridello ran 25:58 in 99th position and Tolan was right behind in 100th in 25:59. Wedge was running a strong race, but fell and never fully recovered mentally from the spill. The varsity effort netted them a 13th place overall and fourth among Division III teams, although two strong Division III teams were not in attendance.
    
    
                  
    
    In the sub-varsity race, Matt Jordan, also going out way too fast, ran a relatively strong race, finishing in 14th in 26:01. The sub-varsity team finished in eighth with 202 points. Supporting Jordan was Justin Bullock '14, running 26:36 for 38th, despite a sore back, Rick Paez '15, running 26:38 for 41st place, Jay McKenna '14, running 26:54 for 57th place and Eric Safai '14, running 27:15 for 85th place.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT will be off from competition for three weeks, not competing until the NEWMAC Conference Championship on October 27th at Smith College. The women have won the past five years while the men have never lost the championship, racking up 14 straight victories.

    CROSS COUNTRY DEFENDS NEWMAC TITLES, WOMEN GAIN PERFECT SCORE
    
    
                  
    
    October 27, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's Men's and Women's Cross Country teams traveled to Smith College, the host of the 15th annual NEWMAC Cross Country Championship, hoping to defend their titles as champions. The male harriers from MIT had never lost the championship and were now going for their 15th consecutive NEWMAC victory. The women, ranked number one in the country for Division III, were attempting their sixth title in succession.
    
    
                  
    
    The women toed the line first. The goal was not just to win the competition, but also to continue to learn patience and run their own race. There was also a need to decide on who the top seven would be for the NCAA Division III Regional Championship in two weeks. With 10 of the 26 member team all racing well enough to claim one of the seven spots, the task of selecting those seven would not be easy.
    
    
                  
    
    The course was real cross country with three hills, one in the first 800 meters, another longer hill in the middle of the course and a very steep 50 meter hill ending with 800 meters to go in the 5K race. The weather cooperated, bringing overcast skies and 58 degrees.
    
    
                  
    
    As usual, at the start a number of runners took off, stringing out the 150 runners  right away. Managing the first hill with caution, the pace was pretty slow with the leaders coming through in 3:05. The MIT runners were working their way into the race so the closest runner to the leaders was a solid five seconds back.
    
    
                  
    
    By the mile mark, MIT runners Brooke Johnson '13, Elaine McVay '15 and Sarah Quinn '16 had taken the lead at 6:04, with only three Wellesley, two Smith and one Mt. Holyoke runner strung out behind them. From there the trail group was at least another five seconds back. There were 11 opposing runners in front of Tech's second group of runners (Alexandra Taylor '14, Kaitlin Allen '14, Nicole Zeinstra '16, Dacie Manion '15, Martina de Geus '14, Kali Benavides '15 and Allison Hallock '16) who came through the mile mark in 6:14. 
    
    
                  
    
    MIT continued to negative split the race despite the long hill in the second mile. The front runners ran a 6:02 with Tech's B group running 6:13, putting them 21 seconds behind their front running teammates. However, not only had MIT supporting runners moved past those in their group but had begun to close on all the runners falling off the pace set by the leaders.
    
    
                  
    
    The final mile continued with more of the same. MIT opened up a commanding gap and looked comfortable doing so. At the three mile mark, McVay led Johnson by a second, but Johnson's kick was just enough to take the victory for her first NEWMAC Cross Country title with a time of 18:30 for the NEWMAC Runner of the Year. McVay was second, also in 18:30. Quinn, running with a mildly sprained ankle, was tighter than usual, but still managed third, with Rookie of the Year honors for her 18:37 effort. Sixteen seconds behind Quinn, Taylor emerged as the front runner for the B group, claiming fourth in the race in 18:53. Allen closed out the MIT scoring and sweep in 18:55. MIT was not finished yet as they claimed the top eight places. In sixth was Zeinstra in 18:57, seventh was Manion in 18:59 and de Geus finished in eighth with a time of 19:04. Also earning All NEWMAC honors was Benavides in 19:09, good for 12th place.
    
    
                  
    
    The 29 second delta for MIT's top seven was just what they were looking for. Twelve Engineers were within a minute of Johnson, saying a lot of their depth and youth, with only Johnson being a senior.
    
    
                  
    
    The men knew they would have a much more difficult race as Springfield College had been close to them in three previous races this year. The pressure was on the Engineers to continue the victory streak. The men knew they had not run a race this year that represents their ability, and that with this one race to go prior to Regionals, it was time to get their act together.
    
    
                  
    
    Springfield College took the race out, but not too fast. Most runners were respecting the course as the men's version was much more hilly than the women's, with two additional large hills, one at 1.5 and one at 2.5 miles. For once, Tech stayed in their groups and exercised patience. Springfield had the two leaders and five of the first nine runners at the mile mark. Three MIT runners were mixed in the back of that group, Roy Wedge '14, Logan Trimble '13 and Benji Xie '15 came through the mile in 5:17. MIT's depth was starting to show as the second group, led by Ben Mattocks 'G, was right behind in 5:20-5:22. In that second group were Allen Leung '15, Ian Tolan '16, Edgar Gridello '16 and Matthew Jordan '15.
    
    
                  
    
    At the second mile, MIT had taken over the team competition, having four of the top 10 runners as well as runners 13-16, with Justin Bullock '14 joining the group with an excellent 5:24 mile. The third mile continued to see MIT move up, although Springfield continued to have the top two runners. Wedge and Xie were now in third and fourth respectively, hitting the split in 15:40. Supporting them was Mattocks in eighth, Bullock in ninth, Leung in 11th, Trimble in 12th and Gridello in 13th.
    
    
                  
    
    Wedge hit the four mile split in 20:58, moving into second place. Wedge's fourth mile push was too much for Xie, who slipped badly to 21:10. Mattocks had moved up to Xie with Bullock and Leung right behind.
    
    
                  
    
    At the finish, Wedge faded to fourth behind Salvucci and O'Connell from Springfield and Ezzo of Coast Guard. Wedge finished in a very respectable 26:02 and was followed in fifth place by Mattocks in 26:08. Bullock ran the best cross country race of his life, finishing seventh in 26:21. Leung was eighth in 26:22, Tolan came back out of nowhere to claim Rookie of the Year honors for his ninth place finish in 26:28, less than a second ahead of fellow freshman, Gridello in 10th and Jordan was 11th in 26:29, giving MIT seven runners within 27 seconds and ahead of Springfield's third runner. Xie and Trimble faded a bit but were still All Conference at 13th and 14th in 26:30 and 26:31 respectively. Tech's 33 points gave them their victory to continue the streak.
    
    
                  
    
    In two weeks, MIT will vie for the New England Regional Championship and a trip to the NCAA Division III Championship. Westfield State College will host the meet at Stanley Park with the men racing at 11:00 and the women going at 12:00.

    #1 RANKED WOMEN FINISH SECOND IN PURPLE VALLEY CLASSIC
    
    
                  
    
    September 22, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    Five days after receiving the #1 ranking in Division III Cross Country by the college coaches in America, MIT's women lost to last week's #2 team, Williams, while defeating 13 others, including last week's #1 team, Middlebury. The end result on the hilly 6K course at the Purple Valley Classic, had Williams with 78 points, MIT 83 and Middlebury 87. The next closest team in the 15 team field was Oberlin College with 121 points. 
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's men never really got in the race, but ran a smart pace, allowing them to place relatively high. The highest place finisher for Tech in the 17 team field was Logan Trimble '13, who finished 16th in 26:56, 43 seconds behind the leader. The very challenging course took its toll, but the smart pacing by the Engineers allowed them to place fifth with 137 points and a 44 second delta through five runners.
    
    
                  
    
    The men raced first. The controlled pace by the Engineers put them in good position at the 1/2 mile mark, but by the mile mark they had already fallen off the pace, ranging in pace from 5:15-5:32. A 5:10 first mile would have been more appropriate for the top runners. The second mile, which has a very difficult hill, was run well by Tech. Benji Xie '15, MIT's top man at that point in the race, came through the two mile in 10:40, putting him in excellent position among the top runners. Trimble was only three seconds back, but then the next closest MIT runner was Ben Mattocks '13 at 10:50. The third mile, a flat mile, was a good one for Xie and Trimble, along with Allen Leung '15 and Edgar Gridello '16, all of whom ran 5:20 or better. The fourth mile was a repeat of the big hill and what everyone had saved up for. Xie dropped out at the three mile mark due to a glute problem, but all but three of MIT's runners put in a solid 5:15-5:32 mile. Other than the fact that the overall pace was too slow by MIT, the only other issue was the fact that the fifth mile, overall a downhill mile, was horribly slow (5:25-5:57) relative to their competitors. After Trimble, freshman Gridello was 26th in 27:07, Mattocks placed 29th in 27:16, Leung was 27:21 in 32nd place and Ian Tolan '16, running with a cold, placed 39th in 27:40. Roy Wedge '14, Tech's top runner had been out with an illness for the past seven days. This combined with Xie not finishing certainly made a difference in MIT's competitiveness.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were next, and despite the fact they were missing three of their top 10 runners, they were confident they could win the meet. MIT set themselves up for defeat in the first half mile as they went out at 2:52-3:02, which was about 5-10 seconds too fast per group given the difficulty of the course. By the time they were going up the slight hill towards the mile mark, they were already slowing down. So instead of entering mile two running 5:55-6:20 pace, they were actually now running 6:00-6:30 pace even though their mile time was faster than that. The second mile was also pretty flat so maintaining the pace would not have been a problem had they paced better. Freshman Sarah Quinn and Brooke Johnson '13 were about 10 seconds behind the leader at the two mile mark, but looking strong at 11:50 running in fourth and fifth place. Falling off the pace was Elaine McVay '15 in 12:06. After another 10 second gap, Tech had three more runners, Alexandra Taylor '14 in 12:14, Martina de Geus '14 in 12:15, and Kaitlin Allen '14 in 12:16. On the women's course, the hill was in the third mile. Quinn handled it pretty well, keeping her position, but slowing to a 6:11 mile. The rest of the Engineers suffered, paying for that fast first 1/2 mile. Johnson fell back three places, McVay and de Geus lost numerous places. Williams and Middlebury moved up on MIT considerably in the final mile. MIT reclaimed some places in the final 3/4 of a mile once they hit the field, but not enough to catch Williams. Quinn ended up fourth in 22:30, an excellent time and the best ever by an MIT runner on the 6K course. Johnson finished in eighth place in 22:49. McVay placed 14th in 22:59, Allen in 25th in 23:22 and de Geus in 32nd in 23:35 to close out MIT's scoring. The :55 second delta was far too much for a top ranked team and ultimately was the reason for the loss.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT will have next weekend off, but in two weeks, they will get another chance at both schools along with all the Division I teams in New England in the All New England Championship on Sunday, October 7. Hopefully all the ailing runners will return to top form for the Engineers.

    CROSS COUNTRY DEFENDS UMASS DARTMOUTH TITLES
    
    
                  
    
    September 15, 2012
    
    
                  
    
    MIT was one of 39 colleges competing in the UMass Dartmouth Invitational on Saturday. The Engineers were there to defend their four titles from 2011; men's varsity and sub-varsity races and the women's varsity and sub-varsity races. The Engineers were not able to field a full team in the men's sub-varsity race as a few individuals were out with severe colds. However, the four individuals who did race for MIT claimed the top four spots. In the other three races, MIT prevailed to remain undefeated.
    
    
                  
    
    The course is as flat as any cross country course can be. The grass was thick and holding water from an early rain, but still relatively fast so it was expected that times would be pretty quick despite the 70 degree temperature. 
    
    
                  
    
    The men's sub-varsity ran first. Justin Bullock '14, Rick Paez '15, Eric Safai '14 and Jay McKenna '14 represented MIT, coming through the mile mark in a conservative 5:17. By the two mile mark it was clear they were moving up on the competition despite a very slow 5:34 second mile. During the third mile it became apparent the quartet had been holding back for the first two miles as they jumped the pace to 5:09-5:12 on the uphill mile. Coming down the hill in the fourth mile, Bullock threw in a 4:56 mile to drop his teammates and most of the field with the exception of one unattached runner. In the final mile, MIT runners continued to move up, eventually taking the top four scoring spots. Bullock took the win in an excellent 25:51. Paez ran 26:17, Safai 26:26 and McKenna 26:37.
    
    
                  
    
    When the men's varsity took the line the rain had stopped. Number one runner, Roy Wedge '14, would not be racing, but for the most part the top seven was intact. This race proved to be quite competitive as MIT won with 63 points, with Springfield  close with 104. However, a healthy Roy Wedge would have cut at least 20 points off of MIT's score. Tech's entire pack was together at the mile and in great position at 5:06. In the second mile, Logan Trimble '13, had made a strong move with a 5:07 to move into the top four, while his teammates were back in 5:17. Allen Leung '15, rolled his ankle and lost 24 seconds getting it to the point where he could run again. Matt Jordan '15, also suffering from a cold, was not able to race his best, dropping to 5:25. In the uphill third mile, Trimble threw down a 4:57 as the lead group continued to separate themselves from the rest of the pack. The rest of MIT ran a very competitive 5:05-5:09 to move up well in the pack. Edgar Gridello '16, running very well as a freshman, got cramps in his quad and had to drop out. In the downhill fourth mile, Trimble continued to battle with the leaders, but the group stayed intact despite the 4:43 split. The rest of the MIT group split up as Benji Xie '15 ran 4:49, Ben Mattocks '13 ran 4:52, and Ian Tolan '16 ran 4:54 along with Leung. In the final mile Trimble took it down to the final 100 meters before he was outkicked, settling for third place in a very impressive 24:45. Xie finished in eighth in 25:11. Mattocks was not far behind in 14th in 25:24. Tolan placed 17th in 25:35 after suffering through a side stitch. Leung closed out the scoring for Tech, finishing in 25th in 25:55. Leung ran 15:08 for the final three miles after twisting his ankle, a very inspirational performance. The one disappointment for MIT was a delta of 1:10 for their top five, particularly on a flat course. They hope to lower that delta next week to under 45 seconds.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT, the fifth ranked team nationally, wanted to race together and show their depth, and was certainly on the way to doing that as they were in total control of the race, just off the lead at the mile mark in 5:41 while their second group was back at 5:50. However, in the second mile, which is a loop through a heavily wooded area that the lead vehicle did not go into, the lead runner went off course and all of MIT's runners went with her. After 70 meters or so, the mistake was realized and Tech's runners reversed their course to get back on the loop. However, at this point they were now in back of nearly 300 runners. Not knowing how far the leaders were ahead, Brooke Johnson '13, Sarah Quinn '16 and Elaine McVay '15 led the way for the Engineers to work their way through the immense pack of runners on a very tight loop in the woods. Somehow, by the two mile mark, MIT was back in front with Quinn leading the way and Martina de Geus '14 along with Johnson and McVay right behind. Four runners back of McVay was Dacie Manion '15 and Allison Hallock '16. In the final mile, Johnson caught Quinn, outkicking her to finish off a 5:38 final mile for a total time of 18:25 to defend her title from last year. Quinn was second in 18:30, McVay third in 18:34, de Geus fourth in 18:37 and Manion seventh in 18:44 to give MIT a score of 17 points. All MIT runners had to have lost at least 20 seconds on the error and quite a bit more on having to fight and weave through the entire field of runners with half the race already run. Nicole Zeinstra '16, one of the top five runners for MIT had to drop out with a hamstring injury.
    
    
                  
    
    The final race of the day, the women's sub-varsity had 13 runners entered for MIT. Tech's lead group got out well and led by Kaitlin Allen '14 came through the mile in 5:55. The second group was within reach at 6:03. By the two mile mark, MIT, as a team had pulled away from the opposing runners  with Allen well out in front in 11:58. Kali Benavides '15 was back in third at 12:18. Marie Burkland was in fifth at 12:21, Louise van den Heuvel '14 in seventh at 12:26 and Elena de la Paz '16 in eighth at 12:27. Allen did not let up in the third mile, running a 5:45 to finish the 5K in 18:16, winning by 27 seconds. Benavides was third in 18:57, Burkland fourth in 19:02, de la Paz seventh in 19:12, van den Heuvel eighth in 19:18, Marissa Stephens '16 ninth in 19:21, Shivani Kaushal '15 10th in 19:22, Frankie Perone '16 11th in 19:22, Heather Sweeney '16 12th in 19:29, Margaret Coad '15 14th in 19:39, Cindy Huang '15 in 19:50, Veronica Montgomery '16 17th in 19:59 and Natasha Gunther '16 18th in 20:01. Only five total runners broke up MIT's team among the 215 finishers.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week will not be so dominating as the Engineers go up against some of the best teams in the region and country. For the women, the #1, 2 and 6 teams will be going up against the 5th ranked Engineers. On the men's side there will be many top ranked teams as well. This will provide MIT with a sense of what they have to do to contend for the regional title in two months.
