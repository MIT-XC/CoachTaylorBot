<P><FONT SIZE="+1">On Saturday, MIT Men's Cross Country Team, played
host to nationally ranked Tufts (8th), and Bates (24th) at Franklin
Park. On a warm, but dry and breezy day, MIT's harriers ran their
plan, patiently worked their way through the opposing team's runners,
and ended up winning in the last mile of the five mile race by a
score of 35 to 42 for Tufts, and 48 to Bates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The race began with eventual winner, Michael
Danahy from Bates, Matt Lyons from Tufts, and Mark Strauss '01, Mike
Parkins '99, and Dan Feldman '02, from MIT, leading the way through a
fast but controlled 5:00 first mile. Both Tufts and Bates had over 10
runners each in front of MIT's next runners, who came through in
5:15.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">By the second mile mark, the same 5 were leading
the way, with a wide gap separating them from the rest of the runners
who were packed in small groups. MIT's 4-7 runners were still behind
at least eight Tuft's runners, but had closed the gap
somewhat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The third mile, which is partly run through the
"wilderness loop", was where MIT made up the most ground. They had
already reeled in most of the Bate's runners, and had the Tuft's
runners in sight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">By the time they came out of the wilderness for
the second time, enroute to the 4th mile mark, Ed Keehr '01, and
Frank Johnston '00 had completely closed the gap on Tuft's 3-6
runners. Ed then ran a fantastic last mile, catching all four Tuft's
runners to lead MIT to victory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Danahy, who had fallen behind Strauss during the
4th mile, had a furious charge in the last half-mile. He opened up a
small gap on Strauss and held on for a 2 second victory in 25:29.
Parkins was nine seconds behind and was followed by Lyons and
Patterson from Tufts. Feldman held on for 6th place. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Showing their depth, MIT place 13 runners ahead of
Tuft's 9th runner and Bates 10 runner. Next week, MIT is again at
Franklin Park for the annual Codfish Bowl, hosted by UMass/Boston.
