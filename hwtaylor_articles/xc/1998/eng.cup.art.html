VICTORY</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Men's Cross Country Team took on RPI and WPI
in the annual Engineer's Cup in a home meet at Franklin Park this
past Saturday. With a strong team returning from last year, MIT
expected an easy victory over the other Tech schools, and that is
what they got, with a low score of 22 points to 39 for RPI and 76 for
WPI.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">MIT lead runners Mark Strauss '01, Mike Parkins
'99, and Dan Feldman '02 took the first mile out in 4:55 to open up a
7 second lead, and that is as close as it ever got. Strauss took a
wrong turn in the last mile, disqualifying him from the race and a
near certain first place finish. A second group of MIT runners
consisting of Frank Johnston '00, Ed Keehr '01, and Leif Seed '99,
tried to break the top two RPI runners in hopes of running to a
perfect score of 15 points, but were unable to put them
away.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The RPI runners, who appeared broken after the 1st
mile, were coming back. After the half-way point, one was catching up
to Frank and Leif, and another was running right on Ed. By 3 1/2
miles 1 RPI runner had overtaken Leif and was moving on Frank. Three
more Rensselaer harriers had moved past Ed and were about to overtake
Leif. The third MIT group of Liyan Guo '01, Ray Molnar '00, and Jeff
Billing '01, as well as Phil Loiselle '01, who had fallen back from
the second group, were making a strong run at the RPI group trailing
Leif.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">A constant pace allowed the top two RPI runners to
pass Frank in the last mile and earn 3th and 4th places. A strong
last mile and a half by Ed caught 2 of the 4 RPI runners and place
him just behind Frank for 6th place. Leif and Liyan had fine kicks to
pass the 4th RPI runner to garner 8th and 9th places to round out
MIT's top 6. </FONT></P>

and Tufts at Franklin Park. Tufts is ranked in the top 10 in the
country.</FONT></P>
