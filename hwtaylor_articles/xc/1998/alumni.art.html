MEET</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">On a near perfect Fall-like day, the Men's Varsity
Cross Country Team ran strong up front to outlast a good Alumni Team
25-32. Nine Alumni started and finished the 5 mile race at Franklin
Park. Leading the way, was former two-time All-American, Jesse Darley
'95. Jesse led from start to finish, pulling away in the final mile
with an excellent time of 25:47.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Varsity went out strong. Seven varsity runners
and three alumni runners came through the first mile in 5:06. By the
two mile mark, the lead group had thinned to four runners, Jesse, and
varsity members Mike Parkins '99, Dan Feldman '02, and Mark Strauss
'01, as they came through in 10:29. Alumni runners, Arnold Seto '96,
Terry McNatt '86, and ultra-marathoner, Jim Garcia '80, followed
closely along with varsity runners Frank Johnston '00, Jack Favilukis
'02, and Leif Seed '99.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It was apparent that unless the Alumni were to
move up and take three of the top five places, they would not have
the depth to pull out the victory. The top Varsity runners were not
to be overtaken as they ran the 3rd and 4th miles in 5:13 and 5:20 to
expand their lead over the other runners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The final mile saw leads expand but not change as
the runners ran hard to the finish. Following Jesse were Parkins,
Feldman, and Strauss. Seto and McNatt were next for the Alumni to
make it 9-12 through three runners, in favor of the Varsity. Johnston
beat Garcia to the finish to expand the lead by one point. Favilukis
finished the scoring for the Varsity as he beat Josh Feldman '96, to
the line by three places to secure the victory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Strong performances were also turned in by Phil
Loiselle '01, and Ed Keehr '01. Additional Alumni in the race were
Omar Saleh '97, Dev Sinha '94, Mike Mollod '86, and Chuck Van Buren
'98.</FONT></P>

hosting the Engineer's Cup against RPI and WPI at 2:45.</FONT></P>
