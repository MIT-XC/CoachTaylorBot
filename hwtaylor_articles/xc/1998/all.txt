    MEET**
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    On a near perfect Fall-like day, the Men's Varsity
    Cross Country Team ran strong up front to outlast a good Alumni Team
    25-32. Nine Alumni started and finished the 5 mile race at Franklin
    Park. Leading the way, was former two-time All-American, Jesse Darley
    '95. Jesse led from start to finish, pulling away in the final mile
    with an excellent time of 25:47.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Varsity went out strong. Seven varsity runners
    and three alumni runners came through the first mile in 5:06. By the
    two mile mark, the lead group had thinned to four runners, Jesse, and
    varsity members Mike Parkins '99, Dan Feldman '02, and Mark Strauss
    '01, as they came through in 10:29. Alumni runners, Arnold Seto '96,
    Terry McNatt '86, and ultra-marathoner, Jim Garcia '80, followed
    closely along with varsity runners Frank Johnston '00, Jack Favilukis
    '02, and Leif Seed '99.
    
    
    
    
    
    It was apparent that unless the Alumni were to
    move up and take three of the top five places, they would not have
    the depth to pull out the victory. The top Varsity runners were not
    to be overtaken as they ran the 3rd and 4th miles in 5:13 and 5:20 to
    expand their lead over the other runners.
    
    
    
    
    
    The final mile saw leads expand but not change as
    the runners ran hard to the finish. Following Jesse were Parkins,
    Feldman, and Strauss. Seto and McNatt were next for the Alumni to
    make it 9-12 through three runners, in favor of the Varsity. Johnston
    beat Garcia to the finish to expand the lead by one point. Favilukis
    finished the scoring for the Varsity as he beat Josh Feldman '96, to
    the line by three places to secure the victory.
    
    
    
    
    
    Strong performances were also turned in by Phil
    Loiselle '01, and Ed Keehr '01. Additional Alumni in the race were
    Omar Saleh '97, Dev Sinha '94, Mike Mollod '86, and Chuck Van Buren
    '98.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Varsity our back at Franklin Park next week
    hosting the Engineer's Cup against RPI and WPI at 2:45.

    **MIT REMAINS UNDEFEATED AFTER BABSON
    INVITATIONAL WIN**
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    Oct. 3, 1998
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT's Men's Cross Country Team ran in and won the
    Babson Invitational on Saturday with a low score of 58 points. Led by
    Captain Mike Parkins '99, and Mark Strauss '01, who finished 1st and
    2nd, the Tech runners beat 26 other teams, including nationally
    ranked Brandeis on this near perfect weather day.
    
    
    
    
    
    Racing on a course other than Franklin Park for
    the first time this season, MIT went out harder than usual so as not
    to get caught on some of the narrow paths throughout the course.
    However, Brandeis was out in front, with Coast Guard also among the
    leaders. By the second mile, the lead group which include Parkins,
    Strauss, and freshman Dan Feldman, had separated from the rest of the
    pack and MIT's second group by 20 seconds.
    
    
    
    
    
    The third mile had the first real hill, a 150
    meter, winding, low grade incline that did little to slow anyone
    down. The lead group was only 6 by the end of the third mile with 1
    Brandeis, 3 MIT, 1 Coast Guard, and 1 Bates runner. MIT was still
    trailing Brandeis but not by much. The fourth mile again had the same
    hill, and again the lead group did not slow down their pace over the
    dusty, winding course. 
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT's 4th runner, Phil Loiselle '01, had moved
    ahead of Brandeis's 4th runner and Ed Keehr '01, was even with their
    5th runner. The strength of Tech's lead group wrapped up the victory
    as Feldman finished in 6th to support Parkins and Strauss. Loiselle
    ended up in 20th with Keehr placing 31st.
    
    
    
    
    
    For the first time this season, the team was
    broken up into Varsity and Sub-varsity sections. MIT was looking
    forward to this opportunity because of their tremendous
    depth.
    
    
    
    
    
    The inexperience at leading a race showed, but the
    results were not affected as MIT finished in 1st with 21 points. Sean
    Montgomery '01, led the way with his 1st place finish. Liyan Guo '01,
    mirrored Parkins and Strauss's 1-2 finish by finishing 2nd in his
    race. Supporting Montgomery and Guo were Jose Esparza '02, in 4th,
    Jeff Billing '01, in 5th, and Ray Molnar '00, in 9th.
    
    
    
    
    
    Overall, MIT had their top 9 runners within 1:50
    of each other. Coach Halston Taylor thinks they can 14 runners within
    2:00, and close the top 5 to within 1:00. MIT's next opportunity to
    work toward this goal will be on October 10th at Dickinson College in
    Pennsylvania to test out the National Championship course in the 2nd
    of two National Preview Invitationals.

    **MIT HAS 21 SEASON BESTS EN ROUTE TO
    CODFISH BOWL VICTORY**
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    SEPTEMBER 26, 1998
    
    
    
    
    
    The Men's Cross Country Team took their undefeated record to
    Franklin Park this weekend to run the 31st Annual Codfish Bowl.
    Running a solid race from front to back, MIT ran past 15 teams with a
    low score of 55 points to take the victory and remain undefeated.
    
    
    
    
    
    The first invitational of the year proved to have a much faster
    start than any of MIT's previous meets. The lead group ran through
    the mile mark in 4:52. Bates and UMass/Lowell seemed to be the front
    runners with both teams having 7 runners ahead of MIT's 4th man,
    although MIT did have 3 runners in the front group (Mark Strauss '01,
    Mike Parkins '99, and Dan Feldman '02).
    
    
    
    
    
    Things did not change much during the more difficult 2nd mile. The
    leaders pack was down to 5 as they came through the 2 mile mark in
    10:11, with Feldman giving close chase. However, MIT, while running
    in nice groups, had not closed much on Bates.
    
    
    
    
    
    The third mile was more in Tech's favor. Strauss and Parkins
    maintained close contact with the leaders as they came through in
    15:20. Feldman fell back by 10 seconds, but no one was catching him.
    A pack of MIT runners (Ed Keehr '01, Phil Loiselle '01, and Frank
    Johnston '00) had broken up Bates main pack and was only 26 seconds
    behind Feldman.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the 4th mile, Robert Mitchell of Amherst broke away from the
    lead pack and Gary Mello of Bentley was close behind. Strauss and
    Parkins were giving chase but not making much headway. Feldman had
    fallen back by 10 more seconds and Keehr, Loiselle, and Johnston had
    maintained their distance while continuing to catch those opponents
    who were fading.
    
    
    
    
    
    Little changed in the final mile except for the amazing charge of
    Sean Montgomery '01. Sean, a half-miler with a great sense of pace,
    and little desire to go out too fast, ran a 4:46 final mile (faster
    than everyone except Strauss) and caught 15 runners. Sean ended up as
    the 7th man in 32nd place with a 26:46. Feldman finished in 10th,
    Keehr in 16th, and Loiselle in 22nd to give MIT the winning score.
    Overall, 21 of 22 runners ran season bests.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT travel to Babson to test the National Qualifying
    course in the Babson Invitational. Last year's number 2 man, Chris
    McGuire hopes to run his first race this week as he continues to
    rehabilitate from a knee injury.

    **MIT CLAIMS 2ND PLACE IN NATIONAL
    PREVIEW**
    
    
    
    **Defeat 10th Ranked Cortland and 13th Ranked Haverford, Lose to
    #5 Williams**
    
    
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    OCTOBER 10, 1998
    
    
    
    
    
    This past Saturday, MIT Men's Cross Country Team travelled to
    Carlisle, Pennsylvania to race in the National Preview Invitational
    hosted by Dickinson College, and to see the site of the National
    Championships.
    
    
    
    
    
    Going into the meet seeded 4th behind nationally ranked teams from
    Williams (5th), SUNY Cortland (10th), and Haverford (13th), the
    undefeated harriers from MIT had something to prove. With strong
    front running from Mark Strauss '01 (2nd), Mike Parkins '99 (4th),
    and Dan Feldman '02 (13th), the Engineers ran past Cortland and
    Haverford, but lost to a very good team from Williams College.
    
    
    
    
    
    The Meet was broken up into two races, a white race and a red
    race. The better teams were supposed to be in the "white race", but
    Cortland elected to put their runners in the race with little
    competition. The "white race" was first. The pace for the 200+
    runners at the start was very fast, particularly for a wet course
    with constantly rolling hills, and many, many turns. At the mile mark
    Williams had already established themselves as the team to beat as
    they had 6 runners in the lead pack at 5:02 along with 3 MIT runners
    and a few runners from the other 28 teams in the race.
    
    
    
    
    
    The second mile had a lot of turns and some mud which worked to
    slow the pace down to 10:16 at the second mile. Williams had begun to
    string out and fall back some, but there were no other teams there to
    take advantage of it. Strauss and Parkins were with a group of 6,
    including 2 Williams' runners, with Feldman 5 seconds back with the
    other Williams runners. The second tier of Tech runners had gotten
    out too far back at the start (around 80th) and had to work really
    hard to move through the pack. This worked to string out the group
    and cause many to begin to suffer early in the race.
    
    
    
    
    
    By mile three, the lead group was down to four, Strauss, Parkins,
    McCue from Williams, and one runner from Plattsburgh as they came
    through in 15:39. Feldman fell back another 5 seconds, but so did the
    other runners. By this time Haverford College had a core of runners
    in about 20th position. Phil Loiselle '01, and Sean Montgomery '01
    had begun to make progress working their way through the pack and had
    moved up to about 35th in 16:20. 
    
    
    
    
    
    The 4th mile had a very long hill at the end of the mile that took
    it's toll on many of the runners, particularly the Haverford runners.
    Loiselle had moved up to about 25th and Montgomery moved past a
    couple of runners. Strauss and McCue had pulled away from Parkins and
    the Plattsburgh runner and began their own private battle.
    
    
    
    
    
    The last mile was predominantly downhill and the sub 5:00 pace
    showed it. McCue pulled away from Strauss in the last 200 meters as
    he won in 25:49 to Strauss's 25:50. Parkins, who had stomach problems
    the entire race, held on for 4th in 26:06. Feldman came through in
    11th with a 26:39, but he was behind 6 runners from Williams.
    Haverford had two runners immediately behind Feldman and a third
    runner 16 seconds back. Loiselle made a strong move in the last mile
    to pass the 4th Haverford runner as he finished his best race to date
    in 27:05. Montgomery finished immediately behind the 5th Haverford
    runner in 27:18.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the "Red Race", Cortland ran all alone for the first two miles
    until the sub-varsity Williams runners began to reel them in by mile
    three. The leadCortland runners, who had come through the 2 mile in
    the same pace as the other race, fell way off the pace in the third
    mile. At the finish the top Cortland runner finished 7th overall with
    a 26:27. Their 2nd runner was 12th, one place ahead of the displaced
    Feldman. The third Cortland runner finished with a time just ahead of
    Loiselle. Their 4th and 5th runners were right behind Phil, but with
    little up front, they could not catch MIT. 
    
    
    
    
    
    The Tech runner with perhaps the best race of the day was Reid
    Andersen '01, who followed his plan to perfection. Reid finished 10th
    overall for MIT , which is quite an improvement from his 15th place
    average. Reid also was the only Tech runner with a personal best time
    of 28:42, coming on a less than ideal course. 
    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    **MIT MEN'S XC ENGINEERS
    VICTORY**
    
    
    
    The Men's Cross Country Team took on RPI and WPI
    in the annual Engineer's Cup in a home meet at Franklin Park this
    past Saturday. With a strong team returning from last year, MIT
    expected an easy victory over the other Tech schools, and that is
    what they got, with a low score of 22 points to 39 for RPI and 76 for
    WPI.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT lead runners Mark Strauss '01, Mike Parkins
    '99, and Dan Feldman '02 took the first mile out in 4:55 to open up a
    7 second lead, and that is as close as it ever got. Strauss took a
    wrong turn in the last mile, disqualifying him from the race and a
    near certain first place finish. A second group of MIT runners
    consisting of Frank Johnston '00, Ed Keehr '01, and Leif Seed '99,
    tried to break the top two RPI runners in hopes of running to a
    perfect score of 15 points, but were unable to put them
    away.
    
    
    
    
    
    The RPI runners, who appeared broken after the 1st
    mile, were coming back. After the half-way point, one was catching up
    to Frank and Leif, and another was running right on Ed. By 3 1/2
    miles 1 RPI runner had overtaken Leif and was moving on Frank. Three
    more Rensselaer harriers had moved past Ed and were about to overtake
    Leif. The third MIT group of Liyan Guo '01, Ray Molnar '00, and Jeff
    Billing '01, as well as Phil Loiselle '01, who had fallen back from
    the second group, were making a strong run at the RPI group trailing
    Leif.
    
    
    
    
    
    A constant pace allowed the top two RPI runners to
    pass Frank in the last mile and earn 3th and 4th places. A strong
    last mile and a half by Ed caught 2 of the 4 RPI runners and place
    him just behind Frank for 6th place. Leif and Liyan had fine kicks to
    pass the 4th RPI runner to garner 8th and 9th places to round out
    MIT's top 6. 
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT hosts very strong teams from Bates
    and Tufts at Franklin Park. Tufts is ranked in the top 10 in the
    country.

    On Saturday, MIT Men's Cross Country Team, played
    host to nationally ranked Tufts (8th), and Bates (24th) at Franklin
    Park. On a warm, but dry and breezy day, MIT's harriers ran their
    plan, patiently worked their way through the opposing team's runners,
    and ended up winning in the last mile of the five mile race by a
    score of 35 to 42 for Tufts, and 48 to Bates.
    
    
    
    
    
    The race began with eventual winner, Michael
    Danahy from Bates, Matt Lyons from Tufts, and Mark Strauss '01, Mike
    Parkins '99, and Dan Feldman '02, from MIT, leading the way through a
    fast but controlled 5:00 first mile. Both Tufts and Bates had over 10
    runners each in front of MIT's next runners, who came through in
    5:15.
    
    
    
    
    
    By the second mile mark, the same 5 were leading
    the way, with a wide gap separating them from the rest of the runners
    who were packed in small groups. MIT's 4-7 runners were still behind
    at least eight Tuft's runners, but had closed the gap
    somewhat.
    
    
    
    
    
    The third mile, which is partly run through the
    "wilderness loop", was where MIT made up the most ground. They had
    already reeled in most of the Bate's runners, and had the Tuft's
    runners in sight.
    
    
    
    
    
    By the time they came out of the wilderness for
    the second time, enroute to the 4th mile mark, Ed Keehr '01, and
    Frank Johnston '00 had completely closed the gap on Tuft's 3-6
    runners. Ed then ran a fantastic last mile, catching all four Tuft's
    runners to lead MIT to victory.
    
    
    
    
    
    Danahy, who had fallen behind Strauss during the
    4th mile, had a furious charge in the last half-mile. He opened up a
    small gap on Strauss and held on for a 2 second victory in 25:29.
    Parkins was nine seconds behind and was followed by Lyons and
    Patterson from Tufts. Feldman held on for 6th place. 
    
    
    
    
    
    Showing their depth, MIT place 13 runners ahead of
    Tuft's 9th runner and Bates 10 runner. Next week, MIT is again at
    Franklin Park for the annual Codfish Bowl, hosted by UMass/Boston.

    **10TH RANKED TECH FAILS IN BID TO QUALIFY FOR NATIONALS**
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    November 14, 1998
    
    
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT Men's Cross Country team traveled to Babson College on
    Saturday to compete in the combined NCAA Qualifier and New England
    Division III Championship. Ranked 10th in the country for Division
    III and 2nd in New England, Tech hoped to extend their season another
    week by placing among the top 4 teams to qualify for Nationals. It
    was not to be as the consistent top 2 of Mark Strauss '01, Mike
    Parkins '99, failed to provide the leadership, finishing 6th and 5th
    on the team respectively.
    
    
    
    
    
    Going into the race, there were 6 New England teams ranked in the
    top 25 in the country for Division III. MIT knew it would be a
    challenge to be one of the qualifying teams. With a tremendous
    conference championship fresh on their minds, the Tech harriers
    wanted to compete for the win. The plan was to get out in position,
    but to be sure and keep some Williams, Tufts, and Brandeis runners in
    front to run off of. The first two miles were to be easy, and to
    begin moving up in groups after that point.
    
    
    
    
    
    The race began with a fast 1st mile of 4:44 for the large lead
    pack, Strauss and Parkins followed closely in 4:46 in 14th and 15th
    positions. Chris McGuire '00, and Dan Feldman '02, were in the
    position they wanted at 23rd and 24th, but a little fast in 4:49.
    Sean Montgomery '01, and Phil Loiselle '01 also were positioned well
    at 39th and 40th in 4:54. During the 2nd mile things were already
    looking bad as Strauss was looking tired and Parkins was already
    fading. The others were still in good position and looked as if they
    were ready to run. Williams College was ahead along with Keene State,
    but Tufts and Brandeis were well within reach.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 3rd mile was more of the same. Strauss was still leading the
    team, but had faded to 18th position, and Parkins had faded to 20th.
    Feldman, possibly accustomed to running off of Strauss and Parkins,
    also began to fade as he fell to 24th with McGuire following suit at
    29th. Good news was that Montgomery and Loiselle had moved up to 30th
    and 31st places. MIT was already in 5th place at this point.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 4th mile was disastrous for MIT. Strauss ran a 5:30 mile,
    moving to 5th on the team. Parkins ran a 5:24 and moved back to
    Feldman and Loiselle. McGuire had moved up considerably, as had
    Loiselle and Montgomery, but it was not enough to catch the front
    teams.
    
    
    
    
    
    The last mile and finish changed little for MIT. Season best
    performances were provided by McGuire in 23rd at 26:01, Loiselle in
    25th at 26:03, and Montgomery in 28th at 26:09. Feldman ran okay in
    27th at 26:07, but had run :04 faster 6 weeks earlier under worse
    conditions. Parkins and Strauss finished in 26:10 and 26:20
    respectively to finish in 29th and 34th places, but had run 25:51 and
    25:52 6 weeks earlier on the same course, and 26:11 and 26:01 on a
    very challenging Coast Guard course just two weeks prior.
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT finished in 5th position just 19 points behind Brandeis. :30
    faster cumulatively for MIT would have provided a trip to Nationals
    and a chance of redemption. That opportunity now must wait until next
    year, when MIT will field a team that will be entirely intact except
    for Parkins. The personal bests by Loiselle and Montgomery were an
    excellent way to end the season. McGuire coming back from his month
    long injury and finish #1 was a real tribute to his determination and
    competitiveness. Feldman had an excellent rookie year. The delta of
    :09 through the first 5 runners, combined with nine graduating
    runners who finished in front of them, makes for some lofty hopes for
    next year's harriers.
    
    
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    BACK TO CROSS COUNTRY
    
    
    



    
    
    
    **MEN'S TEAM FALTERS AT ALL NEW ENGLANDS,
    FINISHES 13TH OVERALL AND 4TH AMONG DIVISION III COLLEGES**
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    Boston, MA
    
    
    
    
    
    October 16, 1998
    
    
    
    
    
    It was a great day for Cross Country or just about anything else
    you might want to do outdoors. It was an especially good day for the
    All New England Championships, pitting the best colleges throughout
    New England, regardless of division, against one another. This annual
    meeting always seems to inspire the best, or at least the initiative
    to do their best, from the competitors.
    
    
    
    
    
    This day was no different as the entire complexion and strategy
    for the race was changed when the motivated runners came through the
    first mile in 4:29 on a somewhat wet course. The lead MIT runners got
    caught up in this ambitious pace as Mike Parkins '99, came through in
    4:36 at about 30th position. he was closely followed by Mark Strauss
    '01, in 4:39 at 35th position, Dan Feldman '02, in 4:42 for 60th
    position, Sean Montgomery '01, in 116th position at 4:50, and Phil
    Loiselle '01, in 140th position at 4:55. In essence, this means that
    either the Tech runners were on their way to either a phenomenal race
    or a disastrous one.
    
    
    
    
    
    While the results may not have been disastrous, they were
    certainly were not encouraging. In defense of his runners, Coach
    Halston Taylor said he was responsible to some degree for telling his
    team to go out in a specific range of places at the first mile rather
    than paying closer attention to the time.
    
    
    
    
    
    Overall, Strauss was the first MIT finisher in 34th place with a
    season best 25:14. To go out in such a fast first mile and not lose
    ground is truly a gutsy and painful way to race. Parkins faded to
    59th in 25:35, and he was followed by Feldman in 66th with a personal
    best of 25:39, Loiselle in 104th with a personal best 26:09,
    Montgomery in 113th with a personal best of 26:16, and Frank Johnston
    '00, the only one who had gone out with a sane pace of 4:59 at mile
    one, in 131st with a personal best of 26:32.
    
    
    
    
    
    It is difficult to be disatisfied with a race that produces 4 of 6
    personal bests and 5 of 6 season bests, but anytime the variance
    between the fastest and slowest mile is over 40 seconds on such a
    flat course, the runners are generally going out to fast and
    adversely affecting their overall performance. In this case, it meant
    losing to two teams MIT had previously beaten, Tufts, and Brandeis.
    Overall, MIT finished 13th among the 39 competing teams. Among
    division III colleges, MIT finished 4th as Williams also beat Tech
    with a fine 9th place effort to finish 1st among Division III
    colleges.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the sub-varsity division, MIT ran more like they had planned to
    do. The front group broke up early as Chris McGuire '00, continued to
    make his way back to varsity status, and broke away a little early.
    Leif Seed '99, another former varsity member coming back from injury,
    went with him in 4:59 at the mile mark. Overall, 18 of 20 runners in
    the sub-varsity race ran season bests, one, Reid Andersen '01, by
    :50.
    
    
    
    
    
    McGuire led the way with a 31st place finish in 26:32 to lead MIT
    to an 8th place finish, 2nd among Division III colleges to show the
    depth of the team. The time between the first and fifth runners was
    :42.
    
    
    
    
    
    Next week, MIT travels to Grafton, MA to race Tufts and UMass
    Boston on Tufts home course.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    



    
    
    
    **MIT SWEEPS NEWMAC CHAMPIONSHIP**
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    October 31, 1998
    
    
    
    
    
    The Men's Cross Country Team made an early morning trip to the
    Coast Guard Academy for the inaugural NEWMAC Cross Country
    Championship today. Going into the meet as favorites, MIT, the 12th
    ranked team in NCAA Division III, did not disappoint as they swept to
    a perfect score of 15 points on the very hilly course.
    
    
    
    
    
    The course, starting out on the athletic fields, and looping
    around 1 1/2 times can give the uninitiated a false sense of what the
    course is really like--flat it isn't. Knowing this, the Coast Guard
    runners nevertheless took it out hard as they led the way to a first
    mile of 5:00. Mark Strauss '01, Mike Parkins '99, and Dan Feldman
    '02, were right on the two Coast Guard runners by the mile and half
    mark. Right behind them were three more Coast Guard harriers again
    followed by three MIT runners (Chris McGuire '00, Sean Montgomery
    '01, and Phil Loiselle '01).
    
    
    
    
    
    After some grueling hills in the narrow woods, MIT crossed the
    three mile mark in total command of the race with Parkins well in
    front, followed by Strauss and Feldman. McGuire, Montgomery, and
    Loiselle were right behind the lone remaining Coastie in sight. After
    a little more woods, the course returned to pavement and a very long
    uphill route back to campus. The Tech runners were prepared for this
    and thus the reason for the cautious first two miles.
    
    
    
    
    
    Once back up on campus the course then turned downhill or the
    final half mile. Parkins was led astray by a supposed course monitor
    but realized his error in time to get back into second place. The
    course finished around the cinder track and into the chute at the end
    of the straightway. Strauss held onto the lead to earn NEWMAC runner
    of the year and set a course record of 26:01. The previous record had
    been held by MIT's own David Moyle '92, in 26:15. Parkins was :10
    behind. Eleven seconds back in fourth was the NEWMAC rookie of the
    year, Dan Feldman, with a 26:20. McGuire is nearly back to his old
    form as he finished third, just :09 behind Parkins. Montgomery
    completed the sweep by outkicking Michael Sharp of Coast Guard 26:26
    to 26:28. Loiselle followed for 7th overall. Ed Keehr '01, was 10th
    overall to put 7 MIT runners in the top 10, who all made
    All-Conference.
    
    
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
    RETURN TO CROSS COUNTRY
    
    
    



    
    
    
    **MIT FINISHES REGULAR SEASON UNDEFEATED**
    
    
    
    **WITH VICTORY OVER TUFTS**
    
    
    
    
    
    October 24, 1998
    
    
    
    
    
    MIT traveled to Grafton, MA for the last regular season contest
    versus Tufts and UMass Boston. MIT came from behind to pull ahead in
    the 4th mile and hold on for a 4 point victory, 26-30, over 12th
    ranked Tufts. UMass Boston was overmatched, scoring 82 points.
    
    
    
    
    
    Tufts had avenged an early season loss to MIT just last week with
    a great effort in the all division New England Championships. In that
    race, MIT had been taken out of their race plan with much too fast
    early pace. This week Tech stuck to their plan and ran a well paced
    race.
    
    
    
    
    
    Tufts almost ran away with the race when Tufts' top runner, Matt
    Lyons, ran hard to a sizable 1st mile lead as he came through in 5:03
    on the challenging course, and was followed closely by two of his
    teammates. Mike Parkins '99 was not far behind, along with Mark
    Strauss '01, and Dan Feldman '02. Sean Montgomery '01, Phil Loiselle
    '01, and Chris McGuire '00 trailed Tufts' 4-6 runners, and were far
    enough behind to cause concern.
    
    
    
    
    
    During the 2nd mile, the 2nd and 3rd Tufts' runners started fading
    badly. Parkins had moved into 2nd place and Strauss and Feldman were
    moving into position to catch Tufts' 2nd runner. Montgomery,
    Loiselle, and McGuire had moved up to the 5th Tufts runner, who was
    not letting them pass easily.
    
    
    
    
    
    The 3rd mile, the slowest in the race, still had Parkins in 2nd
    with Strauss and Feldman running just ahead of the Tuft's 2nd and 3rd
    runners. Montgomery, Loiselle, and McGuire were closing on the 4th
    Tufts runner and had put some distance between them and the Tufts 5th
    man.
    
    
    
    
    
    During the 4th mile, Montgomery made a big move going up the big
    hill, moving past the Tufts 4th runner and began making his move on
    Strauss and Feldman, who were still 16 seconds ahead at the 4 mile
    mark. The Tufts runners who had gone out hard were obviously paying
    for it, while those who had held back were coming on pretty strong.
    It began to look like if MIT could hold on it would be because of the
    plan to run even throughout the race.
    
    
    
    
    
    In the last mile, Parkins held his position and eventually
    finished 12 seconds behind Lyons for 2nd place. Montgomery caught
    Feldman and Strauss but none of them could catch the 2nd Tufts
    runner, who showed a very strong finish. Feldman kicked past
    Montgomery for 4th and 5th with Strauss in 6th. Loiselle and McGuire
    held on 9th and 10th, 8 seconds ahead of Tufts' 5th man to secure the
    victory.
    
    
    
    
    
    This victory gave MIT a 6-0 record in non-invitational meets, and
    a near perfect invitational record, winning two and losing only to
    Williams College in the third. Next week, MIT travels to Coast Guard
    for the inaugural NEWMAC (New England Women's and Men's Athletic
    Conference) Cross Country Championship.
