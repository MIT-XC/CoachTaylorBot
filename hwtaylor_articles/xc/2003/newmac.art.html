  <p><strong><font size="+2">MIT Places Seven Runners Among All Conference Team</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">November 1, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">Apprehensive about competing on a challenging, risky course 
    and perhaps mistakenly looking ahead to the NCAA Regional Qualifying Meet 
    in two weeks, the MIT cross country team nevertheless took care of business 
    by winning its sixth consecutive NEWMAC Championship, continuing as the only 
    team to ever win the men's title.</p>
  <p align="left">Led by Ben Schmeckpeper's second place finish in 25:22, MIT 
    finished with 29 points to second place Coast Guard's 51. Following Coast 
    Guard were Wheaton College with 80, Springfield College with 126, WPI with 
    133, Babson College with 137 and host, Clark University with 185. Schmeckpeper 
    and, winner Stan Pyle of Wheaton College, ran neck and neck for the first 
    two and half miles. Schmeckpeper pulled away, opening up a 20 meter gap by 
    the three mile mark but did not push the fourth mile enough and had his hamstrings 
    cramp up early in mile four. Once Pyle pulled back in front, he never looked 
    back, defeating Schmeckpeper for the second race in a row, although the gap 
    this time was only six seconds.</p>
  <p align="left">Following Schmeckpeper on the team was Eric Khatchadourian in 
    4th place and Chris Fidkowski in 5th place. Both runners ran personal bests 
    even though the course was extremely hilly, had soft ground and was run in 
    70 degree temperatures. Not running very strong races, probably due to a lack 
    of mental preparation and poor race tactics, were Kevin Brulois in 8th, Brian 
    Anderson in 10th and John Brewer in 12th. Brulois, despite running a less 
    than perfect race, earned Rookie of the Year honors for the NEWMAC Conference. 
    MIT's delta for their top five runners ballooned to 1:50. Nevertheless, MIT 
    escaped unscathed with a convincing victory.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's next race will be their final one for 2003 if they continue 
    to look ahead and not focus on the task at hand. Seeded sixth in the region 
    with only four teams allowed to qualify for the NCAA Championships, MIT must 
    run a perfect race if they are to break into the top four in two weeks at 
    the Twin Brook cross country course in southern Maine.</p>
