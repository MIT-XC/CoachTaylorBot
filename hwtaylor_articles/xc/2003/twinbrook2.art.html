  <p><strong><font size="4">MIT HARRIERS ENGINEER :26 DELTA FOR BEST SHOWING OF 
    SEASON</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">October 18, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">MIT Men's cross country team ran significantly better at the 
    Twin Brook cross country course than they did last week at the All New Englands. 
    A return to group running greatly improved the results, allowing MIT's second 
    and third groups to work together and pull the team to a second place finish 
    in the 12 team field. Tufts University confirmed their number one ranking 
    in New England with a low score of 37 points. MIT followed with 64 points, 
    but more importantly, only :45 seconds cumulative time behind Tufts for the 
    top five runners.</p>
  <p align="left">The hilly course, made up of rolling hills and steep gulleys 
    is usually difficult enough. This meet was complicated by an earlier rain 
    that left the course muddy. The men's race was the fourth of the day, making 
    the footing a little slippery on the steep downhills. The temperatures however 
    were near perfect in the mid 50s.</p>
  <p align="left">Once again, Ben Schmeckpeper led the way for the Engineers with 
    a 3rd place time of 27:07, a relatively slow time compared to his 26:33 from 
    two weeks ago on the same course. Running a little faster for the first mile 
    and not having anyone within sight to chase down contributed to the slow performance. 
    Stan Pyle from Wheaton College showed superior form and intensity as he pulled 
    away at the start and never looked back, opening up a 25 second lead by the 
    end of the second mile. Schmeckpeper may have still been feeling the residual 
    effects from his oustanding effort at the All New Englands last week.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's second group of Brian Anderson, Eric Khatchadourian, Kevin 
    Brulois and John Brewer ran together for nearly the entire race, communicating 
    with each other for nearly three miles before a small gap opened up. Anderson 
    pulled away, eventually moving up to eighth place with a 27:18 time. Khatchadourian 
    ran with Brewer until after mile four, finishing strong to place 14th in 27:25. 
    Brewer faded in the final mile but sprinted to catch Brulois at the finish. 
    Brulois faded during mile three, maintained a five second gap and then finished 
    well in the final mile, finishing in 19th place, one place ahead of Brewer 
    in the same time of 27:33.</p>
  <p align="left">Supporting the top five, MIT runners ran to many personal bests 
    on the challenging course. Chris Fidkowski ran another great race, improving 
    by :18 over three weeks ago and finishing sixth on the team. Spencer Dudley 
    did not have much left in the final mile but he certainly ran well for the 
    first four in knocking :38 off his PR on the Twin Brook course. Kevin Digenova 
    dropped :18, Steve Stoddard :12 and Eric Nelson :01.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's next outing will be their defense of the NEWMAC Conference 
    Championship on November 1 at 12:00 noon. The race will be held in Boylston, 
    MA, starting at the Town Hall.</p>
