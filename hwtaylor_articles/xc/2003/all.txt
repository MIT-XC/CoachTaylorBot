        MEET**
    
    
      
    
    September 6, 2003
    
    
      
    
    MIT's men's cross country team debuted in the 2003 season with 
        a sweep over the alumni at Franklin Park. With 75 degree temperatures keeping 
        things somewhat comfortable, Ben Schmeckpeper led the way from the start with 
        a 25:53 effort to easily win the race.
    
    
      
    
    It is always a surprise who among the "Has Beens" 
        will show up to run in the annual varsity-alumni race that kicks off the start 
        of the cross country season. Usually, there are other surprises that have 
        to do with the course, such as no electricity to run the computers, the portable 
        toilet does not show up, some other sports event is going on somewhere on 
        the course, or a neighborhood party is taking place on the starting line. 
        What is not expected is for a fire to start in an area adjacent to the course, 
        but then again, we should not be surprised. While watching the women's race, 
        one of the alumnae said she saw a fire developing over by "Bear Cage 
        Hill". Coach Taylor along with a former women's team member found the 
        small brush fire and put it out before it got out of hand.
    
    
      
    
    As the race started, everyone let Schmeckpeper go, conceding 
        the victory to the All America runner. Brian Anderson, John Brewer, Fivos 
        Constantinou and Eric Khatchadourian followed about ten seconds back at the 
        mile mark along with alumni, Ethan Crain '95, Bob Collins '82 and Craig Wildman 
        '03. By the end of the third mile, it was apparent the alumni would not be 
        able to compete with the four MIT runners, but with Constantinou falling back 
        to an achilles injury, it seemed Crain and Collins would be able to prevent 
        a varsity sweep.
    
    
      
    
    In the final mile, freshman Kevin Brulois continued his move 
        into the top five with a 5:03 effort for mile five to finish in 27:05. Brulois 
        moved up nearly 20 seconds on the leaders (with the exception of Schmeckpeper) 
        over the final two miles. Anderson had a great start to the season, running 
        26:43 to finish second. Khatchadourian ran an outstanding race despite dry 
        heaving over the last 1/2 mile. Khatchadourian placed third with a time of 
        26:46. Brewer, running healthy for the first time in his collegiate cross 
        country career, finished fourth with a personal best of 26:55.
    
    
      
    
    Freshmen finished 5th (Brulois), 6th (Spencer Dudley), 7th (Robert 
        Bryant), 8th (Kevin DiGenova) and 10th (Sam Berberian) within the team, all 
        within a minute of each other. With Steve Maltas and Carlos Renjifo out indefinitely 
        with injuries sustained during the summer, the good group of freshmen may 
        not be enough to make a difference in 2003, but certainly in 2004 and beyond.
    
    
      
    
    Other alumni who participated were, Sean Montgomery, Ryan Peoples, 
        John Biesiadecki and Rob Casadonte. Alumni present and cheering, but not racing, 
        were Liyan Guo, Chris McGuire, Chuck Van Buren and Sean Nolan.
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT hosts the Engineer's Cup at Franklin Park against 
        RPI and WPI at 2:00.

    **MIT ENGINEERS SWEEP OVER RPI AND WPI**

    Once Ben Schmeckpeper left the starting line he never saw another 
        runner until he turned around after going through the finish chute 25:34 later. 
        Likewise, teammates John Brewer, Kevin Brulois, Eric Khatchadourian and Brian 
        Anderson ran together and never saw an opponent after the start of the race. 
        The top five had a perfect score of 15 points to RPI's 48 and WPI's 84.
    
    
      
    
    Tech placed eight of the first nine runners and 11 of the first 
        14 to totally dominate the meet. Despite going out a little too fast for their 
        plan, but not necessarily their abilities, the engineers ran an outstanding 
        final two miles to finish with many season and personal bests.
    
    
      
    
    MIT ran well, but the overwhelming victory was due more to the 
        fact that RPI and WPI had graduated many of its top runners and were simply 
        not very strong. Next week, when the Tech harriers travel to the UMass Dartmouth 
        Invitational, they will most definitely face much stiffer competition against 
        nationally ranked Tufts University and Keene State College.
    
    
      
    
    Many MIT runners posted personal bests in the mild, but muggy 
        conditions. Brewer's 26:28 for second place was a :27 PR despite blisters 
        received during the race. Freshman, Kevin Brulois, improved :31 to place third. 
        Grad. student, Chris Fidkowski, had the race of the day as he ran a personal 
        best of 27:30, 1:20 faster than his xc debut last week. Kevin DiGenova improved 
        by :12 to place 7th on the team and 8th overall. Sam Berberian only improved 
        :09 but ran a much better race. 800 runner, Steve Stoddard, showed he might 
        have a future in cross country as he improved :34 to run 29:07. Jesus Alvarez 
        ran a great race, improving by :15 in running 29:30.
    
    
      
    
    MIT knows that in order to be considered a serious contender 
        for a national birth, they need to get their delta for men one through five 
        down to under one minute. While it is currently 1:25 it will likely get much 
        worse as Schmeckpeper faces competition if others on the team do not improve 
        an equal amount.

    **SCHMECKPEPER FALLS SHORT OF ALL AMERICA**
    
    
      
    
    November 22, 2003
    
    
      
    
    After winning the NCAA Division III New England Regional title 
        last week, Ben Schmeckpeper was expecting to improve significantly on his 
        32nd place All America finish in 2002 at the NCAA Division III Championships. 
        This was not to be as Schmeckpeper faded from an early position of eighth 
        place to a final position of 38th place out of 215 of the best runners in 
        the country, just missing All America honors by three places at the 2003 meet 
        held at Hanover College in Hanover, Indiana.
    
    
      
    
    Whether he started out a little too hard for the conditions, 
        which were 70 degrees with soft ground from all the rain the week before, 
        or just a little too anxious about the race, will not be known. What is known 
        is that he gave the race his best effort as he has done all season. Coach 
        Taylor said, "Even though Ben did not place as high as he would have 
        liked, he certainly gave it his best effort and that is all anyone can ask".
    
    
      
    
    Schmeckpeper went out hard but not quite with the leaders. The 
        course was very rolling with few areas that were flat. By the first kilometer, 
        Schmeckpeper had moved up to 15th position. Moving up gradually over the next 
        two kilometers, he reached eighth position somewhere early in the third mile. 
        By the end of mile three Schmeckpeper began to fade a little and by the end 
        of mile four he was holding onto about 32nd place. His legs not responding, 
        Schmeckpeper could only try his best to hold on and try to push towards the 
        finish. His time of 25:55 was a fine effort and represented MIT and New England 
        well but did not garner him another All America honor.
    
    
      
    
    Next year, Schmeckpeper has his sights on breaking into the 
        top five at this meet and help the team make one of the top four spots in 
        New England, which would earn them a trip to this meet, to be held at the 
        University of Wisconsin Eau Claire in 2004.

    Seeded fifth going into the NCAA Division III Regional Qualifier, 
        MIT's cross country team could not surpass their seed, missing a national 
        qualifying spot by 3 points behind Amherst College. The varsity runners will 
        probably be doing the "should of, could of, would of" for the next 
        twelve months. Ben Schmeckpeper followed his plan to perfection, pulling away 
        to a 10 second victory to become the first individual from MIT to win this 
        prestigious race since Paul Neves in 1981.
    
    
      
    
    MIT's secret to success this year has been their trail group 
        of Brian Anderson, Kevin Brulois, John Brewer and Eric Khatchadourian sticking 
        and working together to run down teams. This team work has been successful 
        to bring the group to within 1:00 of Schmeckpeper, which is what was thought 
        to be necessary to qualify for the NCAA Championship. Today, that teamwork 
        never happened, at least not with those mentioned above. Anderson got out 
        well, perhaps a few seconds too fast at the mile mark, but necessary to keep 
        from having to catch too many people during the race. Brewer sort of went 
        with him, but was concerned the pace was too fast. This distraction was enough 
        to take away from the focus needed to fight the pain later in the race. Brulois 
        and Khatchadourian went out at their own pace, moved up the entire race, but 
        never got up to where they needed to be. Most of this difficulty was due to 
        the talented runners from the top teams of Tufts, Keene State and Williams 
        College. The fast early pace pushed nearly everyone, and those who decided 
        to run conservatively at the start were forced to pass too many people on 
        a wet, soft and sometimes frozen course in wind chill conditions in the 20s.
    
    
      
    
    In spite of all this, "these guys ran great" said 
        Coach Halston Taylor. Coach Taylor added, "it is easy to look back and 
        find where you could have made up three points, but running a gutsy, determined 
        race is what got them so close in the first place. Maybe if the second group 
        stayed and worked together we would have run faster, but maybe not. Anderson 
        and Chris Fidkowski ran outstanding races." Fidkowski improved by over 
        :30 as he finished 5th on the team in his first year of collegiate cross country.
    
    
      
    
    Anderson moved up to 23rd position after the 3rd mile and appeared 
        ready to contend for one of the potential nine individual spots to Nationals. 
        However, he began to slide a little and ended up 28th, easily his best race 
        of his cross country career. Brulois moved up throughout the race to finish 
        in 38th, the fifth freshman in the entire race. Brewer slipped back to 39th 
        place from his best position of 34th after the 3rd mile. Fidkowski followed 
        closely in 42nd after working with Brulois much of the race. Khatchadourian, 
        perhaps waited a little too long to move up, but nevertheless ran pretty well 
        and finished 53rd.
    
    
      
    
    Schmeckpeper's plan was to take his time over the first two 
        miles, moving up gradually to within striking distance of the leaders. At 
        mile two he was in 5th place and at mile three he was in 4th position. His 
        plan was to take the lead at about three and half miles and he was aided by 
        the fact that the lead vehicle went the wrong way, taking the top two runners, 
        enabling Schmeckpeper to take the lead sooner than expected. "I saw the 
        top two go with the lead vehicle but I knew the course and went the right 
        way", said Schmeckpeper. He extended his lead and then held on in the 
        final 800 to win by 10 seconds. "It was definitely Ben's top race this 
        season and proved his race at the All New England's was for real", said 
        Coach Taylor.
    
    
      
    
    The team is not going to Hanover College next week, but Schmeckpeper 
        is, and he is going to try and improve on his 32nd All American position at 
        last year's Nationals.

    **SCHMECKPEPER'S 13TH PLACE IN NEICAAA CHAMPIONSHIP 
        ONE OF FEW HIGHLIGHTS FOR ENGINEERS**
    
    
      
    
    October 10, 2003
    
    
      
    
    While the race meant little in the big scheme of things this 
        season, Coach Halston Taylor nevertheless expected his team to do much better 
        than their 17th place in this weekend's NEICAAA Championship at Franklin Park. 
        This race is essentially the only race in the season that brings together 
        the best teams in all three divisions in New England and is very comparable 
        to the NCAA Division III Championships at the end of the season. The engineers 
        seemed mentally unprepared for the most part during the warm, dusty afternoon.
    
    
      
    
    Junior, Ben Schmeckpeper, was affected by the fast early pace 
        and the poor conditions, but did not let it hinder his overall performance. 
        Moving up deliberately through the pack of lead runers, Schmeckpeper constantly 
        gained ground throughout the race, eventually sprinting to a 13th place finish 
        with a time of 24:56. The Wisconsin native was the first Division III finisher.
    
    
      
    
    MIT's second group, hoping to finsih between :50 and 1:20 of 
        Schmeckpeper, fell apart early in the race. Freshman, Kevin Brulois, continued 
        to shine as he let nothing bother him en route to a 78th place personal best 
        of 26:04. Not faring so well were the veterans of his group, Brian Anderson, 
        John Brewer and Eric Khatchadourian. Normally very dependable when they pace 
        themselves well early, this was not the case in this race.
    
    
      
    
    Running with the top seven for the first time, Chris Fidkowski 
        and Ian Driver ran superb races to help Tech from finishing even worse than 
        17th. Fidkowski ran his plan to perfection as he showed after the race by 
        holding out his hand with his mile split goals written on the back. Fidkowski's 
        time of 26:45 was a 45 second personal best and placed him 5th on the team. 
        Driver also ran a perfect plan except for a short lack of focus during mile 
        two where he lost a few seconds. Perhaps the best race of the day was turned 
        in during the sub-varsity race by freshman Spencer Dudley. Dudley placed 26th 
        with a 26:53, a 50 second PR to lead all MIT finishers in that race.
    
    
      
    
    Despite such a poor team effort, the Engineers still finished 
        5th among Division III teams, one place out of the top four that will qualify 
        for nationals in the regional qualifier on November 15. Next Saturday, MIT 
        travels to the regional course at Twin Brook recreation area in southern Maine 
        with hopes of getting their act together and putting themselves in position 
        to be one of the top four teams at the end of the season.

    Apprehensive about competing on a challenging, risky course 
        and perhaps mistakenly looking ahead to the NCAA Regional Qualifying Meet 
        in two weeks, the MIT cross country team nevertheless took care of business 
        by winning its sixth consecutive NEWMAC Championship, continuing as the only 
        team to ever win the men's title.
    
    
      
    
    Led by Ben Schmeckpeper's second place finish in 25:22, MIT 
        finished with 29 points to second place Coast Guard's 51. Following Coast 
        Guard were Wheaton College with 80, Springfield College with 126, WPI with 
        133, Babson College with 137 and host, Clark University with 185. Schmeckpeper 
        and, winner Stan Pyle of Wheaton College, ran neck and neck for the first 
        two and half miles. Schmeckpeper pulled away, opening up a 20 meter gap by 
        the three mile mark but did not push the fourth mile enough and had his hamstrings 
        cramp up early in mile four. Once Pyle pulled back in front, he never looked 
        back, defeating Schmeckpeper for the second race in a row, although the gap 
        this time was only six seconds.
    
    
      
    
    Following Schmeckpeper on the team was Eric Khatchadourian in 
        4th place and Chris Fidkowski in 5th place. Both runners ran personal bests 
        even though the course was extremely hilly, had soft ground and was run in 
        70 degree temperatures. Not running very strong races, probably due to a lack 
        of mental preparation and poor race tactics, were Kevin Brulois in 8th, Brian 
        Anderson in 10th and John Brewer in 12th. Brulois, despite running a less 
        than perfect race, earned Rookie of the Year honors for the NEWMAC Conference. 
        MIT's delta for their top five runners ballooned to 1:50. Nevertheless, MIT 
        escaped unscathed with a convincing victory.
    
    
      
    
    MIT's next race will be their final one for 2003 if they continue 
        to look ahead and not focus on the task at hand. Seeded sixth in the region 
        with only four teams allowed to qualify for the NCAA Championships, MIT must 
        run a perfect race if they are to break into the top four in two weeks at 
        the Twin Brook cross country course in southern Maine.

    **MIT RACES TO CLOSE 3RD PLACE FINISH AT TWIN BROOK 
        XC INVITATIONAL**
    
    
      
    
    9/27/03
    
    
      
    
    MIT Men's cross country team made amends for last weeks overly 
        ambitious race with a much more well controlled first two miles in the first 
        of two Twin Brook XC Invitationals. The result, for the most part, was a much 
        better spread for the top five runners as well as a close third place team 
        finish to Williams College and Bates College in the 13 team race, 60 points 
        to 74, to 76 respectively.
    
    
      
    
    Most teams, with the exception of Middlebury College, which 
        had five of the top six places at the mile mark, were very respectful of the 
        rolling and winding terrain. The lead runner came through the slightly uphill 
        first mile in 5:20 with the first MIT runner hanging back in 5:31.
    
    
      
    
    Mile two was a good mile for MIT, perhaps a little too good. 
        Eric Khatchadourian had moved up to a close third place and Brian Anderson 
        fourth place at the two mile mark. Ben Schmeckpeper was hanging a couple of 
        seconds back, and John Brewer and Kevin Brulois were only four seconds behind 
        Khatchadourian. Williams and Bates Colleges were moving up but did not seem 
        to be a huge threat at the time.
    
    
      
    
    Schmeckpeper pushed the difficult third mile, opening up a slight 
        lead by the three mile mark. Brulois and Khatchadourian stayed close, four 
        and six seconds respectively, but Brewer (14 sec.) and Anderson (22 sec.) 
        began to fall back. Bates College was pulling nearly even with MIT and Williams 
        appeared to be closing.
    
    
      
    
    The fourth mile was very winding but mostly flat. MIT was still 
        winning by the four mile mark but Williams had pulled ahead of Bates and appeared 
        poised for a big finish. Schmeckpeper was still leading along with the lead 
        Williams runner. Brulois was only 10 seconds down and holding on nicely. Brewer 
        had regained some energy and joined Khatchadourian :28 back of Schmeckpeper. 
        Anderson had a tough time of it, falling back by 53 seconds. Ian Driver and 
        Chris Fidkowski were running strong and had moved up to support MIT's cause.
    
    
      
    
    The final mile, which is slightly downhill, was a good one for 
        MIT, but even better for Williams and Bates. Schmeckpeper wheeled a 4:44 final 
        loop and was still beaten by Holtshulte of Williams by :05. Williams put another 
        and Bates two runners ahead of Brulois, who finished 10th overall. Brulois 
        was the second freshmen in the race, getting beaten by Bates top freshman 
        and number one runner. Brewer placed behind Bates third runner, but ahead 
        of Williams third runner. Bates placed their fourth ahead of MIT's fourth, 
        and Williams their fourth, fifth and sixth runners ahead of Anderson, who 
        closed very well with a 4:57 final mile. Khatchadourian, running an outstanding 
        race through three and a half miles, really struggled in the final mile, losing 
        20-25 seconds to the top runners. Driver and Fidkowski placed sixth and seventh 
        for MIT, each beating the respective Bates runners. While MIT ran smarter 
        and more conservative in the early going than they had last week, it appeared 
        they still pushed a little too hard in the second mile.
    
    
      
    
    The strong finish put Williams in front, easily outscoring Bates 
        and MIT. Many New England Division III teams, including MIT, will be racing 
        at the same Twin Brook course in three weeks. MIT's next competition will 
        be the All New England championship at Franklin Park on Friday, October 10.

    **MIT HARRIERS ENGINEER :26 DELTA FOR BEST SHOWING OF 
        SEASON**
    
    
      
    
    October 18, 2003
    
    
      
    
    MIT Men's cross country team ran significantly better at the 
        Twin Brook cross country course than they did last week at the All New Englands. 
        A return to group running greatly improved the results, allowing MIT's second 
        and third groups to work together and pull the team to a second place finish 
        in the 12 team field. Tufts University confirmed their number one ranking 
        in New England with a low score of 37 points. MIT followed with 64 points, 
        but more importantly, only :45 seconds cumulative time behind Tufts for the 
        top five runners.
    
    
      
    
    The hilly course, made up of rolling hills and steep gulleys 
        is usually difficult enough. This meet was complicated by an earlier rain 
        that left the course muddy. The men's race was the fourth of the day, making 
        the footing a little slippery on the steep downhills. The temperatures however 
        were near perfect in the mid 50s.
    
    
      
    
    Once again, Ben Schmeckpeper led the way for the Engineers with 
        a 3rd place time of 27:07, a relatively slow time compared to his 26:33 from 
        two weeks ago on the same course. Running a little faster for the first mile 
        and not having anyone within sight to chase down contributed to the slow performance. 
        Stan Pyle from Wheaton College showed superior form and intensity as he pulled 
        away at the start and never looked back, opening up a 25 second lead by the 
        end of the second mile. Schmeckpeper may have still been feeling the residual 
        effects from his oustanding effort at the All New Englands last week.
    
    
      
    
    MIT's second group of Brian Anderson, Eric Khatchadourian, Kevin 
        Brulois and John Brewer ran together for nearly the entire race, communicating 
        with each other for nearly three miles before a small gap opened up. Anderson 
        pulled away, eventually moving up to eighth place with a 27:18 time. Khatchadourian 
        ran with Brewer until after mile four, finishing strong to place 14th in 27:25. 
        Brewer faded in the final mile but sprinted to catch Brulois at the finish. 
        Brulois faded during mile three, maintained a five second gap and then finished 
        well in the final mile, finishing in 19th place, one place ahead of Brewer 
        in the same time of 27:33.
    
    
      
    
    Supporting the top five, MIT runners ran to many personal bests 
        on the challenging course. Chris Fidkowski ran another great race, improving 
        by :18 over three weeks ago and finishing sixth on the team. Spencer Dudley 
        did not have much left in the final mile but he certainly ran well for the 
        first four in knocking :38 off his PR on the Twin Brook course. Kevin Digenova 
        dropped :18, Steve Stoddard :12 and Eric Nelson :01.
    
    
      
    
    MIT's next outing will be their defense of the NEWMAC Conference 
        Championship on November 1 at 12:00 noon. The race will be held in Boylston, 
        MA, starting at the Town Hall.

    **Harriers Run Poorly, Place 3rd at UMass Dartmouth 
        Invitational**
    
    
      
    
    September 20, 2003
    
    
      
    
    MIT men's cross country team traveled to UMass Dartmouth to 
        run their first big race of the season, hoping to see how they stacked up 
        against much of the Division III competition in New England, specifically 
        Tufts University, ranked 2nd regionally and 14th nationally and Amherst College, 
        ranked 4th regionally. MIT, ranked 5th regionally, placed 3rd with 87 points, 
        behind Amherst with 64 and Tufts with 65 (despite not running three of their 
        top runners), but ahead of 6th ranked Trinity College with 133 points.
    
    
      
    
    Temperatures in the 80s with unseasonably high humidity affected 
        everyone in the races but particularly those who went out too fast. The Tech 
        harriers, anxious to prove they were better than their 5th place ranking, 
        went out too fast for the conditions and paid dearly. The entire latter half 
        of both the varsity and sub-varsity races displayed MIT runners who were more 
        holding on to survive rather than racing to win.
    
    
      
    
    In the varsity race, Ben Schmeckpeper came through the first 
        mile in 4:54, running with a small pack of runners. Shortly before the end 
        of mile two, Schmeckpeper took the lead and began to pull away, opening up 
        a 20 meter lead halfway through the 3rd mile. Brian Anderson, motivated to 
        do his part in his senior year, started off in 5:02 and moved up to 6th place 
        by the end of the 2nd mile, holding that going up the one hill on the course 
        in mile three. Eric Khatchadourian, John Brewer and Kevin Brulois bit off 
        a more than they could chew with their opening mile of 5:03-5:06. Khatchadourian 
        moved up during mile two, but Brewer and Brulois began to show signs of fatigue.
    
    
      
    
    Mile three, slightly uphill in grade, is the key to the race. 
        MIT runners were able to maintain at best during this crucial mile. Mile four, 
        which is downhill, is supposed to be the fastest mile. MIT runners were not 
        able to take advantage of this. Schmeckpeper lost his lead, falling back to 
        third. Anderson fell back to 11th place. Katchadourian and Brewer maintained 
        their place in the low 20s, but Brulois fell back to 42nd position.
    
    
      
    
    In the fifth and final mile, not much changed for MIT. Schmeckpeper 
        held onto his 3rd place, 2nd among collegiate runners, finishing in 25:29. 
        Anderson moved up one place, finishing in 10th in 26:00. Khatchadourian placed 
        21st in 26:31. Brewer lost 17 seconds to Khatchadourian in the final mile, 
        falling back to 26:48 and 25th place. Freshman, Kevin Brulois, placed 41st 
        in 27:16 to round out the MIT scoring.
    
    
      
    
    The sub-varsity race, the final race of the day and perhaps 
        the hottest, gave MIT a chance to show off the majority of their talented 
        freshman class. Ian Driver took a lesson from Schmeckpeper and took the lead 
        during the second mile after a well paced opening mile of 5:21. Shortly behind 
        Driver in 5:23 were freshmen Robby Bryant, Spencer Dudley, Kevin DiGenova 
        and Sam Berberian. Fighting it out with Tufts army of mostly senior runners, 
        MIT and Tufts soon separated themselves from the rest of the field during 
        the second mile.
    
    
      
    
    During mile three, Tufts began to show their experience and 
        dominance. Driver fell behind the lead Tufts' runners, but Bryant moved up 
        to a tie for the lead. Mile four was similar to the varsity race with all 
        Tech runners with the exception of Bryant not able to take advantage of the 
        downhill mile. Tufts runners pulled ahead to 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 places at the 
        end of mile four. Mile five, which was basically survival for MIT runners, 
        saw Tufts move into a sweep of the top five places. Bryant held onto 6th place 
        in 27:26. He was closely followd by graduate student, Chris Fidowski in 27:33, 
        Driver in 27:35, Dudley in 27:43 and DiGenova in 27:48 for a 22 second delta. 
      
    
    
      
    
    Next week, MIT gets another chance to show what they can do 
        if they run smart when they run the regional championship course at Twin Brook 
        Golf Course hosted by Bates College and the University of Southern Maine. 
        Amherst College and Williams College are among those who have declared their 
        intent to compete, giving MIT plenty of competition on the challenging course.
