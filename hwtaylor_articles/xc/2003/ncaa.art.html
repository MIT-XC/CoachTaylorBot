  <p><strong><font size="+3">SCHMECKPEPER FALLS SHORT OF ALL AMERICA</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">November 22, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">After winning the NCAA Division III New England Regional title 
    last week, Ben Schmeckpeper was expecting to improve significantly on his 
    32nd place All America finish in 2002 at the NCAA Division III Championships. 
    This was not to be as Schmeckpeper faded from an early position of eighth 
    place to a final position of 38th place out of 215 of the best runners in 
    the country, just missing All America honors by three places at the 2003 meet 
    held at Hanover College in Hanover, Indiana.</p>
  <p align="left">Whether he started out a little too hard for the conditions, 
    which were 70 degrees with soft ground from all the rain the week before, 
    or just a little too anxious about the race, will not be known. What is known 
    is that he gave the race his best effort as he has done all season. Coach 
    Taylor said, &quot;Even though Ben did not place as high as he would have 
    liked, he certainly gave it his best effort and that is all anyone can ask&quot;.</p>
  <p align="left">Schmeckpeper went out hard but not quite with the leaders. The 
    course was very rolling with few areas that were flat. By the first kilometer, 
    Schmeckpeper had moved up to 15th position. Moving up gradually over the next 
    two kilometers, he reached eighth position somewhere early in the third mile. 
    By the end of mile three Schmeckpeper began to fade a little and by the end 
    of mile four he was holding onto about 32nd place. His legs not responding, 
    Schmeckpeper could only try his best to hold on and try to push towards the 
    finish. His time of 25:55 was a fine effort and represented MIT and New England 
    well but did not garner him another All America honor.</p>
  <p align="left">Next year, Schmeckpeper has his sights on breaking into the 
    top five at this meet and help the team make one of the top four spots in 
    New England, which would earn them a trip to this meet, to be held at the 
    University of Wisconsin Eau Claire in 2004.</p>
