  <p><strong><font size="4">MIT RACES TO CLOSE 3RD PLACE FINISH AT TWIN BROOK 
    XC INVITATIONAL</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">9/27/03</p>
  <p align="left">MIT Men's cross country team made amends for last weeks overly 
    ambitious race with a much more well controlled first two miles in the first 
    of two Twin Brook XC Invitationals. The result, for the most part, was a much 
    better spread for the top five runners as well as a close third place team 
    finish to Williams College and Bates College in the 13 team race, 60 points 
    to 74, to 76 respectively.</p>
  <p align="left">Most teams, with the exception of Middlebury College, which 
    had five of the top six places at the mile mark, were very respectful of the 
    rolling and winding terrain. The lead runner came through the slightly uphill 
    first mile in 5:20 with the first MIT runner hanging back in 5:31.</p>
  <p align="left">Mile two was a good mile for MIT, perhaps a little too good. 
    Eric Khatchadourian had moved up to a close third place and Brian Anderson 
    fourth place at the two mile mark. Ben Schmeckpeper was hanging a couple of 
    seconds back, and John Brewer and Kevin Brulois were only four seconds behind 
    Khatchadourian. Williams and Bates Colleges were moving up but did not seem 
    to be a huge threat at the time.</p>
  <p align="left">Schmeckpeper pushed the difficult third mile, opening up a slight 
    lead by the three mile mark. Brulois and Khatchadourian stayed close, four 
    and six seconds respectively, but Brewer (14 sec.) and Anderson (22 sec.) 
    began to fall back. Bates College was pulling nearly even with MIT and Williams 
    appeared to be closing.</p>
  <p align="left">The fourth mile was very winding but mostly flat. MIT was still 
    winning by the four mile mark but Williams had pulled ahead of Bates and appeared 
    poised for a big finish. Schmeckpeper was still leading along with the lead 
    Williams runner. Brulois was only 10 seconds down and holding on nicely. Brewer 
    had regained some energy and joined Khatchadourian :28 back of Schmeckpeper. 
    Anderson had a tough time of it, falling back by 53 seconds. Ian Driver and 
    Chris Fidkowski were running strong and had moved up to support MIT's cause.</p>
  <p align="left">The final mile, which is slightly downhill, was a good one for 
    MIT, but even better for Williams and Bates. Schmeckpeper wheeled a 4:44 final 
    loop and was still beaten by Holtshulte of Williams by :05. Williams put another 
    and Bates two runners ahead of Brulois, who finished 10th overall. Brulois 
    was the second freshmen in the race, getting beaten by Bates top freshman 
    and number one runner. Brewer placed behind Bates third runner, but ahead 
    of Williams third runner. Bates placed their fourth ahead of MIT's fourth, 
    and Williams their fourth, fifth and sixth runners ahead of Anderson, who 
    closed very well with a 4:57 final mile. Khatchadourian, running an outstanding 
    race through three and a half miles, really struggled in the final mile, losing 
    20-25 seconds to the top runners. Driver and Fidkowski placed sixth and seventh 
    for MIT, each beating the respective Bates runners. While MIT ran smarter 
    and more conservative in the early going than they had last week, it appeared 
    they still pushed a little too hard in the second mile.</p>
  <p align="left">The strong finish put Williams in front, easily outscoring Bates 
    and MIT. Many New England Division III teams, including MIT, will be racing 
    at the same Twin Brook course in three weeks. MIT's next competition will 
    be the All New England championship at Franklin Park on Friday, October 10.</p>
