  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT Places 5th in NCAA New England Division III Region</font></strong></p>

  <p align="left">Seeded fifth going into the NCAA Division III Regional Qualifier, 
    MIT's cross country team could not surpass their seed, missing a national 
    qualifying spot by 3 points behind Amherst College. The varsity runners will 
    probably be doing the &quot;should of, could of, would of&quot; for the next 
    twelve months. Ben Schmeckpeper followed his plan to perfection, pulling away 
    to a 10 second victory to become the first individual from MIT to win this 
    prestigious race since Paul Neves in 1981.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT's secret to success this year has been their trail group 
    of Brian Anderson, Kevin Brulois, John Brewer and Eric Khatchadourian sticking 
    and working together to run down teams. This team work has been successful 
    to bring the group to within 1:00 of Schmeckpeper, which is what was thought 
    to be necessary to qualify for the NCAA Championship. Today, that teamwork 
    never happened, at least not with those mentioned above. Anderson got out 
    well, perhaps a few seconds too fast at the mile mark, but necessary to keep 
    from having to catch too many people during the race. Brewer sort of went 
    with him, but was concerned the pace was too fast. This distraction was enough 
    to take away from the focus needed to fight the pain later in the race. Brulois 
    and Khatchadourian went out at their own pace, moved up the entire race, but 
    never got up to where they needed to be. Most of this difficulty was due to 
    the talented runners from the top teams of Tufts, Keene State and Williams 
    College. The fast early pace pushed nearly everyone, and those who decided 
    to run conservatively at the start were forced to pass too many people on 
    a wet, soft and sometimes frozen course in wind chill conditions in the 20s.</p>
  <p align="left">In spite of all this, &quot;these guys ran great&quot; said 
    Coach Halston Taylor. Coach Taylor added, &quot;it is easy to look back and 
    find where you could have made up three points, but running a gutsy, determined 
    race is what got them so close in the first place. Maybe if the second group 
    stayed and worked together we would have run faster, but maybe not. Anderson 
    and Chris Fidkowski ran outstanding races.&quot; Fidkowski improved by over 
    :30 as he finished 5th on the team in his first year of collegiate cross country.</p>
  <p align="left">Anderson moved up to 23rd position after the 3rd mile and appeared 
    ready to contend for one of the potential nine individual spots to Nationals. 
    However, he began to slide a little and ended up 28th, easily his best race 
    of his cross country career. Brulois moved up throughout the race to finish 
    in 38th, the fifth freshman in the entire race. Brewer slipped back to 39th 
    place from his best position of 34th after the 3rd mile. Fidkowski followed 
    closely in 42nd after working with Brulois much of the race. Khatchadourian, 
    perhaps waited a little too long to move up, but nevertheless ran pretty well 
    and finished 53rd.</p>
  <p align="left">Schmeckpeper's plan was to take his time over the first two 
    miles, moving up gradually to within striking distance of the leaders. At 
    mile two he was in 5th place and at mile three he was in 4th position. His 
    plan was to take the lead at about three and half miles and he was aided by 
    the fact that the lead vehicle went the wrong way, taking the top two runners, 
    enabling Schmeckpeper to take the lead sooner than expected. &quot;I saw the 
    top two go with the lead vehicle but I knew the course and went the right 
    way&quot;, said Schmeckpeper. He extended his lead and then held on in the 
    final 800 to win by 10 seconds. &quot;It was definitely Ben's top race this 
    season and proved his race at the All New England's was for real&quot;, said 
    Coach Taylor.</p>
  <p align="left">The team is not going to Hanover College next week, but Schmeckpeper 
    is, and he is going to try and improve on his 32nd All American position at 
    last year's Nationals. </p>
