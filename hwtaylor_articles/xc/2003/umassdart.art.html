  <p><strong><font size="4">Harriers Run Poorly, Place 3rd at UMass Dartmouth 
    Invitational</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">September 20, 2003</p>
  <p align="left">MIT men's cross country team traveled to UMass Dartmouth to 
    run their first big race of the season, hoping to see how they stacked up 
    against much of the Division III competition in New England, specifically 
    Tufts University, ranked 2nd regionally and 14th nationally and Amherst College, 
    ranked 4th regionally. MIT, ranked 5th regionally, placed 3rd with 87 points, 
    behind Amherst with 64 and Tufts with 65 (despite not running three of their 
    top runners), but ahead of 6th ranked Trinity College with 133 points.</p>
  <p align="left">Temperatures in the 80s with unseasonably high humidity affected 
    everyone in the races but particularly those who went out too fast. The Tech 
    harriers, anxious to prove they were better than their 5th place ranking, 
    went out too fast for the conditions and paid dearly. The entire latter half 
    of both the varsity and sub-varsity races displayed MIT runners who were more 
    holding on to survive rather than racing to win.</p>
  <p align="left">In the varsity race, Ben Schmeckpeper came through the first 
    mile in 4:54, running with a small pack of runners. Shortly before the end 
    of mile two, Schmeckpeper took the lead and began to pull away, opening up 
    a 20 meter lead halfway through the 3rd mile. Brian Anderson, motivated to 
    do his part in his senior year, started off in 5:02 and moved up to 6th place 
    by the end of the 2nd mile, holding that going up the one hill on the course 
    in mile three. Eric Khatchadourian, John Brewer and Kevin Brulois bit off 
    a more than they could chew with their opening mile of 5:03-5:06. Khatchadourian 
    moved up during mile two, but Brewer and Brulois began to show signs of fatigue.</p>
  <p align="left">Mile three, slightly uphill in grade, is the key to the race. 
    MIT runners were able to maintain at best during this crucial mile. Mile four, 
    which is downhill, is supposed to be the fastest mile. MIT runners were not 
    able to take advantage of this. Schmeckpeper lost his lead, falling back to 
    third. Anderson fell back to 11th place. Katchadourian and Brewer maintained 
    their place in the low 20s, but Brulois fell back to 42nd position.</p>
  <p align="left">In the fifth and final mile, not much changed for MIT. Schmeckpeper 
    held onto his 3rd place, 2nd among collegiate runners, finishing in 25:29. 
    Anderson moved up one place, finishing in 10th in 26:00. Khatchadourian placed 
    21st in 26:31. Brewer lost 17 seconds to Khatchadourian in the final mile, 
    falling back to 26:48 and 25th place. Freshman, Kevin Brulois, placed 41st 
    in 27:16 to round out the MIT scoring.</p>
  <p align="left">The sub-varsity race, the final race of the day and perhaps 
    the hottest, gave MIT a chance to show off the majority of their talented 
    freshman class. Ian Driver took a lesson from Schmeckpeper and took the lead 
    during the second mile after a well paced opening mile of 5:21. Shortly behind 
    Driver in 5:23 were freshmen Robby Bryant, Spencer Dudley, Kevin DiGenova 
    and Sam Berberian. Fighting it out with Tufts army of mostly senior runners, 
    MIT and Tufts soon separated themselves from the rest of the field during 
    the second mile.</p>
  <p align="left">During mile three, Tufts began to show their experience and 
    dominance. Driver fell behind the lead Tufts' runners, but Bryant moved up 
    to a tie for the lead. Mile four was similar to the varsity race with all 
    Tech runners with the exception of Bryant not able to take advantage of the 
    downhill mile. Tufts runners pulled ahead to 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 places at the 
    end of mile four. Mile five, which was basically survival for MIT runners, 
    saw Tufts move into a sweep of the top five places. Bryant held onto 6th place 
    in 27:26. He was closely followd by graduate student, Chris Fidowski in 27:33, 
    Driver in 27:35, Dudley in 27:43 and DiGenova in 27:48 for a 22 second delta.

  <p align="left">Next week, MIT gets another chance to show what they can do 
    if they run smart when they run the regional championship course at Twin Brook 
    Golf Course hosted by Bates College and the University of Southern Maine. 
    Amherst College and Williams College are among those who have declared their 
    intent to compete, giving MIT plenty of competition on the challenging course.</p>
