  <p align="left">November 17, 2007</p>
  <p align="left">After narrowly missing the qualification mark for the NCAA Division III Cross Country National Championship her freshman year in 2005 and working through a season long injury in 2006, Elizabeth Finn placed 20th at the New England Regional meet on November 10th to squeeze into the pack of those chosen to run at the national competition this year. &nbsp; She traveled to St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota this weekend as an individual entrant along with six other individuals and five full teams from New England. &nbsp; In all, 280 women from all over the U.S. competed in the six kilometer championship.</p>
  <p align="left">Light snow dusted the fields surrounding the course on Saturday morning as the athletes arrived. &nbsp; Although the temperature was in the high 30's, the wind made it feel cooler. &nbsp; This encouraged Finn, who originates from Illinois and enjoys running in the snow. &nbsp; Although she started the race with gloves and a homemade headband, she quickly warmed up and tossed them in the bushes. &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Elizabeth knew the competition would be strong, but after reading on the clock that she'd run her first mile in 5:45, she faltered a bit and slowed during her second mile. &nbsp; Realizing her error on a spectator-less loop around a pond, Finn refocused and picked up her pace. &nbsp; Just before the largest hill in the race, she spotted a competitor from Williams she had wanted to beat all year. &nbsp; Quickening her pace, the MIT junior made her move and passed her target; this gave Finn the encouragement to continue pushing for the last two kilometers.</p>
  <p align="left">In the end, Finn placed 100th in the field and did not allow anyone to pass her in the last mile. &nbsp; Her goal was to place in the top 50, but after running the race, she admitted she may have underestimated the other runners. &nbsp; Always looking on the bright side and learning from her experiences, she expressed pleasure at having beaten many of the girls who out raced her the previous week at Regionals. &nbsp; Already anticipating next year's cross country season, she hopes she, along with her team, will qualify for the national championship event. </p>
