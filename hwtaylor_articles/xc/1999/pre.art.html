<P>October 9, 1999</P>

<P>MIT Men's Cross Country team, ranked 13th nationally in Division
III, traveled to Oshkosh, WI this past weekend to race 18 other
teams, 5 of them ranked in the top 10. The course will also be the
site of the National Championships on Nov. 21. Falling victims to an
overly aggressive first mile, the Tech harriers paid dearly in the
final miles on the mostly flat course, finishing 8th behind seven
other nationally ranked teams.</P>

<P>The plan was to go out in about 40th to 50th position for most of
the top 7, and work up to the top 20-30 runners. However, a sprint at
the start, combined with the comfort of a flat course put all 9 under
5:00 at the mile and in the top 35. Dan Feldman '02, led the way up
in the front pack of 5 at 4:47.</P>

<P>By mile two, North Central, Calvin, UW La Crosse, and UW
Whitewater, running more intelligent races, had worked their way up
to MIT. Tech had held on pretty well to this point, running the two
miles in 9:52 to 10:14, but the leading teams were still passing
them.</P>

<P>The third mile was the beginning of the end for Sean Montgomery
'01, Sean Nolan '03, Phil Loiselle '01, and Chris Testa '03 as they
ran miles of 5:17, 5:23, 5:28, and 5:36 respectively. Fortunately,
Feldman, Ed Keehr '01, Chris McGuire '00, Liyan Guo '01, and Frank
Johnston '00, were still holding on in spite of the obvious pain.</P>

<P>The fourth mile, the most difficult on the course, had UW Oshkosh
steadily pass the Engineers to move into 6th place. Haverford
College, which also started out too quickly, seemed to have a greater
threshold for pain or at least a greater desire to win, stayed ahead
of MIT to lay claim to 7th place. MIT seemed to running backward at
this point, as opposing runners continued to pass. </P>

<P>The final mile was a bit of a rally for Tech, which probably
indicates a lack of focus during the 3rd and 4th miles. Dan Feldman,
ran a great race in his first race of this caliber, finishing 11th in
25:05 in the quality field. Also running well were Keehr 25:40,
McGuire 25:43, and Guo 26:02. Liyan seemed to run the smartest race
of the Tech 9 with a :29 variance from his fastest to slowest
mile.</P>

<P>Next Friday, MIT gets the opportunity to make amends when they
race in the all division New England Championship at Franklin
Park.</P>
