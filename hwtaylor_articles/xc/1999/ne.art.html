CHAMPIONSHIPS</B></FONT>

runs well</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>October 15, 1999</P>

<P>Finishing a second consecutive week where pulling an all-nighter,
or close to it, was the rule rather than the exception, Phil
Loiselle's cold would not go away, Sean Montgomery had his second
bike accident in as many weeks and developed a mild infection, and Ed
Keehr slept 16 hours for the previous four nights. Nevertheless, the
varsity, minus #3 Montgomery, and #4 Loiselle, persevered, and all
but one ran personal bests on Franklin Park's course to bring their
team to an 11th place finish in the All Division New England Cross
Country Championships.</P>

<P>Making certain they did not get "pulled out" too fast running
against the Division I faster runners, the MIT harriers followed the
game plan, going out in the first mile between 4:47 for Feldman to
5:06 for Guo and Johnston. Although this caused Guo and Johnston to
have to spend a lot of energy in the first mile getting around
opposing runners who went out too fast, overall it paid huge
dividends.</P>

<P>Dan Feldman led the way despite spraining his ankle pretty badly
on Tuesday during an interval workout. Taped up, Dan ran an
aggressive but intelligent race to finish 19th in 24:56. Based on how
his fellow Division III competitors fared (5 in top 15), Dan has to
feel good about how he will run when his ankle is healed.</P>

<P>Ed Keehr, somehow managing to put his personal best together
despite very little sleep this week, finished in 62nd place with a
25:45. There is no doubt Ed would have finished significantly higher
had he been a little more rested.</P>

<P>Having the best race of his life, Liyan Guo, fought from the back
thirty or so runners going into the first turn, to finish 76th in the
field of over 270 runners. Liyan's time of 25:54 is his best ever on
any course. Even with that, he was able to finish with a very strong
4th and 5th mile, indicating he still has more improvement to
come.</P>

<P>Captain Chris McGuire, ran with Ed for half of the race, but was
behind by :04 at the 3 mile mark. Chris continued his improvement
with a strong, evenly paced race, which helped him break 26:00 with a
25:58 for 82nd place. Chris will probably be in the top 2 on the team
at the end of the season as he always is.</P>

<P>The most evenly paced race has to go to Frank Johnston. Frank
deviated only :21 from his fastest to slowest mile, an unusual feat
in cross country. Frank was also tired from lack of sleep and
increasing his mileage this week. Nevertheless, the senior put his
head down and ran his best time ever at Franklin Park with a 26:18
for 117th place to round out the scoring for MIT.</P>

<P>Stepping in to take Sean Montgomery's place was #14 runner,
Stanley Hu. Stan, a senior, wanted one more opportunity to run a PR
at Franklin Park. Stan came through, running 28:37 for 247th.</P>

<P>The Tech runners showed that they have the desire to succeed under
very adverse circumstances. They will need this and more to qualify
for Nationals at the end of the season. There are seven strong teams
in New England with a chance to win one of the five spots awarded our
region to go to the National Championships. Next week, MIT takes
another step toward improving at the Tufts' Invitational at 2:00 on
Saturday at the Grafton course.</P>
