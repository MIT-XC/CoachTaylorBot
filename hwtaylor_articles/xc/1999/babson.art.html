<P>October 2, 1999</P>

<P>MIT's 10th-17th runners took to the trails on Saturday to see how
many varsity teams they could beat. Their quest took them to the top
half of the field as they finished 12th out of 28 teams. Led by
freshman Albert Liu (47th), Tech started out slow in the back half of
the field and moved their way up to finish with outstanding
performances.</P>

<P>The first mile was perhaps a little slow for MIT, but most of the
rest of the field was a little too anxious to cover the 1st mile.
Albert, Mark Jeunnette '01, and Kenny Walker '01, were back in about
120th position at the 1/2 mile mark. They were followed by George
Hanson '03, Stanley Hu '00, and David Bailey '02 about 25 people
back, and Yuval Mazor '02, and Alan Raphael '02, 10 or so more
runners behind.</P>

<P>By the 2 mile, Albert had already pulled away from Mark and Kenny
in his attempt to catch the other runners. Kenny and Mark continued
to work together as they also picked off their opponents. George and
Stanley were about 9 seconds back, but running very well together
with David only a step behind.</P>

<P>At mile 3, Albert had pulled over :20 ahead of Mark and Kenny, and
running a very aggressive race. Mark and Kenny were still together
but had moved up very little in this mile. Stanley and George were
almost up to their teammates ahead as they ran a very good mile.
David had fallen off the aggressive 3rd mile of his teammates and was
begin caught by Yuval.</P>

<P>Mile 4 proved to be the slowest of the day for all the Engineers,
but most kept it to within :40 of their fastest mile, which was the
very flat 1st mile. Albert gained another :15 on his teammates as he
continued to move up in the field. Mark had begun to pull away from
Kenny as he started to feel more confident knowing the finish way
getting near. George ran a very strong 4th mile, catching and passing
Stanley. Yuval caught David, and they began to work together to beat
opposing runners.</P>

<P>At the finish, Tech continued to pass people in the home stretch.
After Albert's fine performance, which would put him in most team's
top 5, Jeunnette finished 75th, Walker 82nd, Hanson 86th, and Hu 93rd
to round out the scoring for MIT. Mazor finished his best cross
country race ever in 98th as he passed Bailey (99th) at the finish.
Raphael, also having his best race ever finished 105th.</P>

<P>The top 9 did not race so that they could put in a week of extra
hard training and give the others a chance to race in the varsity
section of the meet. Next week, the top 9 fly out to Wisconsin to
race in the National Preview meet against most of the top teams in
the country.</P>
