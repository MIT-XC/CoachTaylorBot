CONSECUTIVE TIME</B></FONT>

<P>&nbsp;</P></CENTER>

<P>September 25, 1999</P>

<P>It is not clear whether the MIT Men's Cross Country Team is
overachieving, or if they are determined to reach their competitive
potential, but whichever it is, collectively, they ran a very
inspired race to defend their Codfish Bowl title at Tufts' Grafton
course with a low score of 56 points to defeat nationally ranked
Tufts (14th), and Brandeis (15th), who had 86 and 94 points
respectively.</P>

<P>The course is very hilly with one of the hills coming 100 metes
into the race, which tends to keep those with experience from going
out too fast. However, the course also narrows pretty quickly and has
a narrow starting area to begin with, at least for 225 runners. Given
the choice of sitting back and getting swallowed by the mass of
runners, or going out aggressively and risking death on the course,
those teams who hope to win usually pick the latter.</P>

<P>MIT certainly decided on the aggressive approach, to the point
that Coach Halston Taylor was envisioning a fade comparable to having
runners try to race with open parachutes on their back. Dan Feldman
'02, expecting to contend for the individual title, went out with the
leaders, but had the sense to sit at the back or that pack for the
first mile, which was in a very fast 4:57. The second pack of Tech
runners, which included Ed Keehr '01, Sean Montgomery '01, Chris
McGuire '00, Phil Loiselle '01, and Frank Johnston '00, began the
race in about 30th position on the first hill, but had already made
their way into 20th place by the mile mark as they came through in
5:07. A third group, all freshmen, led by Sean Nolan, were more
conservative at the mile mark with a 5:20 time, but were already
beginning to separate.</P>

<P>The second mile saw the front pack of runners separate as the fast
early pace began to take its toll on those who were ill prepared for
such aggressive racing. Feldman, along with Samson Yohannes from
Brandeis, and Matt Lyons from Tufts had separated themselves from the
rest of the field and were pulling away with each step, which was
indicated by their continued torrid pace of 10:00. Keehr and
Montgomery had moved into the top 15 at 2 miles (10:19), but seemed
to be dissatisfied with that position. McGuire, Loiselle, and
Johnston were still in about 20th, but maintaining their pace well at
10:23. Nolan and Testa '03, had fallen back some in time (10:46), but
were maintaining a great pace and were moving up through the sea of
runners.</P>

<P>The third mile is the slowest on the course, in part because of
the aggressive early running, but also because of the many turns
combined with the changes in elevation. This fact was consistent with
the Engineers, but the time deviation was minimal. Feldman had taken
the lead on Yohannes, and Lyons had fallen off the pace a bit as they
came through in 15:28. Keehr had moved into the top 10 with a three
mile split of 15:59. Montgomery had fallen asleep at the wheel and
fallen back by :02. McGuire, Loiselle, and Johnston were still
together and maintaining their position with a split of 16:12.
Meanwhile, Nolan had begun to move up significantly within the pack
of runners, and for the first time had a mile split faster than
McGuire's group. It was beginning to look as though the Tech runners
were not going to fade at all. However, Tufts and Brandeis were still
very much in this race.</P>

<P>At mile four, Feldman was still in the lead, but Yohannes looked a
bit too comfortable for Dan to feel secure about his lead. Keehr was
making a move on the top 5 with a vicious 4th mile of 5:22.
Montgomery continued to doze, which is expected when someone who is
primarily a middle distance track runner takes a race out so
aggressively, and fell :14 behind Ed, but he did maintain his
position in the top 15. McGuire, who had been fluctuating from the
front to the back and in-between within his group, moved ahead of
Loiselle by :01 and Johnston by :04. Nolan continued his move to the
front with a 5:20 mile 4, which moved him to within :10 of Johnston
and into the top 30. MIT was all but home free.</P>

<P>Coming into the finish, MIT continued to pass people. Yohannes
made a big move and pulled ahead of Feldman, winning the race by :07
in 25:53, just :12 off the course record. Keehr had another strong
mile and nearly got 4th place, settling for 5th in 26:39. McGuire
briefly caught up to Montgomery, woke him up by telling him to get
going, and finished :07 behind in 16th place. Montgomery finished
strong and moved up to 12th with a time of 27:01. Loiselle was only
:08 behind in 21st. Nolan passed Johnston and finished in 23rd with a
time of 27:22. Sean was the 2nd Division III freshman finisher in the
race. Johnston was only :02 behind in 25th place. Chris Testa faded a
bit, but held on pretty well to finish in 35th with a time of 27:53.
Liyan Guo '01, perhaps overworked in practice this week, had a tough
outing, finishing in 45th with a 28:35. Albert Liu '03, fell off the
pace of his group early, but kept a good pace throughout in finishing
65th with a time of 28:35. Kenny Walker '01, was the final Tech
finisher in 78th out of 225 registering a time of 28:52.</P>

<P>Next week, the top 9 are taking a breather before traveling to
Wisconsin for the National Preview Meet on the 9th. The 10-17 runners
will compete at the Babson Invitational this coming weekend at Babson
College.</P>
