Not only did the Engineers                     compete for the victories, but they walked away, make that                     ran away, with three of the four races, totally dominating                     both sub-varsity races and the varsity women sneaking in ahead                     of NCAA Division III number one ranked, and defending national                     champion, Amherst for the victory. Only the varsity men were                     unable to gain the victory, settling for third behind Keene                     State and Coast Guard.</p>                  <p align="left">Race time temperatures were hovering in the                     low 70's but the sun was intense. The first race on the docket                     was the men's sub varsity race. The start of the race had                     Keene State up front with MIT mixed in and a little behind                     as they came through the mile mark in a fairly quick 5:06.                     At the two mile mark, freshmen John LaColla and Andrew Erickson                     had taken over the lead and appeared on their way to victory.                     Perhaps the pace was a little quick for the rookies for the                     slight uphill grade in mile three took its toll on the freshmen.                     Senior co-captain, Chris Wong, moved up to fourth position                     at the four mile mark, followed closely by LaColla and Trevor                     Rundell '09. MIT continued to move up spots as Keene State                     continued to fade. At the finish Wong maintained his fourth                     place in 26:11 while LaColla moved up to seventh in 26:15.                     Rundell held onto ninth in 26:19 while Erickson came back                     to claim 10th in 26:26. Sophomore Richard Prevost finished                     in 11th at 26:28 to give MIT a commanding victory among the                     20 teams with 41 points.</p>                  <p align="left">In the men's varsity race, MIT was running without                     number one runner, Jake Ruzevick '09, but was nevertheless                     ready to do battle with some of the top New England Division                     III teams. There were 38 teams competing in the race with                     two division I teams and two division II teams. The pace was                     relatively slow on the flat course, coming through the mile                     in 5:04. MIT was in good shape with Paul Welle '11 in fourth                     and Yermie Cohen '09 in 5th as well as Gihan Amarasiriwardena                     '11in 23rd, Dan Harper '12 in 27th, Bill Phipps '10 in 35th,                     Kevin Kleinguetl '11 in 45th and Hemu Arumugam '10 in 56th                     position. By the two mile mark the leaders came through in                     10:14 and MIT runners were bunched between sixth and thirty                     fifth place, but Coast Guard was bunched up in front of MIT                     and Keene State was uncharacteristically moving up from behind.                     The third and fourth miles were not good to MIT as Cohen and                     Welle faded a bit. Arumugam moved up well and eventually captured                     13th place in 25:25. Welle held on to 19th in 25:32, Cohen                     continued to lose ground but finished in 25th place in 25:34,                     Amarasiriwardena was right behind in 27th place in 25:36 and                     Dan Harper came back after losing focus in the previous two                     miles to claim 34th in 25:49. The 118 points placed MIT three                     points behind conference rival Coast Guard in third place.                     Winner Keene State easily won with 85 points.</p>                  <p align="left">Next, the varsity women took to the starting                     line. 41 teams toed the line with defending national champion                     the headliner. At the mile mark, Jacqui Wentz '10 led the                     way for MIT in seventh place in 5:48 with Adrienne Bolger                     '09 in 16th position, Katy Gordon '11 in 20th, Anna Holt-Gosselin                     in 25th and Jennifer Doyle '09 in 36th. Amherst College runners                     were bunched between 45th and 55th place, appearing to just                     cruise the early part of the race. By mile two MIT had moved                     up to third, 10th, 11th 14th, 25th, 27th and 29th place. Amherst's                     entire group was right behind in 30th-36th place. At the finish                     MIT held on for the victory despite the fast closing Amherst                     runners. Wentz finished fourth overall in 18:30. She was followed                     by Bolger in 12th in 18:44, Holt-Gosselin in 15th in 18:51,                     Jennifer Doyle in 18th in 18:54 and Andrea Bradshaw '09, a                     rookie to cross country, in 18:57 for 23rd place. Amherst                     moved up significantly, claiming second, ninth, 10th and 19th                     but their number five runner faded to 53rd. </p>                  <p align="left">The final race of the day was the women's sub-varsity                     race. This race held no surprises as MIT went out into the                     lead and kept it. Alicia Kaestli '12 led until the two mile                     mark with a fine split of 12:10. She was followed by fellow                     freshman, Tania Morimoto in fourth place, another freshman,                     Katherine Eve in seventh and Liz Labuz '09 in eighth. Amherst                     College was coming on strong to challenge MIT but was unsuccessful.                     At the finish, Kaestli fell back to third in 19:19, while                     Morimoto got nipped at the line to finish in fourth in 19:26.                     Eve was right behind in fifth in 19:29 and Labuz holding on                     for 12th in 19:47 and freshman Maggie Lloyd finishing strong                     for 13th place in 19:49. The final score was MIT 35 to 50                     for Amherst in the 18 team field.</p>                  <p align="left">Next week, MIT will travel to Williams College                     to see the course that will be host to the NCAA Regional Qualifier.                     The pre-national meet will be in two weeks and those making                     that trip will not race at Williams, giving them a much needed                     break from racing.</p>                                  </div>              </div></td>          </tr>          <tr>             <td>&nbsp;</td>            <td>&nbsp;</td>          </tr>        </table></td>    </tr>  </table>  </div></body></html>
