  <p><strong><span class="style1">Monks and Ruzevick Find Running
    Difficult in the Mud</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">November 18, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">The conditions on the course at Voice of America Park were
    the worst any coach could remember for an <a href="ncaa.res.html">NCAA Division
    III Championship</a>,
    easily surpassing the 1997 meet hosted by MIT at Franklin Park and earlier
    meets hosted by Fredonia State in the snow and Washington University of St.
    Louis in the mud.&nbsp; The mud was on every inch of the course and could
    suck the shoe off a runner's foot at any point.&nbsp; Many of the top ranked
    teams for the men and women were unable to deal with the conditions while
    some seemed to handle the race well, albeit much slower than normal.</p>
  <p align="left">For MIT runners, freshman Maria Monks and sophomore Jake Ruzevick,
    both running at nationals for the first time, the going was difficult but
    for different reasons.&nbsp; For Monks, her poor luck continued to plague
    her in her debut season as someone stepped on her heel in the first 100 meters
    and pulled her shoe off.&nbsp; Not being certain if the timing chip in her
    shoe laces were necessary to have an official finish, Monks stopped to go
    back and get the shoe, putting her in last place and negating her nice start.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">Monks worked her way up through the pack methodically with
    shoe in hand.&nbsp; With
    the exception of the rocky roads she had to occasionally cross, Monks ran
    quite well.&nbsp; By the two mile mark she was up to 130th position and eventually
    finished in 98th place with a time of 24:54 for the 6K course, 2:23 behind
    the winner, Sarah Zerzan from Willamette College. </p>
  <p align="left">Ruzevick got out to a desirable spot in the first mile but
    was simply unable to hold on to that position.&nbsp; The mud sapped the speed
    and strength from his legs, making finishing the race challenge enough.&nbsp; By
    the two mile mark, Ruzevick had fallen to 98th place.&nbsp; By four miles
    he was in 148th place and eventually finished in 151st place of the 280 runners
    in the race with a time of 29:00, 2:29 behind winner, Macharia Yuot of Widener
    College. </p>
  <p align="left">This ends the 2006 season but being so early in their college
    careers, both Ruzevick and Monks should improve significantly in future NCAA
    Championships.</p>
