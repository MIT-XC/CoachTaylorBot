    Competition in Engineer's Cup</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">September 9, 2006 </p>
  <p align="left">After three weeks of unseasonably cool weather, the heat returned
    with a vengence today in the <a href="engineer's.res.html">Engineer's Cup</a>.&nbsp; The 85 degree temperatures
    affected everyone's performances but not the inevitable outcome of MIT finishing
    on top of their fellow engineers from RPI and WPI.&nbsp; In the men's race,
    the men from Cambridge nearly swept their competition, finishing 1-2-3-4-7
    for a 17 point victory over 54 for RPI and 71 for WPI for their 10th consecutive
    victory in this meet.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT went out hard for the first mile and took most of the competition
    with them.&nbsp; By mile two there were only a few remaining competitors,
    four from RPI and one from WPI to break up MIT's top 12 runners.&nbsp; Jake
    Ruzevick and Kevin Brulois had taken control of the lead by mile two.&nbsp; The
    third mile saw Ruzevick pull away from Brulois and the Alex White from WPI
    move up to third.&nbsp; One of the RPI runners fell back leaving three betwenn
    MIT's top 15.&nbsp; The trend continued in the fourth mile.&nbsp; Brandon
    Pung and Joe Roy-Mayhew passed White to give MIT their 1-2-3-4 advantage
    and Trevor Rundell seemed to be closing in on fifth.</p>
  <p align="left">At the finish it was obvious the heat had taken its toll with
    times running 30 to 60 seconds slower than the week before when temperatures
    were 20 degrees lower.&nbsp; Ruzevick finished first in 26:30.&nbsp; MIT's
    delta for 1-5 was :57 and 1-7 was 1:10.&nbsp; The harriers from MIT need
    to improve at handling the heat as well as a fast early pace if they are
    going to fair well against the better teams from New England.</p>
  <p align="left">The women seemed to handle the heat much better than their
    male counterparts.&nbsp; The predicted close finish among the three teams
    never materialized as MIT quite literally ran away with an easy victory despite
    a few top runners being out with sickness and injury.&nbsp; Once the dust
    had settled, MIT finished with 21 points to 46 for RPI and 72 for WPI.</p>
  <p align="left">At the mile mark, Maria Monks and Jacqui Wentz from MIT were
    locked in a battle with Cathy Molloy and Lauren Carter from RPI.&nbsp; A
    WPI runner was a little behind and then three more RPI runners and one WPI
    runner were mixed in and just ahead of a group of five MIT runners.&nbsp; WPI
    appeared out of contention but the anticipated battle between RPI and MIT
    was taking shape.</p>
  <p align="left">Monks put the hammer down in the second mile and totally opened
    up the race.&nbsp; Molloy was able to stay about 10 seconds back at the two
    mile mark with Wentz just five seconds behind.&nbsp; The biggest change was
    the fact that three more MIT runners (Hana Adaniya, Alisha Schor and Jennifer
    Doyle) had passed all other runners to give MIT a commanding lead.</p>
  <p align="left">In the final mile Carter of RPI had passed two MIT runners
    to get back to fifth place.&nbsp; Doyle had moved up to fourth in 19:55 for
    her first sub-20:00 performance.&nbsp; Adrienne Bolger and Elizabeth Finn
    joined Adaniya and Schor to finish 6-7-8-9, putting seven ahead of RPI's
    third runner and sweeping WPI.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT travels to Twinbrook cross country course in
    Cumberland, Maine to race host Bates, Keene State and Southern Maine.   </p>
