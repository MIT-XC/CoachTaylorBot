  <p><strong><span class="style1">Tech Runners Experience Mixed
    Results at Plansky Invitational</span></strong></p>
  <p align="left">October 14, 2006</p>
  <p align="left">The MIT men's and women's cross country teams traveled to Williams
    College to run in the <a href="plansky.res.html">Plansky Invitational</a>, hosted on the nearby Mt. Greylock
    High School course.&nbsp; The race distances were intentionally short; 4K
    for the women and 6K for the men.&nbsp; As teams approach the end of the
    season, an opportunity to get out of the rut of running the same distances
    week after week and race a slightly faster pace is an attractive one.</p>
  <p align="left">With just having run a major race the week before and with
    the conference championship two weeks away, the team welcomed the shorter
    distance and the opportunity to run against powerhouses, Williams and Tufts
    on the women's side and Williams on the men's side.&nbsp; Both men's and
    women's teams finished third and for different reasons look forward to the
    conference championship in two weeks at Mt. Holyoke College. </p>
  <p align="left">The women had a choice of running a 5K or 4K race.&nbsp; Williams
    and Tufts split up their teams but running more of their better runners in
    the 4K. MIT, running without their freshmen, number one and two runners,
    Maria Monks and Jacqui Wentz.&nbsp; The remaining varsity runners accepted
    the challenge of taking up the slack and performed very well.&nbsp; Elizabeth
    Finn, still getting in top form after a very low mileage summer, hung behind
    MIT lead runners, Jennifer Doyle and Hana Adaniya until the end when she
    out sprinted both to the finish line to finish seventh with a fine time of
    15:15.&nbsp; Doyle
    was right behind at 15:15.  Adaniya, bothered by stomach problems, was unable
    to finish as strong, running 15:22, but finishing ninth.&nbsp; Rachel Niehuus
    continued to race well, finishing tenth in 15:23. Alisha Schor closed out
    the scoring with a 19th place finish in 15:48.</p>
  <p align="left">At the conference championship MIT intends on being at full
    strength and will need to do so to upset last year's champion, Wellesley
    College.&nbsp; Also looking very good are last year's second place team,
    Wheaton College as well as much improved Coast Guard Academy.</p>
  <p align="left">The men had only one choice, the 6K race.&nbsp; Finishing only
    four points behind Williams last week in the New England Championships, it
    was logical to think the Engineers could run with the Ephs.&nbsp; Williams
    College, last week running without Stephen Wills, was at full strength and
    had a message to deliver.&nbsp; MIT runners, with the exception of star sophomore,
    Jake Ruzevick, never seemed in contention.&nbsp; Ruzevick suffered a quadriceps
    strain halfway through the race and just tried to hang on without further
    damage.&nbsp; The rest of the varsity runners never challenged the Williams
    leaders, letting them go at the start.&nbsp; The message sent by Williams
    was received loud and clear, they are still the team to go through if you
    want to win the New England Division III Championship in four weeks.</p>
  <p align="left">For the immediate future, MIT will attempt to remain the only
    team to ever win the NEWMAC, going for their ninth consecutive title.&nbsp; The
    perennial challenger to the crown remains the Coast Guard Academy.&nbsp; Tech
    knows it must compete much better in two weeks if they hope to keep the upset
    minded Coast Guard team at bay.</p>
