  <p align="left">Seeded sixth going into the <a href="ncaa-reg.res.html">NCAA 
    Division III Regional Qualifier</a> hosted by Springfield College at the Veteran's 
    Golf Course, MIT ran true to their ranking, but did it in a most unexpected 
    way. Tufts University defended their title and number one seed by finishing 
    with a low score total of 62 points. Running a very inspired race, Wesleyan 
    University surprised some people by finishing second, just ahead of Keene 
    State and Williams with 118 points to 132 and 139 respectively. The top three 
    teams move on to the NCAA Championships being held next weekend at Ohio Wesleyan 
    University.</p>
  <p align="left">Veteran's Golf Course presented a constantly rolling, winding 
    course for the 49 teams entered in the race. Overall, the course had no large 
    hills so the thought of most runners was to get out pretty hard, particularly 
    with the relatively narrow starting area, which only allowed each team to 
    put two members on the front line. MIT followed that thought process and did 
    get out relatively hard, moving their way up towards the front by the half 
    mile mark.</p>
  <p align="left">At the mile mark, captains Fivos Constantinou '06 and Eric Khatchadourian 
    '06, looked to be taking care of business as they have all season as both 
    were among the top ten runners. Kevin Brulois '07, who stopped for a couple 
    of seconds to put his shoe back on, and Jake Ruzevick '09 were also up close, 
    running in the top 20. By the two mile mark there was some concern as both 
    Constantinou and Khatchadourian, while running a fast second mile split, had 
    fallen off the lead pack and looked to be having some difficulty although 
    they were still in the top 20. Brulois and Ruzevick seemed comfortable and 
    were maintaining their position in the top 30. Trevor Rundell '09, who had 
    gone out with Spencer Dudley '07 and Erik Stafl '08, was moving up in the 
    crowd, running the same split as Brulois.</p>
  <p align="left">The third mile seemed to be marked a little long because everyone 
    seemed to run a slower split but did not seem to be slowing down. Constantinou 
    and Khatchadourian however were slowing down, losing more than ten seconds 
    to Brulois and falling back past 40th place. Ruzevick was running aggressively, 
    staying in the top 30. Rundell continued to move up, now just a few seconds 
    behind Constantinou.</p>
  <p align="left">Typically in a relatively flat 8k race their is little change 
    in the places in the race after three and a half miles. The fourth mile was 
    crucial to MIT to see if Constantinou and Khatchadourian could hold on to 
    their current position and if Rundell could continue to move up. Brulois moved 
    up slightly to 24th position and Ruzevick ran just as hard. Rundell ran just 
    a couple of seconds off their pace, moving just past Constantinou who seemed 
    to recover a little bit. Khatchadourian faded back to around 60th position, 
    11 seconds behind Rundell and Constantinou.</p>
  <p align="left">At the finish Brulois sprinted home in 22nd place, eight places 
    and :17 away from making nationals on an individual basis. Ruzevick ran a 
    great race as a freshman, finishing in 27th position. The race of the day 
    had to be by Rundell, running a personal best time of 26:35 and placing 40th. 
    Constantinou lost a little time but only two places, finishing in 43rd place. 
    Khatchadourian recovered a little in the final mile, moving up to 54th position 
    to give MIT a total of 186 points, six points behind fifth place Bowdoin College, 
    but four points ahead of Connecticut College and six ahead of Middlebury College.</p>
  <p align="left">For the first time since 2000 MIT will not be sending anyone 
    to the NCAA Championship. The team will lose the services of Constantinou 
    and Khatchadourian due to graduation but should regain the services of Chris 
    Bruce and Chris Wong, two sophomores who had run very well as freshmen.</p>
