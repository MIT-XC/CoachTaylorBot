  <p><strong><font size="+3">MIT RACES TO 8TH CONSECUTIVE NEWMAC CHAMPIONSHIP</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">October 29, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">MIT successfully defended their <a href="newmac.res.html">NEWMAC</a> 
    Cross Country title yesterday at the challenging Smith College course in Northampton, 
    MA. Led by senior Eric Khatchadourian the MIT harriers placed 2, 3, 5, 6, 
    9 to total 25 points to runner-up Coast Guard's 33 points. The two perennial 
    rivals were followed by Springfield with 73, WPI with 140, Clark at 163, Babson 
    close behind at 166 and Wheaton closing out the scoring with 168 points.</p>
  <p align="left">The hilly course offers everything a challenging cross country 
    course should offer; change of terrain, sharp turns, quick transition from 
    uphill to downhill and at times, tricky footing. Although the weather called 
    for rain mixed with snow, the runners toed the line with sun mixed with some 
    clouds and the temperature in the low 40s.</p>
  <p align="left">Due to the difficulty of the course, the MIT plan was to run 
    a conservative first mile, stay behind Coast Guard, work up to Coast Guard 
    over the next mile and a half and then move hard in the second half of the 
    race. The only problem with this was that the normally aggressive Coast Guard 
    runners had the same plan. MIT proved the more disciplined in this effort 
    although with Coast Guard also running a conservative first mile the plan 
    to move in the latter stages of the race proved less effective.</p>
  <p align="left">Khatchadourian, Kevin Brulois '07, Fivos Constantinou '06, Jake 
    Ruzevick '09 and Spencer Dudley '07 trailed the top five Coast Guard runners 
    by a couple of seconds at the mile mark. Springfield College, running a surprisingly 
    aggressive first mile, was in the lead with their entire top seven. By mile 
    two, Mike Flint of Coast Guard had opened up a 13 second lead. Khatchadourian 
    was leading the MIT charge, who were content to run the plan. The other Coast 
    Guard runners could not go with Flint and had strung out a bit, but overall 
    were still leading the race. Springfield now only had three runners in the 
    mix.</p>
  <p align="left">By mile four, Khatchadourian had broken away from Brulois by 
    five seconds and had closed the gap to Flint to four seconds. Constantinou 
    and Ruzevick were 10 seconds behind Khatchadourian along with a Coast Guard 
    runner. Another Coastie was right behind them. Dudley had fallen off the pace 
    a bit, :18 behind his teammates with two Coast Guard runners within five seconds 
    of him. The race was in hand but not over.</p>
  <p align="left">Working hard over the final mile, Khatchadourian was not quite 
    able to catch Flint, losing by eight seconds in 26:08. Brulois held on for 
    third in 26:21 but Laurel of Coast Guard outkicked Constantinou (26:27) and 
    Ruzevick (26:31) for fourth. Yandell from Coast Guard maintained seventh place 
    and after Hepper from Springfield, Dudley held off the Persun and Newton of 
    Coast Guard in 26:55 to secure the team victory. Just one second behind Newton 
    was freshman Trevor Rundell (26:59), continuing to improve after his mid-season 
    injury. Also joining his teammates on the all-conference squad was Joe Roy-Mayhew 
    '08, in 13th place, just four seconds behind Rundell in 27:03.</p>
  <p align="left">In two weeks the Engineers travel to Springfield College for 
    the NCAA Division III Regional Qualifying Meet at Veteran's Golf Course on 
    November 12 at noon. The top three teams and next seven individuals will advance 
    to the NCAA Division III Championship at Ohio Wesleyan University. MIT, ranked 
    8th in the region, will do well to improve on that mark. Individually, any 
    of MIT's top four could have a big day and advance though it will probably 
    take a finish in the top 15-20 overall to make the trip to Ohio.</p>
