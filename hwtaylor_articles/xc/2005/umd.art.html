  <p><strong><font size="+3">CONSTANTINOU LEADS ENGINEERS IN UMASS DARTMOUTH INVITATIONAL</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">September 17, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">The course was relatively slow due to part of the course being 
    soggy from all the rain the day before, but the competition was anything but 
    slow at the <a href="umd.res.html">UMass Dartmouth Invitational</a>. Fivos 
    Constantinou continued to show that he has added cross country success to 
    his resume as he led MIT to an eighth place finish in the 33 team field. Constantinou 
    ran 25:35 for a personal best, finishing 13th overall and seventh among collegiate 
    athletes.</p>
  <p align="left">MIT held out three of their top five runners, Kevin Brulois 
    and Eric Khatchadourian, in order not to over race them and Trevor Rundell, 
    who is nursing a minor injury. Despite the loss of top finishers, the Engineers, 
    ran and competed well. Nearly everyone on the team ran a controlled, well 
    paced race and as a result, many ran personal best times despite the wet conditions.</p>
  <p align="left">Freshman, Jake Ruzevick, ran a very good race, running with 
    Constantinou through 2 1/2 miles before falling back. Nevertheless, Ruzevick 
    placed 19th overall and was the top freshman among the collegiate runners 
    with a time of 25:53.</p>
  <p align="left">In the sub-varsity race, Brian Jacokes ran an outstanding race. 
    Jacokes placed fifth after moving up in the field throughout the first three 
    miles. Jacokes was followed by teammates Steve Nicholson in eighth, Tyler 
    Abrams in ninth, Rocco Repetski in 18th and Matt Bieniosek in 19th to earn 
    second place as a team among the 15 teams competing in this race.</p>
  <p align="left">Next week, MIT will run everyone healthy enough to do so at 
    the Jumbo Invitational hosted by Tufts University at their Grafton, Massachusetts 
    course. The men's race will start at 1:00.</p>
