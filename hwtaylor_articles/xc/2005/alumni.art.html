  <p><strong><font size="+2">VARSITY DEFEAT ALUMNI IN 100TH ANNIVERSARY MEET</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">September 3, 2005</p>
  <p align="left">2005 marks the 100th anniversary of cross country at MIT. In 
    honor of the event, many alumni came back to Cambridge to celebrate and take 
    part in the <a href="alumni.res.html">annual 
    race</a> against the varsity. Ben Schmeckpeper, one season removed from his 
    varsity days, easily handled the varsity runners, winning by nine seconds 
    with a time of 25:56 on a 80 degree, sunny day at Franklin Park. The alumni, 
    even up with the varsity through two runners, put their three, four, five 
    runners in just after the varsity's, resulting in a 23 to 32 loss.</p>
  <p align="left">At the start of the race there was no doubt the alumni were 
    in this race for the win. Schmeckpeper and Dan Feldman took the lead and pushed 
    the pace through a 4:54 first mile. Terry McNatt followed the varsity's second 
    group and a large group of alums, including Chris Fidkowski, Jesse Darly, 
    Eugene Tung, Carlos Renjifo and Bob Collins closely followed. At mile one 
    the alumni had eight runners in front of the varsity's seventh man.</p>
  <p align="left">At mile two, Schmeckpeper and Feldman maintained their lead. 
    The varsity still held the next five places but McNatt had fallen off the 
    pace a little. Renjifo and Fidkowski had separated themselves from the rest 
    of the varsity to set the stage for the rest of the race. If Schmeckpeper 
    and Feldman could hold off Fivos Constantinou and Kevin Brulois then the three 
    alums would need to move up and break up the varsity threesome of Eric Khatchadourian, 
    Jake Ruzevick and Trevor Rundell.</p>
  <p align="left">By mile three, Feldman was falling back from Schmeckpeper and 
    Constantinou and Brulois were only three seconds behind. The alumni threesome 
    were now 14 seconds behind the varsity trio. The alumni were banking on the 
    fact that the varsity's fourth and fifth runners were both freshmen and may 
    crack in their inaugural 8K race.</p>
  <p align="left">At mile four, Feldman had fallen to fourth but the freshmen 
    fell away from Khatchadourian and Fidkowski and Renjifo had closed to within 
    eight seconds of Rundell and 14 seconds behind Ruzevick. Throughout the last 
    mile Fidkowski closed the gap but ended up five seconds behind Ruzevick and 
    two seconds behind Rundell. Renjifo could not close and McNatt showed a lot 
    of game keeping Kevin DiGenova of the varsity from catching him in the final 
    straight.</p>
  <p align="left">Using the <a href="alumni.res-age.html">age graded tables</a>, 
    the Alumni were able to squeeze out a 26-29 victory. Sumner Brown '66, moved 
    up from 42nd to 5th place and Terry McNatt '87, moved up from 10th to 6th 
    to push Khatchadourian back to seventh and give the &quot;Has Beens&quot; 
    a well earned victory.</p>
