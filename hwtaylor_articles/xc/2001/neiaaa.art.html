OUTING IN NEW ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIP</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>October 12, 2001</P>

<P>Maybe it was taking a week off from racing after competing for
five consecutive weekends, or perhaps the fact that most had a class
earlier in the morning or maybe it was just a lack of proper mental
preparation. Whatever it was, MIT's men's cross country team did not
do as well as expected. However, Dan Feldman and Sean Nolan ran good
races given the 75 degree temperatures and the suffocating dirt
stirred up by the runners on the extremely dry course.</P>

<P>MIT placed 12th out of 42 schools, placing 3rd amond Division III
schools in the NEIAAA Championship, otherwise known as the All New
England Championship. Ranked 15th in the country among Division III
schools before race time and 4th in New England, MIT did slightly
better than expected by their opposing teams, but not as well as they
would have liked. A normal delta of 1:30 for runners 1-5, Tech could
do no better than 2:13, causing them to lose approximately 50 points
by that factor alone.</P>

<P>Feldman got pulled out to an early quick pace of 4:41 for the 1st
mile, but was wise enough to stay well behind the leaders, who went
out in 4:24. Nolan, possibly intuitively expecting the heat to have
some effect, went out a little slower than planned, coming through in
4:56. The rest of the top 5 came through in the planned 5:00.</P>

<P>By mile 2, Dan had moved up to 12th and was looking strong. The
entire front group had slowed down considerably, letting most of the
pack back into the race. Dan, catching up with the leaders, did not
run as he planned, but slowed to their pace once catching them,
possibly hurting his overall place. Nolan continued to move up as he
ran his plan perfectly. Sean Montgomery, Albert Liu, Brian Anderson
and Ben Schmeckpeper slowed down too much in the 2nd mile, possibly
being lulled into thinking they were still running fast due to how
quickly everyone in front was slowing down. By mile two, there was
already a 40 second delta.</P>

<P>Mile three continued to be good ones for Feldman and Nolan and too
slow for the rest of MIT's runners. With the delta now up to one
minute it was obvious the team score would not be very good. </P>

<P>Feldman moved up to 7th by the four mile marker, but got outkicked
by two Harvard runners in the final 400 meters to finish a very
respectable 9th, the top Division III runner. Nolan continued to pass
people, finishing with a 4:52 final mile to move up to 32nd place.
Montgomery, who had not raced for a month due to a leg injury, had
lost focus during the 4th mile, but finished strong to finish 94th,
1:37 behind Feldman. Usually, Montgomery is within 40 seconds of Dan,
so there is hope he will get it together again by the end of the
season. Liu finished :01 behind Montgomery, but that was enough for
three opposing runners to squeeze in between them to put Liu back in
98th place. Anderson stepped up to replace a hurting Schmeckpeper,
but was nevertheless over 2:00 back of Feldman.</P>

<P>With all their woes, MIT was still able to finish ahead of Keene
State (14th) and Williams College (15th). Coach Halston Taylor
indicated his team had a lot of work to do to get to where they need
to be in four weeks. Their next meet is the NEWMAC conference
championship at Franklin Park on October 27th at 2:45. Both Coast
Guard Academy and WPI promise to give the Engineers some worries if
they cannot put a better team effort together.</P>
