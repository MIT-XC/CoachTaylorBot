NATIONALS</B></FONT>

Effort</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>November 17, 2001</P>

<P>Dan Feldman capped a great MIT cross country career with an
outstanding effort at the NCAA Division III National Cross Country
Championships held at Highland Springs Golf Course by host Augustana
College. Dan ran a near perfect race to finish 4th in a time of 24:23
on an unseasonably warm day that saw temperatures near 70 degrees.
Dan's time was the best of his career and earned him his first All
America award.</P>

<P>The remainder of the MIT team did not fair so well. Starting off
in reasonable position at the first mile, they never moved through
the crowd, which has been their trademark and served them so well
this season. While Dan came through the mile in 4:45 as he was just
off the lead pack, MIT 2 through 6 runners were all positioned
between 4:50 and 4:55, putting them between 60th and 120th--not
great, but certainly not too bad.</P>

<P>A little into the 3rd mile, Sean Nolan had moved into the top 30
the way he usually does, Albert Liu, Sean Montgomery, Ben
Schmeckpeper and Mark Strauss fell back to between 140th and 180th,
and the race to place among the top 10 teams was essentially over for
MIT. While Feldman forged ahead during the 4th mile, running a 5:01
mile, Nolan dropped :20 and faded over 20 places.</P>

<P>The last mile, which should be the fastest mile given that it
finished downhill and well below the elevation of the 4 mile mark,
was not the case for most of the engineers. Feldman ran a 4:39 final
mile but the best the other Engineers could muster was a 5:02 by All
America 800 runner, Sean Montgomery.</P>

<P>The normal delta for MIT's top 5 has consistently been within 1:15
at the end of this season. The normal deltas per man would have
placed the team 4th - 5th in the team competition. In part, this was
due to the extraordinary run by Feldman, but nevertheless, it did not
seem as though the mental effort was there by the remainder of the
team.</P>

<P>Coach Halston Taylor expressed how proud he was of his team for a
very successful season. "We had a great year, winning the UMass
Dartmouth Invitational, the NEWMAC Championship and placing 3rd in
the New England Division III Championship were great displays of what
this team can do. Today is what can happen when runners think too
much during a race and doubts enter their mind--both are like viruses
to a runner and will overwhelm anyone."</P>

<P>New England will lose a formula team, dropping the region to 4, in
next year's qualifying race due to MIT and Tufts finishing out of the
top 16 teams. The reduction of one team combined with MIT losing 3 of
their top 7 runners will make it very difficult for the Engineers to
return to nationals next year. However, Tech lost 3 of their top 7
runners last year and no one thought they would make if as far as
they did this year. We'll see.</P>
