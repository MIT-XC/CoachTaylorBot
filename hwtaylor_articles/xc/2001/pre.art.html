PREVIEW</B></FONT>

Well</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>September 28, 2001</P>

<P>MIT's Men's Cross Country team placed 7th out of 32 teams at the
National Preview Invitational held at Augustana College's Highland
Springs Golf Course. Despite leaving a healing Sean Montgomery at
home, the Engineers, led by a near and deserving victory by Dan
Feldman, ran a strong race against 8 other nationally ranked
teams.</P>

<P>Under clear skies and 70 degree temperatures, the 436 man field
wasted little time getting out to a quick pace on the rolling hill
course. The first mile went out in 4:50 and Feldman was right in
front with a number of other runners. The large field probably caused
MIT runners to get out a little too quickly, which was evident by the
19 second delta at the first mile.</P>

<P>The second mile broke the lead group up considerably, as a lead
group of three separated themselves from the rest of the pack.
Feldman was in this group and looked fresh as they came through the
hilly mile in 9:47. Sean Nolan fell 15 seconds back, Ben Schmeckpeper
could not hang with Nolan and Albert Liu showed running a
conservative first mile was a good idea as he negative split the
second mile, coming through in 10:18. Brian Anderson, trying to fill
Montgomery's shoes, was already paying for his 5:04 first mile as he
slowed to a 5:25 second mile.</P>

<P>The third mile was relatively flat, which allowed the runners to
recover before repeating the loop to encounter another hilly mile in
mile four. Feldman began to pull away at the start of the 5th mile
after coming through four in 19:52. Nolan had kept pace in 20:23, but
made up a lot of places as he moved into the top 20. Liu had passed
Schmeckpeper but they were close to each other at 21:00 and 21:04
respectively. Anderson had faded to fall behind Craig Wildman and
back to Carlos Renjifo.</P>

<P>The last mile is somewhat downhill, thus fairly quick if the
runners have anything left. Feldman had plenty  left, which he proved
by increasing his lead, until he took a wrong turn with a half mile
to go, on a very well marked turn he was not supposed to take. By the
time he turned around, he had lost about 25 seconds, and the race.
Dan defeated the only other runner who made the incorrect turn by 8
seconds and they had both pulled away from the eventual winner from
North Central College. Nolan finished with a 4:55 to move up to 14th
place. Liu ran a very consistent pace all through the course and
finished 52nd overall. Schmeckpeper finished in 63rd, and Anderson
followed in 100th after a strong 5th mile.</P>

<P>North Central won with 87 points, followed by 90 for Calvin
College. After that there were 8 teams within 47 points. MIT finished
in 7th with 235 points, 34 out of 3rd place. Montgomery's presence
would have probably knocked 60-70 points off of Tech's score, which
would have placed them a solid 3rd.</P>

<P>MIT has a lot of work to do if they wish to return to Augustana in
November for the National Championship. They show the 1-2 punch with
Feldman and Nolan and have the consistency of Liu about 1:00 back. If
Montgomery can get, and stay healthy, and Schmeckpeper can run with
or ahead of Liu, the Engineers should be back to represent New
England.</P>

<P>After taking next weekend off, MIT will race in the All Division
New England Championship at Franklin Park on 10/12.</P>
