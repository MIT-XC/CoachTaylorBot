Meet</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>September 1, 2001</P>

<P>75 degrees, windy</P>

<P>Franklin Park</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The MIT Men's Cross Country team showed they did their summer
training and intend on producing another successful season Saturday
when they ran away from an underrepresented Alumni team,
affectionately known as the Has-Beens, 19-42.</P>

<P>The grass was high and new ground had been installed on Bear Cage
Hill, both of which slowed things down considerably. However, don't
tell Dan Feldman that. After a first mile in 4:50, Dan pressed on,
winning by 1:00 over former All-America runner, Ethan Crain in 25:19.
This was Ethan's first race in over a year after a long recovery from
Achilles Tendinitis.</P>

<P>After Dan, the second group of Tech runners went out
conservatively, slowly trying to catch up to Crain. By the end, Sean
Montgomery had done just that, only to fall prey to Crain's deadly
kick. Sean Nolan, Ben Schmeckpeper and Albert Liu were within :35 of
Montgomery and showed a good front effort for the Engineers.</P>

<P>Has-Been, Josh Feldman followed MIT's top 5 with a fine effort.
The next six runners were representing the Varsity and were within
:39 of each other. George Hanson was the leader in this group,
followed by Craig Wildman, Carlos Renjifo, Brian Anderson, Greg
Fonder and Jeff Billing.</P>

<P>The Alumni were also represented well by Bob Collins, who was
right behind Billing, Rod Hinman and Dev Sinha.</P>

<P>The Engineers showed the ability to stick to their plan, exercise
patience and stay in their groups. </P>

<P>Next week, MIT travels to Troy, NY to compete against RPI and WPI
for the Engineer's Cup at 1:45 at Saratoga Springs Park.</P>
