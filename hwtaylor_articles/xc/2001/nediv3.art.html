Championship Advances Team</B></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>November 17, 2001</P>

<P>MIT's Men's Cross Country team placed 3rd among a 32 team field in
the New England Division III Championship/NCAA Region I Qualifier to
advance to next week's NCAA Division III National Championship being
hosted by Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois. After last
year's debacle, where MIT was considered the best team in the country
not to go to nationals, the team felt they had something to prove all
season. Led by Sean Nolan, who placed fourth in 25:08, and Dan
Feldman, 6th in 25:12, the Engineers scored 106 points behind 54 for
the victorious Keene State team and 83 for Bowdoin College. </P>

<P>The national formula for determining how many teams qualify out of
each of the eight regions, has New England sending five teams, the
maximum for any region. Last year, New England was also permitted
five teams, and MIT, thought to have a spot clinched, had to run
without one of its top runners and had poor races from the more
senior runners on the team. This ultimately caused them to miss the
trip to nationals by seven points as they finished sixth. </P>

<P>This year, there were six good teams who had a strong chance of
being among the five to advance. MIT did not concern themselves with
this proposition, but instead concentrated on trying to win the race.
Ranked 4th in the region, the Engineers nevertheless thought if they
could continue to improve as they had been doing all season, they
would have a chance.</P>

<P>The goal was to go out a bit slow at the start, but to be in good
position at the mile mark. The team definitely erred on the side of
caution as they left the line with an extremely slow start for all
but Feldman. By the mile mark, Dan was with the leaders in a fast
4:40 for the flat first loop. Sean Nolan was :08 back in 30th or so
and Sean Montgomery, Albert Liu, Ben Schmeckpeper and Brian Anderson
were another :06 behind in about 60th place. Mark Strauss, bothered
by a cold, was even more cautious in 5:04, putting him behind over
100 runners.</P>

<P>By mile 2, Feldman was in 2nd place, behind eventual winner, Mark
Miller of Keene State, who was beginning to pull away. Nolan had
closed the gap by :01, which moved him up about 10 places as some
began to fade. Montgomery, Liu, Schmeckpeper and Anderson lost
another :08-:10 but also moved up a few spots. Strauss was now
running the same place as Montgomery et al.</P>

<P>Miles 3 and 4 were back along a winding, narrow dirt road that
took the runners on an out and back loop. Feldman began to fatigue,
and Nolan moved up to 2nd place. Montgomery was beginning to separate
from Liu, but both were moving up through the field. Schmeckpeper had
a lapse during the 4th mile, which caused him to lose ground to his
teammates but held him steady in the race. Strauss was gaining on
Schmeckpeper to look to add some help, but Anderson was falling back
a bit.</P>

<P>In the final mile, three runners surprised Nolan and passed him
with over a half mile to go. However, Sean did not give up as he
passed one of them back to finish 4th. Dan held onto 6th, finishing
strong, despite going out so quickly. Montgomery had the best finish
with a 4:40 final mile to move up to 19th. Albert ran a great race,
finishing 33rd overall and only :57 behind Nolan. Ben regained focus
and finished strong to place 44th, only 1:11 behind Nolan. Mark
closed to with 3 places of Ben to provide the support the team
needed. Brian finished in 79th close out the team's scoring.</P>

<P>Coach Halston Taylor felt his team was a little too cautious at
the start, which cost them some places in the end. Nevertheless, he
feels the team ran their best race of the year thus far, particularly
Sean Nolan and Albert Liu.</P>

<P>While the team did not reach their lofty goal, they did reach
their beginning of the season goal, which was to advance to
nationals. However, the year is not over, as the Tech harriers have
yet to run their best race, which they hope will put them among the
top 10 teams at next weekends championship.</P>
