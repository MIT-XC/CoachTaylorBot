    VARSITY MANAGE PERFECT SCORES AGAINST ALUMS
    
    
                  
    
    August 31, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    Back on their home course at Franklin Park after a year of renovations and repairs to the fabled cross country course, the annual MIT Alumni Meet brought the current varsity teams against the "old timers" under very humid conditions, but overcast conditions.
    
    
                  
    
    Both the men's and women's varsity teams had perfect scores of 15 points, but in the women's race, it was only because the alumnae did not have five runners to score. Jacqui Wentz '10 schooled the youngsters as she put in a surge in the middle of the first mile to come through the mile in 5:40, a seven second lead, and cruise to a first place finish on the 3K course in 11:20.
    
    
                  
    
    The women's varsity was led by Maryann Gong '17 who finished six seconds behind Wentz in 11:26. The women had a delta of 11 seconds through five runners, an outstanding spread under the conditions. The grass was very high, slowing the times significantly, and combined with the heat and humidity, took its toll on the runners. The varsity runners were instructed to push the early pace, so maintaining contact with each other and not falling off the pace very much was impressive. Second for MIT was Elaine McVay '15 in 11:30. Kali Benavides '15 put in a kick to finish with McVay, also in 11:30. Alexandra Taylor '14 finished fourth for Tech in 11:32 and Kaitlin Allen '14 closed out the scoring with a 11:37. Also running for the Alumnae was Maggie Lloyd '12, finishing in 13:08. Kirsten Aarsvold '11 was in attendance to cheer on her teammates.
    
    
                  
    
    The Alumni were well represented with 10 competitors, and they competed well, but were not quite ready to challenge the full varisty squad. Benji Xie '15, led an MIT sweep with a tough 16:00 on the 5K course. Close behind was Roy Wedge '14 in 16:05. Matt Jordan '15 was third in 16:09. Allen Leung '15 was fourth in 16:10 and Rory Beyer '17 was fifth in 16:13. The men pushed the pace early, which affected some of the perfomances, particularly the freshmen, who tend to not have as great an ability to maintain competitiveness when they get fatigued. Nevertheless, the 13 second delta was pretty amazing.
    
    
                  
    
    Stephen Serene '12 was the top finisher for the "Has-Beens", finishing in ninth overall in 17:04. Chris Wong '08 was next in 11th place in 17:17. Logan Trimble '13 was third for the alums in 14th place with a time of 17:45. Richard Prevost '11 finished in 17th in 18:06 and finishing as the final scorer for the alums was Fivos Constantinou '06 in 18:19. Other finishers were Eric Khatchadourian '06, Josh Feldman '97, Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, Bill Phipps '10 and Joe Roy-Mayhew '08.
    
    
                  
    
    The Engineers will not compete again until 9/21 at the Pre-Regional race in Maine. There is a lot of work to do if the MIT squads hope to contend for regional honors, but the talent is certainly there.

    Men and Women Both Finish Third at NCAA New England Regional - Move on to Nationals
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's men's and women's cross country teams rode amazing individual performances to third place team finishes in the NCAA Division III New England Region Cross Country Championship today. The women finished with 127 points, claiming third out of 53 full teams, while the men totaled 113 points to take third place honors out of 50 complete teams. Both teams advance to Nationals next weekend at Hanover College in Hanover, Indiana.
    
    
                  
    
    The weather was near perfect for the women with 40-45 degree temperatures and overcast skies. The course was very flat with the exception of one hill, and only a bit muddy in the second and third miles. There were six nationally ranked teams vying for an opportunity to toe the line next weekend. Everyone expected a fast pace and Elaine McVay '15 did not disappoint, taking the opening mile out at 5:34. MIT's women were up towards the front where they were supposed to be with the exception of Tech's number seven runner, Louise van den Heuvel '14, who was up in third place at 5:35, which she has never come close to in a cross country race, particularly a 6K race. Kali Benavides '15, Kaitlin Allen '14, Brooke Johnson 'G, Alexandra Taylor '14 and Maryann Gong '17 were all between 5:41-5:43 in very good position.
    
    
                  
    
    As the team progressed through the second mile, everyone expected van den Heuvel to fall off, but she held her ground, finishing the two mile at 11:34. McVay was pulling ahead along with two other runners, clocking 11:21 at two miles. Benavides, who has been bothered by a upper leg injury, did not let it affect her as she stepped up beyond expectations. Also stepping up, Allen, who herself has been dealing with a hip injury, lost some ground in the second mile but was still only 23 seconds behind the streaking McVay. Taylor was competing great, running between Benavides and Allen. Johnson, experiencing very bad stomach pains, was doing her best to fight through it. Gong, still trying to get past her fears of dying in a 6K race was not being competitive.
    
    
                  
    
    McVay threw down another 5:47 mile in the third mile despite the hill and mud as she tried to break her opponents, but by the end of that mile both of them had pulled ahead of her. Benavides remained solid as did van den Heuvel and Allen. Taylor fell back a bit, now even with Allen. Both Williams and Middlebury were now dominating the race, but MIT was in a solid third. In the final .73, McVay really put on the speed, running 4:10, but still finishing third in 21:18, a 5:42 pace effort. Benavides finished in 21st with a 21:55. van den Heuvel stayed the course, finishing in 26th place with a time of 22:04. Allen ran the third fastest last .73 to finish 34th in 22:15, earning All Region honors. Johnson managed to speed up in the final minutes of the race to move past Taylor, placing 43rd in 22:24. Her surge in the final mile allowed MIT to stay ahead of Tufts University in the standings.
    
    
                  
    
    By the time the men started their race at 12:30, the sun was out and the temperatures had moved into the mid-50's. The men's side of the competition had seven nationally ranked teams fighting it out for a spot at the big show and the top five teams were very evenly matched depending on the day. 
    
    
                  
    
    While the women's step up moment belonged to Louise van den Heuvel, Matt Deyo '16 took notice and figured he could go one better. Deyo sprinted across the field as if it were an 800 meter race instead of the 8,000 meter race he actually had to complete. Fortunately, once across the field, Deyo slowed to a normal pace, but no one was going to pass someone so willing to do the work. Deyo hit the mile mark in front at 4:47 with Roy Wedge '14 a few places behind. The rest of the team was there as well with Allen Leung '15, Rory Beyer '17 and Benji Xie '15 at 4:50 and Ian Tolan '16 and Matt Jordan '15 playing it safe at 4:53.
    
    
                  
    
    Over the next two miles very little changed. At the front, Wedge was where he expected to be in fifth place, hitting the three mile mark in 14:55. Deyo fell back a few places, but was solid at 14:58. Leung and Beyer were together in great position at 15:08. Xie was with them at two miles, but fell in the third mile, getting injured and laboring 12 seconds behind by the three mile mark. This meant someone else had to step up. The conservative Tolan was only three seconds behind Xie, but needed to move if the Engineers were going to be competitive. Jordan, who had been on antibiotics due to an infection from a cold and sinus illness was still too weak to contribute significantly. However, he was doing his best, splitting 15:33 for three miles.
    
    
                  
    
    In mile four, Deyo actually closed the gap a bit, moving right up to Wedge. Leung and Beyer fell back some more, but stayed tough. It became clear Tolan was going to have to step up as Xie had given up and Jordan was just not up to it.
    
    
                  
    
    In the end, Wedge hammered a 4:45 final mile to stay in fifth place. Deyo ran 4:50 to place 7th. With Xie running what he was capable of, MIT would have been in it for the team title, but as it was Williams and Middlebury finished 1-2. Leung pulled away from Beyer in the final half mile to claim 25th and 29th places respectively in 25:18 and 25:21. Tolan closed well in 5:10 to finish in 47th place with a 25:52. MIT finished 36 points out of first, which was a total that could have been achieved with a perfect race. They will get another opportunity to show what they are capable of next week in Indiana.

    Men and Women Both Start Poorly - With Very Different Results at NEICAAA Championship
    
    
                  
    
    October 12, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    The first championship of the season, albeit one that meant nothing with regard to advancement or the end of the season results, was the NEICAAA Championship held at historic Franklin Park in Boston. The championship, one of the oldest in the country, dating back to 1912, matches Division I, II and III teams throughout New England. The weather was near perfect for cross country with temperatures in the low 60's with an overcast sky throughout the meet.
    
    
                  
    
    Both the men's and women's teams were ranked fourth in the country for Division III going into the meet. The women raced first. Unfortunately they were in box 39 of 43, nearly as far to the right of the course as possible with a right hand turn slightly to their left only 300 meters into the race. Not only would they have to get out well, they would have to move to the left significantly to avoid getting shut down at the turn. They moved to their left successfully but got caught too far back with at least 150 runners ahead of them as they hit the turn.
    
    
                  
    
    The women from MIT must have moved pretty hard because when they hit the mile mark they had moved up at least 50 individuals as Elaine McVay '15 was up to 32nd place and a pack of Tech runners, including Kaitlin Allen '14, Alexandra Taylor '14, Maryann Gong '17, Kali Benavides '15 and Stephanie Marzen '15 were in the top 100, but barely so. The Engineers continued to work throughout the second mile as McVay moved up to 28th while Allen and Gong moved into the top 50 with Taylor close behind. Unfortunately, while Benavides and Marzen continued to move up they were now 26 and 30 seconds behind McVay respectively. Louise van den Heuvel '14 had an excellent second mile, moving up to 125th place, impressive after being near last at the first turn of the course.
    
    
                  
    
    The third mile of the 5K course continued in the same fashion. McVay, who undoubtedly paid for her 2:43 first 800 and 5:34 first mile, was continuing to pass people as she finished in 23rd place in 18:14, the first Division III runner. Allen, running perhaps the smartest race of all MIT runners, moved all the way up to 33rd place in 18:25. Taylor also had an outstanding race, moving past Gong in the final 150 meters, finishing in 45th place in 18:37 to Gong's 18:39 in 50th place. The normally dependable Benavides and Marzen let various thoughts get to them, taking them out of the race mentally. Benavides ran 18:52 for 72nd place to give MIT a :38 second delta. Marzen slipped to 113th in 19:13. van den Heuvel fell back to 140th, running 19:29. The Engineers finished in seventh place, the second Division III team behind Middlebury College by 31 points.
    
    
                  
    
    In the women's sub-varsity race, Cindy Huang '15 led MIT to a 5th place finish, running a PR 19:19 in 18th place. Brooke Johnson 'G in her first race of the season after being out since last May, showed she should be back to top form in a few more weeks as she finished in 21st in 19:26. Also scoring for MIT were Christina Wicker '17 in 34th in 19:41, Heather Sweeney '16 in 52nd in 19:53 and Shivani Kaushal '15 in 69th place in 20:05.
    
    
                  
    
    The men were hoping to test their skills against the best in New England after already having defeated all the Division III teams in the past two meets. Similar to the women, the men were far to the right in box 28 of 41 boxes. While they did not get out really well, they were in pretty good position in the middle of the pack as they hit the first turn. However, between that point and the mile mark, the team ran more for position than for feel of pace. Unfortunately, for the first time in recent memory the leaders ran a conservative pace, hitting 4:44 at the mile mark, the exact pace Benji Xie '15 and Roy Wedge '14 were hoping for. Coach Halston Taylor had instructed them that a 4:45 first mile would usually have them around 50th or so at the mile mark. They must have been confused about their position and pace because they hit the mile between 4:57 and 4:59 between 90-100th position in the field.
    
    
                  
    
    At the two mile mark, Rory Beyer '17, Wedge and Xie were in 52nd-54th places in 10:07. Matt Deyo '16 was back at 10:14 around 85th place with Allen Leung at 10:17 in about 100th place. The third mile saw Beyer start to lose places, while Wedge and Xie moved all the way to 32nd place. Leung caught up to Beyer while Deyo stayed in 74th place. Justin Bullock '14 and Ken Leidal '17 were moving up, but had started to so far back that they were still in the 130's at 15:52 and 15:56 respectively. Wedge dropped Xie in the fourth mile, pouring on a 5:04 effort to move up to 26th place while Xie fell back to 36th. Leung moved to 49th but Deyo fell back to 89th and Beyer was back in the 90's. In the final, but somewhat short mile, Wedge dropped a 4:36 to move up to 15th place in 24:54. Leung finished second for the Engineers, placing 43rd in 25:27. Xie held on for 45th in 25:28. Deyo came back a bit, indicating a mental lapse in the middle of the race, finishing 74th in 25:48. Bullock ran a 4:48 to move up to 96th, finishing as MIT's fifth man in 25:59. Tech finished in ninth place, the fourth Division III team, 59 points out of fifth place and the first Division III team. A normal race by Beyer and Xie would have been a delta of 12 and four seconds from Wedge respectively, which would have been a 94 point reduction in score, which would have actually placed them fourth overall.
    
    
                  
    
    In the men's sub-varsity race, Matt Jordan '15 made his debut as he comes back from a patella tendon injury suffered when he jumped off a box at the beginning of the season. Jordan showed remarkable focus as he has only been running on solid ground for one week. His 26:03 time placed him seventh in his race and was sixth overall for MIT. Tech placed sixth out of 20 teams with 172 points. Eric Safai '14 placed 36th in 26:36, Matt McEachern '17 placed 48th in 26:46, Brian Gilligan '17 placed 50th in 26:50 and Jay McKenna '14 placed 64th in 27:03.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT does not race again until the NEWMAC Conference Championship, also at Franklin Park, in three weeks (November 3). The women need to work at having five runners having a good day on the same day as it seems they can only put four runners together on a given race day. The men need to be able to adjust to different circumstances and stay focused on the job at hand. Both are favored to win their conference championship and will undoubtedly be thinking ahead to the NCAA Division III Regional Championship two weeks later, but will be best served working out the kinks in their armor before Regionals.

    MIT Men and Women Cross Country Dominate NEWMAC Competition
    
    
                  
    
    November 3, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    Going into this weekend, it was assumed the MIT Cross Country teams would continue to dominate the NEWMAC Championship, hosted by Babson College at Franklin Park. After all, the men had never lost the championship, winning 15 in succession since the start of the conference in 1998. The women, late arrivals to that level of success, were going for their seventh in a row, having not lost since 2007. The NEWMAC Conference has some very good runners and at least a couple of teams that should be nationally ranked. Therefore, the Engineers were not taking anything for granted.
    
    
                  
    
    The harriers from MIT were determined to run aggressively on the damp course in order to test their ability to have a tight delta while pushing the limits. Of course, this strategy also makes it easy for opposing teams to follow along letting the leaders do the work, basically becoming targets. Both the men and women pulled the strategy off without error. The women won with a low score of 23 points, led by Elaine McVay's 18:17 wire to wire victory and a delta one through five of :33. Second place went to Wellesley College with 70 points. The men followed suit with an even better score of 18 points, led by Roy Wedge's 25:08 first place finish and a one through five delta of 44 seconds. Second place went to a very competitive Coast Guard team, scoring 44 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The conditions were wet from the drizzle that had fallen over the past 12 hours, but the temperature ideal at 45 degrees. At the gun Elaine McVay '15 went to the lead, hitting the mile mark is a cautious but steady 5:41. Her teammates (Maryann Gong '17, Brooke Johnson 'G and Alexandra Taylor '14) were right at the front of the chase group at 5:45. Christina Wicker '17, Louise van den Heuvel '14, Nicole Zeinstra '16 and Cindy Huang '14 were right behind at 5:47. There were one or two from a few of the teams up at the front, but for the most part it was all MIT. By mile two, McVay (11:37) had opened up a seven second lead on Wicker, who was having the race of her life. The rest of the MIT harriers were quite a bit back between 11:50-12:09. In the final full mile, McVay was relentless, putting down another 5:56 to stretch the lead to 19 seconds and no one closed that gap by the 5K+ (a little longer than 5K) finish in 18:17. Gong earned Rookie of the Year conference honors with her second place 18:37. Wicker held onto fifth place in 18:44. Johnson closed well for a sixth place 18:45. Taylor ran 18:50 for ninth and van den Heuvel ran her best race to date, finishing 10th in 18:59. Top 14 finishers earn All Conference honors.
    
    
                  
    
    The men also took an aggressive approach and it was a good thing, because Coast Guard was not going to give this away. Roy Wedge '14 and Benji Xie '15 took the pace out, but not as fast as was planned. The field seemed content with letting them lead so they were perhaps a little too cautious in the first mile, splitting 4:59 on the flat first mile. Matt Deyo '16, Rory Beyer '17, Allen Leung '15, Matt Jordan '15, Ken Leidal '17 and Justin Bullock '14 were close at 5:03 and another bunch (Ian Tolan '16, Matt McEachern '17, Rick Paez '15, Brian Gilligan '17, Eric Safai '14, Nick Matthews and Jay McKenna '14) were just behind them at 5:07. At the two mile mark Wedge and Xie held an eight second lead on  Beyer, Deyo and Leung. Two Coast Guard runners were trailing and then McEachern, Bullock and Jordan followed. As well as Tech raced, they took the foot off the gas in the third mile, which let Coast Guard back in the race. Wedge had begun to pull away from Xie. Deyo, Beyer and Leung were now 11 seconds behind, but Gary Ezzo of Coast Guard and Rob Ellinger of WPI  had joined them. By the four mile mark, Wedge put another eight seconds on the field. Xie faded back 20 seconds as his teammates caught him. Ezzo was now some 30 meters back and seemingly had given up. Hollinger was way back. Wedge added another four seconds to his lead as he won in 25:08. Deyo took second in 25:31. Ezzo must have taken advantage of Xie falling off the back of the group and found the energy to reengage in the race, preventing the sweep by MIT. Beyer took fourth in 25:39 to earn Rookie of the Year honors. Leung claimed fifth place and Xie sixth to close out MIT's scoring. Ian Tolan, in his first race of the year showed his competitiveness as he took 10th place, finishing sixth for the Engineers in 26:08. McEachern and Jordan, finishing 11th and 12th respectively, also earned All Conference honors.
    
    
                  
    
    MIT's next competition is in two weeks at the NCAA Division III New England Region Championship. The top two teams receive automatic bids to the NCAA Division III Championship while other teams may be selected as at-large selections.

    MIT Wins Men's and Women's Pre-Regional Race
    
    
                  
    
    September 21, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    The first intercollegiate race of the year for the 2013 MIT Cross Country teams was as good a start as could be expected. Under 65 degree temperatures and overcast skies, the University of Southern Maine hosted the pre-regional meet so New England teams could have the opportunity to see the course prior to the all important NCAA Division III Regional meet on November 16. Entering the meet, the men's field of 19 teams included nationally ranked number five Bowdoin College, number seven Bates College and number 11 Tufts University. MIT was back a bit at number 26. In the women's 5K field, also containing 19 teams, MIT was entering ranked number three in the country for Division III while number 19 Bates and number 29 Tufts were also in the meet along with a talented Colby College squad.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were up first. The Engineers were missing Sarah Quinn '16, who has compartment syndrome in her calves and will have to have surgery; Brooke Johnson 'G who is out with plantar fasciitis; Nicole Zeinstra '16, who is almost back and Martina de Geus '14 coming back from ACL surgery due to a landing coming off the waterjump in the 3000 Steeplechase at the NCAA Championship last May. Entering the meet a little under the weather, Elaine McVay '16 was recovering from a severe cold and freshman star, Maryann Gong was also coming back from a cold. Despite these losses, Tech would be pretty strong though not as deep as in previous years. 
    
    
                  
    
    The race went out at a solid pace on the relatively flat course as the lead runners hit the mile mark in 5:50. MIT runners led by Kaitlin Allen '14, Kali Benavides '15, McVay, Stephanie Marzen '15, Alexandra Taylor '14 and Gong came through just off the leader at 5:52. During the second mile, Allen took the lead and pulled away with a 5:53 mile as the field entered the hilly portion of the course. The rest of the MIT squad looked flat, but competitive. In the third mile, Allen continued to race well, putting down another 5:52 mile, but she failed to put the field away as she was capable of doing. As a result, she was caught in the final 100 meters by Hannah Zydanowicz from Roger Williams College. Allen finished first for MIT, second in the race overall in 18:11. Coming through to help MIT was Benavides in sixth, McVay in 12th, Marzen in 15th, and Taylor in 17th. The team delta was a respectable 30 seconds even though the times were a bit slow.
    
    
                  
    
    The end result had MIT's women taking first place with 52 points, just edging out a strong Tufts squad with 54 points and Bates College with 86 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The MIT men's harriers have plenty of talent, but still needed to prove it to themselves, and based on their ranking, the rest of the country. MIT was pretty healthy, only missing Matt Jordon '15 out of their top five as he recovers from a patella tendon injury suffered from something totally unrelated to running.
    
    
                  
    
    At the start, MIT's B group, led by Matt Deyo '16 and Ken Leidal '17 (still learning the concept of group running) abandoned all plans and decided to get out in front of the All America level lead group. MIT's A group, comprised of Roy Wedge '14, Benji Xie '15, Rory Beyer '17 and Allen Leung '15 were back a couple of seconds in 5:03. The lead group for MIT maintained consistency and integrity as they worked together, coming through in 10:15 through the hilly part of the course. Mile three was pretty fast at 5:08 and Tech was still with the leaders, and Deyo was only one second behind despite his foolhardy early pace. The fourth mile hit Deyo pretty hard, but he showed his toughness as he only dropped 20 seconds to the A group, who hit 5:00 as the race accelerated. Leung lost focus for a bit and slipped back with a 5:08 fourth mile. In the final mile, Wedge realized he had a lot more left than he thought. Wedge finished in third place in 25:20, nine seconds out of first place. Xie was fifth in 25:23, while Beyer, the top freshman in 25:37 was sixth. Leung hung tough to finish 10th in 25:47 and Deyo closed out the scoring in 13th in 25:58. The 38 second delta was quite impressive for the early season in such a competitive race.
    
    
                  
    
    When all was said and done MIT had come away with a tremendous upset victory with 37 points to 85 for Bates, 86 for Bowdoin and 95 for Tufts. This meet is extremely early in the season and does not mean anything other than identifying the teams to watch for two months from now in the championships.
    
    
                  
    
    Next week, MIT will travel to Williams College to test their abilities against the Ephs and many other teams entering the invitational. Williams is ranked number four on the women's side and eighth on the men's side.

    Men's Cross Country - Remains Undefeated, Women Place Second
    
    
                  
    
    September 28, 2013
    
    
                  
    
    Competing for the second week in a row, MIT's nationally ranked Cross Country teams traveled to Williams College to compete in the Purple Valley Classic. The men, having moved up from 28th to 5th in the country for Division III after last week's impressive showing at the New England Pre-Regional meet, were facing 9th ranked Williams and 23rd ranked Middlebury College among the 13 team field. The women, ranked 3rd in the country despite missing many of their top runners at least for the next three weeks, were going up against 4th ranked Williams, 8th ranked Middlebury and 28th ranked Amherst College among their field of 13 teams.
    
    
                  
    
    The very hilly and soft course, combined with 75 degree temperatures under a bright sun did nothing to help with a fast pace. MIT, typically comfortable with running their own race, stayed back and allowed other teams to set the pace. This resulted in a pedestrian 5:20 first mile despite the flat part of the course. The hilly second mile netted a 5:31 for the leaders. Up to this point the pace was so slow that there was a glut of runners in the front. In the third mile the leaders picked up the pace to 5:11, which spread the field significantly. Two Williams runners, three MIT runners (Roy Wedge '14, Benji Xie '15, Rory Beyer '17) and a smattering of runners from other teams. Matt Deyo '16 and Allen Leung '15, who both had to stop and put a shoe back on early in the race were 14 and 22 seconds back respectively, far ahead of their competitors fourth and fifth men. The hilly fourth mile destroyed most of the field, but Wedge ran 5:08, Xie 5:11 and Beyer 5:14. Howeve, they were still behind the two Williams runners and Xie and Beyer were behind two Middlebury runners as well. The final mile still has part of the final uphill and a very steep downhill that usually finishes off any quadricep strength the runners may have still had. The Tech runners showed their strength, finishing well with Wedge running 5:04 in the final mile to claim third in 26:14, Xie fourth in 26:18 and Beyer, the top freshman in the field, fifth in 26:20. Deyo and Leung hung tough to finish 13th and 16th respectively, finishing ahead of Williams' and Middlebury's fourth runners. The end result left MIT with 41 points. Williams was second with 59 points and Middlebury third with 60 points.
    
    
                  
    
    The women were running 6K for the first time and the heat made this a concern. Similar to the men, the MIT women had no intention of leading. Middlebury did not mind taking the lead and pulled the group through a 6:00 lead mile. The second mile was a bit slower as they had to deal with the smaller hills on the course. Elaine McVay '15 led her MIT teammates at two miles in 12:10. Right with her were Maryann Gong '17, Kali Benavides '15 and Stephanie Marzen '15. Alexandra Taylor '14 and Kaitlin Allen '14 were two seconds back. Christina Wicker '17 was three more seconds back but then there was another 15 seconds before the next Tech runner. The third mile included the big hill the men had to do twice. McVay smoked the hill to take the lead but was caught on the downhill portion and then passed going to the finish, ending up in second with a fast 22:29. Benavides ran a superb race, finishing fourth in 22:43. Williams had finished 1-3 and MIT 2-4 and now came Middlebury with the next four places. Gong dropped out of the race from heat exhaustion, but Marzen and Taylor took up the slack, running their best 6K's ever to finish 9-10 in 22:58 and 22:59 respectively. Through four runners MIT had 25 points and Middlebury 26 and Williams only had two runners across the line. Middlebury's fifth runner was 12th and then Williams packed in four runners and there was another from Middlebury before Allen finished for MIT in 18th place. The final score was Middlebury 38, MIT 43 and Williams 46.
