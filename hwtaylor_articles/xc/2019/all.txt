    ### Varsity Teams Prevail Over Alumni in Annual Meet
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    August 31, 2019
    
    
                
    
    Racing in 75 degree, sunny weather, with low humidity, it was about as comfortable as one can expect on the last day of August.  Both the Alumni/ae and current MIT runners got caught up in the moment and ran a little too aggressively on the extremely hilly Larz Anderson Park course in Brookline, Massachusetts, leading to some pretty serious decay by some over the final half of the 2.76 mile course.  Both Varsity teams prevailed in the annual Alumni/ae competition.  The men won with a perfect score of 15 to 50, while the women won 7-16 in an adapted scoring of only three per team due to a shortage of alumnae present to race.
    
    
                
    
    The men raced first, with the varsity wasting no time in taking control of the pace.  At the mile mark, Sanjay Raman '23 was leading Steven Goldy '20 and fellow freshmen Cameron Kleiman '23 and Lowell Hensgen '23 in a crisp 5:04 split.  The alumni, represented by Jared Forman '13, Brian Gilligan '17, Harrison Hunter '15, Alex Knapp '19, Aidan Gilson '19, Nicholas Waltman '18, Josh Feldman '97, Terry McNatt '87, Kevin DiGenova '07, David Westenberg '79 and Bob Collins '82, were not too close to the leaders, but were more than challenging themselves on the difficult course.  Forman, Gilligan and Hunter were the closest to the varsity runners.
    
    
                
    
    At the two mile mark, Kleiman and Hensgen were in the lead with Raman at 10:32, but Matthew Kearney '22 had moved slightly ahead of Goldy with Sam Acquaviva '23 close behind.  Going into the finish, Kearney had pulled up to Kleiman, but then Kleiman opened up a pretty vicious kick to win despite having difficulty recognizing the finish line chute.  Both were timed in 14:33.  The next three were freshmen Hensgen 14:36, Raman 14:40 and Acquaviva 14:44 to close out the perfect score for the varsity.  A 12 second delta with four of the first five being freshmen is pretty impressive, even on a short course.
    
    
                
    
    Forman finished in 16th in 15:46, out-kicking Gilligan, who finished 17th in 15:50.  Hunter was 18th in 16:42, Knapp 20th in 17:06, Gilson 21st in 17:34, Waltman 22nd in 18:10, Feldman 23rd in 18:26, McNatt 24th in 18:50, DiGenova 25th in 18:50, Westenberg 26th in 19:03 and Collins 27th in 20:25.
    
    
                
    
    The women went out even more aggressively than the men.  Katie Collins '21 led the way from start to finish, although she was pushed along the way.  At the mile mark, Collins led the way at 6:01.  Kirsi Rajagopal '23 and Anna Haddad '23 were extremely aggressive for a pair of freshmen, coming through at 6:03 and 6:04 respectively.  Megan McCandless '20 was close behind in 6:05.  Representing the alumnae were Mary Eccles '18, Maryann Gong '17 and Alexandra Taylor '14.  Gong was with Rajagopal at the mile mark and Eccles was just ahead of McCandless. Only scoring three runners, if the alums could go 1-2, they would win the meet.
    
    
                
    
    The hills took their toll on the women even more so than the men.  At the two mile mark Collins was still in the lead, but had slowed to 12:34 and was only one second ahead of McCandless.  Haddad had moved into third at 12:41, and Katie Williams '21 (12:56) and Einat Gavish '22 (12:58) had moved past Rajagopal (12:59).  Overall, Eccles was just ahead of Gong in fourth and fifth place at 12:42 and 12:43 respectively.  It was still a race.
    
    
                
    
    In the final .76, Collins put the race out of reach, winning by eight seconds in 17:17.  McCandless finished second and Eccles passed Haddad for third in 17:32.  Gong was just one second behind Haddad in 17:38.  Williams and Gavish finished fourth and fifth for the varsity in 17:48 and 17:56.  The spread was 39 seconds, which was a little much for a short course.
    
    
                
    
    In attendance, cheering on their alumni teammates were Eric Khatchadourian '06, Josh Rosenkranz '19, Don Shobrys '75 and Roy Wedge '14.
    
    
                
    
    The Engineers will now get down to some serious training in preparation for the season.  Pre-season rankings mean very little, but the women, who have finished among the top six in the country at the NCAA Division III Championship for the past 10 years, are ranked fifth, while the men are ranked eighth.  Their next meet will by September 28th at Williams College for the Purple Valley Invitational.

    ### Women Win Conn College Invite, Men Finish Second
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    October 19, 2019
    
    
              
    
    MIT's Women's Cross Country team felt they had something to prove after a poorly run race at the Purple Valley Classic, where they finished third behind Tufts and Williams, and a race cut short  by the lead vehicle taking a wrong turn at the Pre-National race--even though they won that race.  With a perfect 60 degree, sunny day they got their chance against a 29 team field at the Connecticut College Invitational, that included nationally ranked #4 Tufts, #5 Williams, #12 Carleton, #14 RPI, #18 Middlebury, #20 Rochester, #29 Wesleyan, #31 Coast Guard and #34 Vassar.
    
    
              
    
    MIT, ranked seventh, got out well, positioning themselves towards the front of the pack.   At the mile mark Tufts had runners at second and third place, Middlebury also had two among the top nine and Williams had three among the top 17.  Although only Katie Collins '21 represented MIT among the top 10, Tech had five among the top 20.
    
    
              
    
    At the two mile mark, Tufts was still in second and third, Williams, Middlebury and Carleton all had two in the top 12. Izzi Gengaro '22 joined up with teammate Collins in the top 10 and Katie Bacher '20 joined Megan McCandless '20 and Einat Gavish '22 among the top 17.  Freshman star, Kirsi Rajagopal was racing with a cold and her fast start was starting to bite her as she fell out of the top 20, but was racing tough.
    
    
              
    
    At mile three it was clear that Collins was getting in her own head and trying to hold on.  It was equally clear that Gengaro was on fire and hunting people down at a furious pace.  Tufts remained in second and third but were falling off a bit.  The two Williams runners had moved past Collins.  However, MIT's depth was rock solid and still among the top 20.
    
    
              
    
    At the finish, Gengaro had thrown down a 4:09 final .73 on top of her 5:36 third mile to move into second place in 21:07 for 6K.  With Collins falling off and Rajagopal not able to respond at her normal level due to her sickness, Bacher came through in 12th place in 21:49.  Collins held onto 15th in 21:58, McCandless was 18th in 22:04 and Gavish finished in 28th in 22:16 to seal the victory with 75 points. The Engineers had put five runners across the finish line before any other team's fourth runner.
    
    
              
    
    The men, seeded second in a 28 team field, were ranked 12th nationally going into the meet.  Among the 28 teams were nationally ranked Williams at #1, RPI at 14, Amherst at 18, Middlebury at 20, Ithaca at 27 and St. Lawrence at 35.  
    
    
              
    
    Unlike the women, MIT's men got out a little too fast, putting themselves  too far up in the pack early in the 8K race.  They were clearly dominating the race at the mile mark.  Andrew Mah '22 was in the top five.  Sanjay Raman '23 continued his outstanding racing as he was in 12th place.  Vedang Lad '23, Matthew Kearney '22 and Ryan Wilson '22 were together between 15th and 20th.
    
    
              
    
    At the two mile mark Mah was still there in sixth, Raman had moved up to 10th.  Kearney was still among the top 15, but Wilson and Lad had fallen back to 23rd and 27th respectively, while Williams' runners were starting to roll and move up to MIT.
    
    
              
    
    In the third and fourth mile it was clear that Williams had run a superior race, catching MIT and moving past with no challenge as the Engineers were tired and holding on.  At four miles Williams was in first, fifth, 15, 16 and 19 while MIT was in eighth, 10th, 16th, 24th and 26th.
    
    
              
    
    At the finish, the momentum continued in favor of Williams College as they finished with an impressive 47 points with first, fifth, 11th, 12th and 18th places.  MIT finished 10th (Mah), 15th (Raman), 21st (Kearney), 22nd (Lad) and 28th (Sam Acquaviva '23) for a convincing second place finish with 96 points, 53 points ahead of third place RPI.
    
    
              
    
    Both teams performed well for MIT, running hard and tough. There is work to be done, but the Engineers are headed in the right direction with five weeks to go before the NCAA Division III Championship in Louisville, KY.
    
    
              
    
    In two weeks MIT returns to competition to defend their NEWMAC Conference Championship.  The men will be going for their 22nd consecutive title.  The women have a nice streak of their own, having won the past 12 years.

    ### Women Seventh, Men Ninth at NCAA DIII Championship
    
    
                  
    
    ##### Gengaro, Collins and Raman Claim All American Honors
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    November 23, 2019
    
    
                
    
    MIT entered the NCAA Division III Championship seeded fifth in the women's rankings and 15th in the men's rankings.  Neither team believed they had run their best race and wanted to prove they could beat their seeds among the top 32 teams in the country.
    
    
                
    
    The weather in Louisville inspired true cross country.  Rain and 40 degree temperatures made for exciting race conditions if not necessarily the best spectator environment.  It had rained off an on much of the week, making the course at Tom Sawyer Park very muddy by the start of the men's race, and an absolute mud pit on parts of the course after the men's race--setting the women up for a memorable if not enjoyable experience.
    
    
                
    
    MIT changed their spikes to 1/2" length to aid in navigating the muddy terrain, which seemed to help considerably.  The men were lined up in box 43 of 46 boxes.  Experience on this particular course dictated that they needed to get out hard or they would be on the far outside of the first left sweeping turn, losign significant time.  They did this well, possibly too well.  However, they had demonstrated that their best races came when they went out fast but comfortable and raced where they felt they belonged.
    
    
                
    
    At the mile mark, Sanjay Raman '23 was in 15th position in 4:48, which was certainly not too fast on this flat course, despite the mud.  Andrew Mah '22 was close behind in 20th. Matthew Kearney '22 and Josh Derrick '20 were right there in the mid-20's.  Steven Goldy '20 was in solid position in 4:54 as MIT's fifth man.  At the 3K mark the chip reader mat had MIT in first, which they knew would not hold, but they were certainly going to fight to hold it.
    
    
                
    
    At two miles, Raman was still in 15th in 9:44, but Mah had faded back to 26th as he illogically thought he could settle-in and be okay, not realizing that disengagement was taking him out of the race.  Kearney and Derrick were in 38th and 39th in 9:50 and Goldy was in 90th in 9:54.
    
    
                
    
    The third mile had a slight uphill and a predominance of mud.  This temporarily slowed the field, but not significantly.  At the half-way point MIT was in third place and looking strong.  At the four mile mark, Raman was still in 17th.  Mah was in 44th, and with the top 40 earning All American, it was hoped he could make a charge to the finish.  Derrick was in 64th, Kearney in 73rd and Goldy in 110th.  The team was running an excellent race.
    
    
                
    
    In the final mile the Engineers lost a lot of places although they kept fighting.  Raman slipped to 30th in 24:52 to earn All-American as a freshman, the first male to ever do so at MIT in Cross Country.  Mah fell back to 60th in 25:11.  Kearney dropped to 83rd and Derrick to 87th.  Goldy was the only one to hold onto his position.  Even though the Engineers lost 62 points in the final mile, they finished ninth with 299 points, which deducts the individual places of those not on teams.  
    
    
                
    
    The women from MIT were in box 19, which was a much more favorable position than the men.  Still not wanting to be in the back of the pack on the first turn, the women went out hard to gain an advantageous position.
    
    
                
    
    Izzi Gengaro '22 was in fifth position at the mile mark, coming through in 5:28, well behind the leaders, who were out in 5:20.  Katie Collins '21 and Katie Bacher '20 were in 33rd and 36th places respectively, both running 5:36.  Einat Gavish '22 was in 53rd place in 5:40 and Megan McCandless '20 and Katie Williams were between 105th and 110th in 5:47.
    
    
                
    
    Gengaro and Collins moved up in the second mile, but the rest of the Engineers, while fighting hard were starting to lose ground.  Gengaro hit two miles in 11:12, still in a five person group between fourth and eighth.  Collins was now up to 16th in 11:17.  Bacher was hanging tough in 38th position in 11:32.  Gavish ran 11:41 in 66th place.  McCandless was in 118th in 11:53.  Williams lost her shoe during the second mile and was struggling to race with one shoe.  Already with a :41 delta, the challenging third mile could doom Tech from their goal of being among the top four teams.
    
    
                
    
    During the third mile the delta 1-5 expanded to 1:16, taking the women out of the top four teams.  In the final .73, Gengaro lost a few spots, finishing 10th in 21:30, earning All America honors, the highest individual finish ever for the MIT women's team.  Collins was only :12 seconds back in 15th place, also earning NCAA All America honors.  This was also the first time MIT had two women among the top 15 at the NCAA Championship.  Bacher finished in 70th in 22:36, Gavish was 111th in 22:57, and McCandless 159th in 23:15.  
    
    
                
    
    The women finished in seventh place with 252 points once the individuals not with teams were taken out of the scoring.  Losing 119 places over the last 1.73 miles was primarily a coaches error.  Coach Halston Taylor took the blame as he had encouraged the team to get out hard based on the teams inability to move up on this course in 2016 when the team was caught behind the majority of the field.  His strategy worked for Gengaro and Collins.  However, he admitted he should have instructed runners three through five to be slightly more conservative at the start and  move up through the field.
    
    
              
    
    The men have two seniors among their top 12 runners, Josh Derrick and Steven Goldy, both with eligibility remaining.  Goldy will return to MIT  for graduate school, while Derrick is still deciding on his best path academically.  Returning all members would be a big plus for the Engineers. The women will lose two among their top five, but otherwise have a relatively young team. MIT will look forward to the 2020 season.

    ### MIT Fails To Defend Regional Title
    
    
                  
    
    #### Gengaro Wins Women's Individual Championship
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    November 16, 2019
    
    
                
    
    In the first cold-weather meet of the season, the NCAA New England Region championship at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where the temperature during the men's warm-up was in the upper 20's, and warmed up to 30 at race time, MIT's men were seeded second among the 54 team field, ranked 12th in the country.  Williams was the favored team to win, ranked second in the NCAA Division III rankings.  Other nationally ranked teams in the field were Amherst (17th), Middlebury (21st), Colby (24th), and Bates (28th).
    
    
                
    
    In the previous two meetings Williams had run a conservative start relative to MIT's overly aggressive starts.  They worked together to run down MIT runners and win both outings.  Going into this race, MIT planned on running more intelligently and not putting themselves out there as a target.  MIT had won this meet two of the past three years and wanted to get back there.  Williams could not have cared less as they moved quickly to the front of the race, totally disregarding everyone else.  Even though the pace was not very fast (4:49 for the leader at the mile mark on the flattest course possible), MIT was thrown off by Williams moving to the front and settled in a bit too far back.  At the mile mark MIT had Sanjay Raman '23 and Andrew Mah '22 sandwiched between Williams fifth and sixth runners.  The next group of MIT runners, Vedang Lad '23, Josh Derrick '20, Matthew Kearney '22 and Ryan Wilson '22, were back between 50th and 60th place, three to four seconds back.
    
    
                
    
    In the woods it was difficult to move up and MIT had a major challenge on their hands.  Middlebury and Colby were also ahead of MIT and Amherst had four ahead of MIT's third runner.  Two miles later, with the exception of Raman and Mah, MIT fell further behind the surging Ephs, now 15 seconds back.  MIT had moved up significantly place wise to the other teams, passing Middlebury and Amherst, but still were three points behind Colby. At three miles.  
    
    
                
    
    In the fourth mile MIT had continued to move up.  Mah made a big move to slide into a solid third place and was closing in on second.  Raman was in 13th, Lad in 23rd, Kearney in 24th and Derrick in 27th.  Their total of 90 points was well behind Williams, but had passed Colby by nine points.  However, in the final mile, Mah lost motivation and gave up enough to fall to 15th place in 25:18.  Raman moved up to 10th in 25:07, but Colby runners moved up to third and fifth.  Lad gained one place, moving to 22nd in 25:31, but Derrick lost two places, finishing in 29th in 25:36 and Kearney hit the wall, dropping to 31st in 25:40.  Colby held on better, netting one place better among their three through five runners, compared to one mile earlier, to take second place by a score of 93 to 107.  Williams literally and figuratively ran away with the title, totaling 24 points.
    
    
                
    
    By the time the women took to the course, the ground was still frozen, but the ambient temperature was about 34 degrees and the sun was out.  The men were not able to chew up the course too badly due to it being frozen in most places, so overall the conditions were excellent.  The NCAA Division III #3 ranked team, MIT had lost to both Williams and Tufts back in September, but had beaten both teams three weeks ago. In addition, MIT had won this race the previous three years and the seniors were looking for the four year sweep.  Williams, apparently not concerned about MIT, uncharacteristically moved to the front and took the race to the rest of New England. 
    
    
                
    
    At the mile mark, MIT had covered the strategy up front, and looked to be doing the same on the back-end.  Williams occupied places 17, 18, 20, 22 and 23.  MIT was now in 4 (Izzi Gengaro '22), 7 (Katie Collins '21), 21 (Katie Bacher '20), 25 (Einat Gavish '22) and 37 (Megan McCandless '20), giving the Engineers a 94 to 100 advantage.  The pace was quick with Gengaro splitting 5:37 and McCandless 5:47.  From this point on Williams was the more aggressive of the two teams.  They had moved up and continued to pull ahead of Bacher, Gavish and McCandless.
    
    
                
    
    By the three mile mark, Gengaro had taken the lead, splitting 17:06.  Collins was up to fifth in 17:11, but Bacher was back in 18th at 17:30.  Williams had moved up to 7, 8, 16, 17 and 24.  MIT had improved to 81 points, but Williams was now ahead with 73.  In the final .73 the only change was Williams pulling further ahead.  Gengaro held on for the victory in 21:19 and Collins had the best cross country race of her career, finishing fifth in 21:28.  Williams then closed with eighth, ninth, tenth and 16th before Bacher finished in 20th at 22:05.  The fifth Williams runner was immediately behind her to close out the scoring with 64 points.  Closing out MIT's scoring was Gavish in 28th (22:20) and Katie Williams in 30th (22:23).  The final score was Williams 64 and MIT 84.  Third place went to Tufts with 156 points.
    
    
              
    
    As the teams prepare to travel to Louisville and Tom Sawyer Park, the Engineers have to do a "gut-check" to see if they want a shot at the podium badly enough to bring their A game and stay on focus the entire race.

    ### MIT Men and Women Defend NEWMAC Crowns
    
    
                  
    
    #### Gengaro and Mah Claim Individual Titles
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    November 3, 2019
    
    
                
    
    On a near perfect weather day at historic Franklin Park (site of the 1992 World Cross Country Championship and two USA Championships), MIT kept their NEWMAC Cross Country Championship streak alive, with the men winning their 22nd consecutive championship (the only team to have ever won the championship) and the women bringing home the trophy for the 13th time in succession.
    
    
                
    
    The men's race was delayed 20 minutes due to the Coast Guard Academy bus breaking down half-way to Boston.  However, everyone was made aware early enough that it did not affect the race in any manner.  Once the race was underway, MIT's Andrew Mah '22 and Sanjay Raman '23 led the way, although a bit slower than planned, coming through the flat first mile in a pedestrian 5:03.  With such a slow pace, the front was bunched up much more than usual, and MIT had 13 runners either at 5:03 or 5:04.
    
    
                
    
    Although they did not speed up, but rather maintained their effort through the hilly second mile, Mah and Raman pulled away from most of the pack, and those now remaining were Ryan Wilson '22, Matthew Kearney '22 and one opposing runner, David Reynolds '23 of WPI.  MIT's next pack, Finn Jacobson-Schulte '21, Josh Derrick '20 and Steven Goldy '20 were only six seconds back.  In-between was Vedang Lad '23 at 10:21.
    
    
                
    
    Throughout the third and fourth mile, Mah and Raman pulled away a little more, Jacobson-Schulte, Derrick and Goldy were closing the gap on all opposing runners, and Lad, Wilson and Kearney were falling back a little.
    
    
                
    
    In the final mile, Mah pulled away with a strong 4:44 final mile to gap Raman by eight seconds, 25:22 to 25:30. Reynolds took third place to break up the MIT sweep, but the next six runners wore MIT colors, led by Jacobson-Schulte's 25:48.  Close behind were Derrick (25:51), Lad (25:53), Wilson (25:58), Kearney (25:59) and Goldy (26:04). 
    
    
                
    
    MIT's 18 points easily won out over WPI's 45.  Third was Coast Guard with 99.  Springfield followed in fourth with 122, then Babson with 156, Wheaton at 158, Emerson with 212 and Clark with 228. 
    
    
                
    
    Mah earned NEWMAC Runner of the Year and Raman claimed Rookie of the Year honors.
    
    
                
    
    The women's start was changed at the last minute, going from 12:10 to 12:15, which caused some runners to panic a little.  When the race finally went off, there was not too much of a lead group as MIT's top group took it out in 5:43.  Izzi Gengaro '22, Katie Bacher '20 and Katie Collins '21 were running well together, and Einat Gavish '22 was close behind at 5:45.  Quite a few opposing runners were braving the early pace, but that disappeared in the second mile.
    
    
                
    
    Without her teammates; Megan McCandless '20 and Kirsi Rajagopal '23, both out with illnesses, Gavish was running alone, trying to stay close to her teammates, but she lost 14 seconds in the second mile.  Of course so did most everyone else as Gengaro, Bacher and Collins came through two miles in 11:47.  Staying between the group of Gengaro et al, and Gavish were the Rieders twins; Hannah and Madeline, from Mount Holyoke College.  Closing in on the other top opponents were Katie Williams '21, Marissa McPhillips '20 and Alana Chandler '22.  
    
    
                
    
    After three miles and entering the last .73 where they had to run Bear Cage Hill once more, Gengaro was pulling away and looking very comfortable. Bacher was running strong as was Collins.  Gavish was trying to close in on the twins, but could not narrow the gap.  Williams was working on passing two opposing runners remaining between her and Gavish, and McPhillips was trying to do the same.
    
    
                
    
    In the end, Gengaro pulled away to win in 21:58.  Bacher was second in 22:19 and Collins was third in 22:27.  After the twins, Gavish was sixth in 22:57 and Williams placed seventh in 23:01.  While 1:03 is not the best spread for 1-5, the addition of McCandless and Rajagopal should remedy that a bit.  McPhillips was in ninth in 23:12 for her best race of the season.
    
    
                
    
    MIT finished with 19 points to 80 for Mount Holyoke.  Wellesley was third with 92, followed by WPI with 116.  In fifth was Coast Guard with 141, Smith College was sixth with 142, Wheaton was seventh with 182, Springfield was eighth with 195, Babson was ninth with 217, Emerson was 10th at 328 and Clark was 11th with 333 points.
    
    
                
    
    Gengaro was honored as NEWMAC Runner of the Year.
    
    
                
    
    In two weeks, MIT heads to Bowdoin College for the NCAA Division III New England Region championship.  The top two teams earn an automatic birth to the NCAA Division III National championship, with other top finishing teams possibly earning at-large births to the 32 team championship in Louisville, KY.

    ### Women Win Pre-Nationals Behind Collins, Men Fourth
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    October 5, 2019
    
    
              
    
    MIT entered the Louisville Cross Country Classic / Pre-National championship as favorites to win on the women's side and seeded fourth on the men's side, at least according to the Nationals polls.  Despite a disaster in the women's championship 6K, where the lead vehicle took the runners on an incorrect path after the 3.9K mark, due to a lapped runner and the wrong gate on the course being open, the women won easily, although only calculated through the 3.9K mark.  The men indeed finished fourth, but not quite the way they planned for.
    
    
              
    
    MIT brought 10 runners per gender, so most anyone with a chance to be on the team that hopes to make Nationals in seven weeks, would have a chance to see the course.  Only seven were permitted in the Varsity race (Silver), so MIT had three runners in the Blue race, which was a 5K for women and the normal 8K for men.
    
    
              
    
    The men raced first and were represented by Ryan Wilson '22, Vedang Lad '23 and Zach Johnson '22.  All three got out really well, and at the mile mark, all three were in the front pack at 4:50.  As the race progressed, Wilson continued to race well, particularly in the final two miles where he ran 5:04 and 4:45 respectively to run 25:04 and place 15th.  Lad lost some focus in the middle of the race but finished with a 4:45 for a 25:20 and 31st overall.  Johnson also seemed to lose focus, but did not really get it back as he finished 53rd in 25:40.
    
    
              
    
    The women's Blue race was next.  Alana Chandler '22, Marissa McPhillips '20 and Anna Chau '23 represented MIT in the 5K race. Chandler ran her best cross country race yet, running 5:54 and 6:01 through two well paced miles.  She fell off a bit in the final 1.1 of the course, but led MIT with a 47th place finish in 19:09.  McPhillips, stayed close, finishing 64th in 19:19.  Chau did not race to her potential, finishing 190th in 20:17.
    
    
              
    
    The men, ranked 11th nationally in Division III, were seeded behind #1 North Central College, #5 UW LaCrosse, and #9 Johns Hopkins.  The goal was to get out and race with the top teams, knowing rankings do not always accurately portray a team's actual performance level.  At the mile mark, Andrew Mah '22, Sanjay Raman '23 and Cameron Kleiman '23 were out with the front pack in 4:46 and 4:47. Sam Acquaviva '23 and Lowell Hensgen '23 were right behind in 4:49.  Back a little were the old men on the team, Finn Jacobson-Schulte '21 and Steven Goldy '20.  Up to this point in the season MIT's top five has been dominated by freshmen and sophomores.
    
    
              
    
    Through the second and third miles, Mah, Raman and Kleiman stayed within two seconds of each other and continued to race among the top 10 individuals.  Acquaviva, suffering from tight calves, and Hensgen having a poor physical and mental day, fell back badly.  However, Jacobson-Schulte and Goldy were racing well, about 20 seconds back at three miles.  
    
    
              
    
    Mah pulled away from his teammates in the fourth mile and Jacobson-Schulte and Goldy lost a little more time.  However, all finished well in the somewhat downhill final mile.  Mah closed with a 4:47 to finish 10th in 24:44.  Raman threw down a 4:43 to move up to 17th in 24:51 and Kleiman ran 4:44 to move up to 20th in 24:53.  Jacobson-Schulte was :26 back in 47th place and Goldy three places further back in 25:21.  The total score of 144 put MIT fourth.  North Central won with 85 points and Johns Hopkins was second with 116 points.  The surprise team was Otterbein in third (nationally ranked 14th), just ahead of MIT with 127 points, while UW LaCrosse was seventh with 201 points, just behind 16th ranked RPI with 194, and John Carroll, also with 194 points.  Acquaviva finished 71st in 25:42, and Hensgen finished 115th in 26:15.
    
    
              
    
    The Women's Silver race was the final collegiate race of the day.  The temperature, which started out at 60 degrees for the Gold race, was now about 73. MIT was seeded first, ranked seventh nationally.  RPI was ranked 11th, UW LaCrosse 13th, Oberlin 14th, St. Thomas 15th, Hope 16th and a few other colleges ranked among the top 30 in the country.
    
    
              
    
    MIT got out well, but certainly not in front.  However, by the mile mark, MIT was front and center with Katie Collins '21 and Megan McCandless '20 leading the way in 5:45, along with Katie Bacher '20 right behind.  Kirsi Rajagopal '23, Einat Gavish '22 and Anna Haddad '23 came through in 5:47.  Katie Williams '21, not feeling her best was back at 5:50.  
    
    
              
    
    At the two mile mark, Collins had begun to pull away, but only by 10 meters or so as she ran a 5:37 to gap her opponents and teammates.  Rajagopal and McCandless were 10 seconds back at 11:32 and Bacher and Gavish were together at 11:35.  Haddad was falling back as her hip began to bother her. 
    
    
              
    
    At 3.9K of the 6K race, the Gator went the wrong way, taking the runners with it.  By the time the Gator stopped and the runners began to turn around to go back the right way, Collins had run over 200 meters in the wrong direction.  When she turned around she was now behind all the runners she was ahead of, in 125th place.  The race continued to the finish with some part of the course cut off.  Although they completed the race with Collins moving all the way back up to 25th and MIT still winning, the Games Committee and officials agreed the only fair way to call the race was to end it at 3.9K.  MIT finished with 43 points, while Oberlin was second with 115 points.  St. Thomas was third with 192 and Hope College was fourth with 202.
    
    
              
    
    Individually, Collins won in 13:50, five seconds over second place.  Seventh and eighth were Rajagopal and McCandless in 14:06 and 14:08 respectively.  Gavish was 11th in 14:13 and Bacher finished out the scoring in 16th in 14:15.  Williams was 50th in 14:34 and Haddad 92nd in 14:58.
    
    
              
    
    MIT's next race is on October 19th at the Conn. College Invitational.

    ### Mah and Rajagopal Lead MIT at Purple Valley Classic
    
    
              
    
    
                
    
    September 28, 2019
    
    
                
    
    Entering their first intercollegiate race of the season, MIT traveled to Williamstown, Massachusetts to race at the Williams College Purple Valley Classic.  The challenging, hilly course was made even more difficult by an 80 degree day without a cloud in the sky.  Of course, everyone had to deal with this, so the significance was just a matter of slower times.
    
    
                
    
    In the men's 8K race, a total of 19 teams competed, and of those, seven were among the top 35 teams in the country for Division III, led by number two Williams College.  MIT ranked 10th, RPI  (16th), Amherst College (19th), Middlebury College (22nd), Conn. College (34th) and St. Lawrence (35th) represented the other nationally ranked teams.  This is the first weekend where results might affect the decision on which teams are eventually selected for the NCAA Division III championship on an at-large basis, so the results actually matter beyond the race itself.
    
    
                
    
    MIT, depending primarily on freshmen, planned on being conservative and working together as a group.  Well that lasted for less than one mile as the group splintered.  The lead group for MIT, Andrew Mah '22, Sanjay Raman '23 and Cameron Kleiman '23 were among the top five at the mile mark, which was indeed a conservative 5:13.  Back a little at 5:15 were Lowell Hensgen '23, Vedang Lad '23 and Zach Johnson '22.  Steven Goldy '20 was right behind with a few more MIT runners.  While not in a group per se, they were feeding off the presence of each other.
    
    
                
    
    The men's course has a very long and challenging hill that must be done twice, once at the end of mile two and the second at the end of mile four.  After the first time up the hill the meet was pretty much decided.  MIT was in pretty good position with Raman in third, Mah in fifth, Kleiman in sixth and Hensgen and Johnson in 15th and 16th respectively, but Williams was literally running away with it at one, two, eight, nine and eleven, as well as six more in the top thirty.
    
    
                
    
    By the end, Aidan Ryan '21 of Williams won easily in 26:04, and Williams took the team title with a low score of 31, also claiming third, seventh, ninth and eleventh.  MIT claimed runner-up honors with a solid 56 points.  Mah finished fourth, Raman fifth, Kleiman sixth, Lad 19th and Hensgen 22nd.  MIT's total delta was only 39 seconds, but the 27 seconds between third and fourth runners is what hurt them.
    
    
                
    
    Of particular note, Mah, if taken out of the scoring, the five freshmen; Raman, Kleiman, Lad, Hensgen and Sam Acquaviva '23, who was 24th overall would have still earned second place as a team as third place RPI was back with 91 points.
    
    
                
    
    The women raced second and again there was a loaded field among the 14 teams.  Williams was ranked fourth nationally, MIT fifth, Tufts eighth, RPI 10th and Middlebury 19th.  The women's 6K race only had one repetition of the long hill, but that was enough on this hot day, particularly with the location being at the end of the third mile.
    
    
                
    
    After a start that was perhaps a little too strong, MIT settled in with Katie Collins '21 in the front group of three runners and the rest of MIT's chase group pretty far back.  Tufts was dominating the front of the pack and at the mile mark the score was Tufts 44, MIT 77 and Williams 107.  Middlebury and RPI also had a significant number of runners up in the front, but were not quite threatening the top three teams.
    
    
                
    
    After the two mile mark as they headed towards the large hill, Tufts was still in the lead, but had lost some ground with 53 points.  MIT had gained some of those points and seemed to be in position to take the victory after the hill as they were at 65 points.  Williams had moved up significantly to 79 points and perhaps their cautious approach was paying off.
    
    
                
    
    At the end, Collins fell off the lead, suffering a tough mental third mile, falling back to 12th overall.  Kirsi Rajagopal '23, continues to impress as the freshman consistently moved up in the race, finishing fourth overall in 23:26.  Tufts held on to win with 60 points, led by a 1-2 finish with rookie Sabrina Gornisiewicz taking first in 22:44.  Williams moved past MIT to finish in second with 68 points.  MIT faded only a few spots, but enough to finish with 72 points, 12 out of first.  
    
    
                
    
    MIT's delta of 43 seconds was far too much for a top nationally ranked team and 1:07 through seven runners will hurt them badly if they cannot fix it.  Going out a little too quickly and lacking the mental toughness from a total team perspective can be corrected, and will have to be if the team hopes to continue their 10 year string of finishing among the top six teams at nationals.
    
    
                
    
    Next weekend the Engineers fly to Louisville to compete in the Pre-Natonal, Greater Louisville Classic at Tom Sawyer Park.  Both the men and women are sure to be tested by many nationally ranked teams.
