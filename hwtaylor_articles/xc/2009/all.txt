    **Freshmen Dominate the Day**
    
    
                      
    
    **Varsity Run Down the Alumni**
    
    
                      
    
    September 6, 2009
    
    
                      
    
    The MIT Cross Country alumni showed up with strong numbers for the typically hot and humid conditions seen for the annual Alumni/ae meet. Last year, the alumni took it to the men, winning 20-35 and planned on doing so again. Fortunately, the freshmen on the team, along with Gihan Amarasiriwardena '10 and Andrew Erickson '11, did not fear the "Has-Beens" and caught their older brethren to win by a score of 23-32.
    
    
                      
    
    The women alumnae fielded a seven person team, and while on paper appeared to have a chance for victory, were not quite in condition for such a feat. Nevertheless, a spirited performance by Andrea Bradshaw '09, broke up an MIT sweep, and Karen Kinnaman '06, finished in seventh with a strong run. However there was not enough support to prevent the varsity from prevailing 16-45.
    
    
                      
    
    The women were first on this humid, 80 degree day. In order to prevent individuals on the team from racing too much and to give each person on the team a chance to be among the leaders, only half of the varsity members competed. Bradshaw took control of the pace, hoping the varsity members, without a single member of last year's top seven, would not follow her aggressive early pace. However, being more competitive than cautious, Brooke Johnson '13, Katy Gordon '10, and Katherine Eve '12 (who did compete at nationals in 2008 as an alternate) made chase, not allowing Bradshaw to gain a lead.
    
    
                      
    
    At the mile mark, coming through in 5:56, Johnson and Eve had a two second lead over Bradshaw and Gordon. By the two mile mark, even though the MIT trio slowed to a 6:30 pace on the hilly mile, Bradshaw slipped 17 seconds back and Gordon was now pushing the pace. Fifteen seconds back were Marie Burkland '13, Lauren Allen '13, and Sarah Sprague '13, working well together, with Kinnaman 14 seconds back and pushing hard to make up the ground. At the finish, Johnson pulled away from Gordon in the final stretch to win with a 19:25 performance. Gordon followed closely in 19:29 with Eve at 19:36. Burkland caught Bradshaw with a 6:19 final mile, the fastest in the field for that mile. Bradshaw stayed ahead of a fast closing Allen to claim fifth in 20:04 to Allen's 20:08. Kinnaman outsprinted Maggie Lloyd '12, by one second, 20:22 to 20:23. 
    
    
                      
    
    Closing out the alumnae scoring were Adrienne Bolger '09, Alisha Schor '07, Liz Walker '06, Shelly Manber '08 and Elizabeth Finn '09.
    
    
                      
    
    On the men's side, the sixteen competing alumni meant to make it two in a row. If talking their way to victory counted, the "Has-Beens" had the race in the bag. It is a good thing for the varsity that the freshmen simply do not know any better and decided not to mind their elders. 
    
    
                      
    
    At the mile mark, Eric Khatchadourian '06, Ethan Crain '96, and Yermie Cohen '09 were one second ahead of Amarasiriwardena, Jacob Young '13, and Kyle Hannon '13 with an opening mile of 5:19. One second back the alumni had Joe Roy-Mayhew '08 and Jake Ruzevick '09 to post an imposing top five around the three varsity runners. Eight seconds back a group of five varsity runners were sticking to the race plan.
    
    
                      
    
    The second mile, the first with Bear Cage Hill, saw an aggressive move by the varsity members with Hannon leading the way. Cohen was dropped a bit and Khatchadourian and Crain looked like they were trying to hold on. However, Roy-Mayhew was only three seconds back and Cohen and Ruzevick were still nine seconds ahead of the trailing varsity group. 
    
    
                      
    
    At the end of the third mile, Roy-Mayhew had made his move and was just ahead of Hannon and Amarasiriwardena. Khatchadourian was only two seconds back and doing his best not to get dropped. Young was two seconds behind "Khatch", having lost a little focus with the hard pace. Crain was still in contention, and even though Cohen had fallen back, he was still ahead of the varsity chase group. However, Logan Trimble '13, and Dmitrij Petters '13, were close behind, having already passed Ruzevick and Erickson was moving up quickly. The varsity had just pulled ahead 27 to 28. 
    
    
                      
    
    True to fashion, the race was won in the fourth mile. Hannon and Amarasiriwardena opened up a nine second lead on Roy-Mayhew and Young was with Khatchadourian, two seconds back. Crain was still in sixth overall, but Trimble passed Cohen and Petters and Erickson were only three seconds behind Cohen. The score with one mile to go was 23 to 33 in favor of the varsity. 
    
    
                      
    
    Nothing really changed at the finish. Hannon outkicked Amarasiriwardena for an impressive victory in 26:48. Roy-Mayhew just out-dueled Young to the finish line for third place. Crain maintained a three second lead over Trimble, and Cohen remained ahead of Erickson. Ruzevick closed out the scoring for the alumni as he moved up one place to make the final score 23-32.
    
    
                      
    
    Also representing the alumni in most impressive fashion were Terry Mcnatt '87, 28:24, Josh Feldman '97, 28:47, Tyler Abrams '09, 29:13, Rocco Repetski '08, 29:19, Chris Wong '08, 29:24, Bob Collins '82, 29:29, Matt Bieniosek '09, 29:40, Peter Mulligan '08, 30:06, Ian Driver '05, 31:20, and Sumner Brown '66, 35:22. Bob Walmsey '84, began the race but after a far too aggressive first mile, realized he needed something for another race this weekend and did not continue.
    
    
                      
    
    Next weekend, the other half of the men's and women's roster, minus a few runners, will travel to Saratoga Park in Saratoga Springs, NY to take on RPI and WPI in the annual Engineer's Cup.

    **Gatowski, Arumugam Have Outstanding Races**
    
    
                      
    
    September 26, 2009
    
    
                      
    
    MIT went across town to Franklin Park to race in the Codfish Bowl with only a handful of individuals, using only two of the top seven for the men and women respectively. The 65 degree temperatures were conducive to some outstanding performances and the Engineers took advantage. Despite the lack of their top runners, MIT showed their depth, placing third in the women's race with only five runners, scoring 129 points and fourth in the men's race with 96 points.
    
    
                      
    
    The women raced first. An aggressive pace was set by the ladies from Division I power, Stony Brook University, with the leaders going out in 5:18 for the first mile. Trailing pretty far behind, but nevertheless extremely fast for her, Alina Gatowski '11, flew through in 5:41, looking strong. The other four runners for MIT, Katherine Eve '12, Missy Showers '13, Alicia Kaestli '12, and Janice O'Brien '12, came through in 6:00 with O'Brien appearing not quite ready for her first race of the season.
    
    
                      
    
    The leaders slowed significantly, running over 6:00 for the second mile while Gatowski passed a lot of runners, splitting 11:48. Eve, Showers and Kaestli worked well together but lost another 20 seconds to Gatowski. O'Brien, having stomach problems, was losing ground fast.
    
    
                      
    
    In the final part of the race, Gatowski continued to pass people, placing seventh in a huge Franklin Park personal best of 18:30. Eve finished very strong, also moving up a lot to 16th place while Showers was right behind in her MIT debut with a 19:26 for 18th place. Kaestli finished in 25th place, losing a lot in the final mile. O'Brien continued to fade, racing nothing like she would if not sick, placing 71st.
    
    
                      
    
    The men ran a more sensibly paced race but not by much. Hemu Arumugam '10, and Dawit Zewdie '13, paced Tech with a 5:00 first mile. Richard Prevost '11, and Dmitrij Petters '13, followed in 5:05 while Stephen Serene '12, and Matt Weaver '12, ran a conservative 5:10. Adam Delton '13, John LaColla '12, and Logan Daum '11, brought up the rear for the Engineers in 5:16.
    
    
                      
    
    Arumugam raced an excellent race, moving up tremendously throughout the last four miles. By mile two he was in the top 15, splitting 10:15. Zewdie, fresh off his 25:41 race at UMass Dartmouth, tried to stay with Arumugam and succeeded through the second mile. Serene moved up well, closing to within two seconds of Petters and Prevost at 10:38. 
    
    
                      
    
    Arumugam broke Zewdie in the third mile and Serene moved past Petters and Prevost but all were running well. Arumugam continued to move up and speed up, splitting 5:13, 5:11 and 4:48 in the final three miles. Likewise Zewdie finished with a 4:57 and Serene a 4:56 to move up to finish 14th and 23rd respectively. Petters finished in 33rd with a 5:08 last mile while Prevost closed strong with a 4:53 after lackluster third and fourth miles. Delton came back very well after backing off way too much in the second mile, running 16:00 over the final three miles.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT heads north to Keene State College in Keene, NH where they will participate in a small invitational. The goal for this week is to just get everyone back from the colds and flu half the team has been suffering.

    **Sub-Varsity Women Sweep Emmanuel Invite**
    
    
                      
    
    **Men Are Much Improved**
    
    
                      
    
    October 16, 2009
    
    
                      
    
    Resting their top six runners, MIT's women, third ranked in the country, led by Katherine Eve '12, showed they are capable of stepping up and taking responsibility for the team when they swept the top five places at the fifth annual Emmanuel College Invitational at Franklin Park. The men, led by a rejuvenated Paul Welle '11, could not earn first place individually, but swept the next five places to earn the team victory.
    
    
                      
    
    Despite the very wet, somewhat muddy course, and the windy 45 degree temperatures, Eve led the way through a crisp 5:47 first mile along with teammate Tania Morimoto '12. Katy Gordon '11, was right behind at 5:49. Back a bit were Alicia Kaestli '12, and Lauren Allen '13, in 6:00. Even though there were 19 full teams, most of them were being careful and not going out too fast, so MIT was not being challenged very much. 
    
    
                      
    
    At the two mile mark, MIT was demonstrating their superiority on the course with Eve opening up a large lead over everyone but teammate Morimoto as they came through in an impressive 12:01 and 12:03. Gordon had fallen back but was still in third place at 12:26. Kaestli and Allen were back at 12:32 and 12:35 respectively. Eve continued to hammer the course, putting in a 6:09 third mile en route to finishing in a personal best of 18:50. Morimoto faded with a 6:27 but still ran a Franklin Park best of 19:16. Gordon tripped and fell during the third mile, breaking her glasses and having to stop due to her inability to see. Kaestli finished strong to finish in 19:40. Allen ran an excellent 19:54 for fourth place. With Gordon not finishing, the sweep was in jeopardy, but Juliann Lajoie '13, finished with a great 6:31 mile to move up to fifth place and finish in a Franklin Park best 20:06.
    
    
                      
    
    The men, resting their top two, as well as their number six runner, were looking to find out exactly who they were after last week's debacle. In this meet they were expecting similar competition encountered by the women's team, so when freshman Dawit Zewdie, went out in 4:55, he was probably surprised to see Greg Redfield, from Johnson & Wales College, right beside him.  Teammates Bill Phipps '10, and Dan Harper '12, were right behind in 4:57. Just behind them were Ben Mattocks '12, and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11. Following a safe distance back were Paul Welle '11, and Stephen Serene '12, in 5:05.
    
    
                      
    
    Mile two saw MIT's top five runners separate themselves from the rest of the field, and Welle, running an excellent 5:20 split, had moved up to fourth with Amarasiriwardena, just five seconds behind Zewdie, who was not having any success pulling away from Redfield. In the third mile, Welle and Serene took over the top two spots for MIT, but could not catch Redfield. Phipps and Mattocks had moved into fourth and fifth place with Zewdie hanging onto sixth.
    
    
                      
    
    In the fourth mile the positions were pretty much set with the exception of Zewdie continuing to fade due to some severe intestinal cramps he had been suffering since the first mile, and Amarasiriwardena and Harper moving up. Welle was only three seconds back of first at the four mile mark and looked to be ready to make a move. However, even though he pushed hard, Welle finished nine seconds out of first in 26:11. Serene closed well, running 26:14 for third place. Phipps had the fastest final mile for the Engineers and finished one second back of Serene in 26:15. Mattocks finished fifth in 26:21 and Amarasiriwardena out kicked Cusick from Lesley College in the end to secure sixth place, giving MIT 20 points. Many MIT runners ran season and personal bests despite the weather and course conditions, righting the ship so to speak.
    
    
                      
    
    The next meet for MIT, and last one before the NCAA New England Regional meet is the NEWMAC Championships on 10/31, a meet the MIT men have never lost and one the women have won the past two years. The conference championship will be hosted by Wellesley College at Franklin Park with the men racing at 11:00 and the women at noon. Despite being favorites, the Engineers have a lot to work on as they prepare for the post season.

    **Gatowski and Arumugam Lead Engineer's to Victory**
    
    
                      
    
    September 12, 2009
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's women's cross country team led off the intercollegiate season for the Engineers in the appropriately named Engineer's Cup, hosted by RPI at Saratoga Springs State Park. MIT entered the meet with only six of their 21 runners, racing only those who did not race last weekend with the exception of Katy Gordon '11. Nevertheless, the Engineers patiently followed the game plan to win convincingly with a score os 22 to RPI's 40 and WPI's 69. 
    
    
                      
    
    Marie Ferro, a freshman from RPI, took out the pace pretty hard, leading a trio of MIT runners as well as a few of her teammates through the mile in 6:02. Tania Morimoto '12, went after Ferro, while Alina Gatowski '11, and Gordon, were holding position.
    
    
                      
    
    At mile two, Morimoto had taken a slight lead with a 6:05 split while Gatowski had closed the gap to within six seconds and Gordon had fallen back a bit. Chandler Burfield '13 and Alex Westbrook '13 started to close on the RPI trailing runners and were only 20 seconds behind Gordon. Alicia Kaestli '12, trailed her teammates by four seconds.
    
    
                      
    
    Gatowski made an incredible surge in the final mile, taking over the lead to win by 18 seconds in a final time of 18:36 for the hilly three mile race. Morimoto held on to outkick Ferro, and Burfield closed in a 6:23 to claim fifth place, just six seconds ahead of Gordon in sixth. Westbrook finished in eighth and Kaestli ninth.
    
    
                      
    
    The men took to the wet course next. Also running only those who did not race last weekend, the Tech man nevertheless had a strong group of runners. Not having lost the meet since 1990, Tech was not about to lose now. With a great final two miles the Engineers pulled out a 25 to 39 victory over RPI with WPI coming in with 66 points. 
    
    
                      
    
    At the mile mark the MIT harriers were a little surprised to be trailing RPI. The first mile was in 5:17 with two RPI runners and Hemu Arumugam '11, Paul Welle '11, and Bill Phipps '10, representing MIT in the lead pack. The next pack of MIT runners were behind a large group of RPI runners, who looked very comfortable with the pace.
    
    
                      
    
    Nothing really changed until the third mile when Phipps began to fall back. There was now only one RPI runner doing battle with Arumugam and Welle with one WPI runner closing on Phipps. RPI was winning the race at this point and looked quite strong due to their three through six runners still ahead of MIT's fourth runner. 
    
    
                      
    
    Mile four saw a surge by Ben Mattocks '12, and Stephen Serene '12 and a recovery by Phipps. Arumugam and Welle were doing battle with the RPI runner with no one able to break the other. At the end of mile four MIT was now up 32 to 36.
    
    
                      
    
    Arumugam pulled away at the finish to win in 26:43, a fine time at this time of year on such a challenging course. Welle held onto third place in 27:02 and Phipps finished in fifth place in 27:13. Mattocks continued to move up, claiming seventh place in 27:24 with Serene close behind in ninth at 27:35. Freshman Dawit Zewdie had an excellent final two miles to place 16th in 27:51.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT will run nearly everyone on their team in the UMass Dartmouth Invitational. This should provide the Engineers with a better picture of where they stand in the New England Region as many of the top teams are expected to run in the meet.

    **Hannon and Showers Lead the Way For MIT**
    
    
                      
    
    **MIT Runs Hard, but Fails to Compete**
    
    
                      
    
    October 3, 2009 
    
    
                      
    
    The rain held off, the course was flat and the temperatures mild, but MIT left their competitive instincts at home, failing to defeat any of the teams ranked ahead of them in the New England rankings, and in fact, losing to two on the women's side in the 15th annual Keene State Invitational. The women, led by Missy Showers '13, finished third out of 12 teams with 90 points, falling to a very talented Amherst College team with 25 points and host Keene State with 85. The men, led by Kyle Hannon '13, finished fifth out of 11 teams with 114 points, far behind host Keene State with 44, Dartmouth College with 65, Amherst with 69 and Southern Maine with 70. 
    
    
                      
    
    MIT did not run their top five women, but still had the expectation to challenge for the victory. However, the Engineers, all freshmen and sophomores, did not get out well, finding themselves far behind the front runners. With plenty of time after everyone settled in, the lady Engineers still did not move. Only Tania Morimoto '11, challenged the front runners with a 5:55 first mile on the wet course. The rest of the MIT pack were back at 6:20, virtually giving up any chance of victory. Showers, Marie Burkland '13, Chandler Burfield '13, Lauren Allen '13, and Maggie Lloyd '12, moved up through the waves of runners in the second and third miles but were unable to catch Keene State, who were missing one of their top runners and had another top runner twist an ankle and drop out during the race. Showers ended up catching a fading Morimoto in the final half mile, finishing in 13 place in 19:34. Morimoto struggled to the line in 19:44, losing nine seconds in just the final tenth of a mile. Burkland finished in 21st in 19:50 and was followed by Burfield and Allen in 22nd and 23rd place respectively, both timed in 19:54.
    
    
                      
    
    You would think the men would learn from watching the women make the mistake of getting out too cautiously, but they turned around and made the exact same mistake. Only holding out two of their top five, MIT was expecting to give Keene State a run for the title. At least that was Coach Halston Taylor's expectation, if not the teams. 
    
    
                      
    
    Even though MIT was pretty far behind the leaders, they were still within striking distance at 5:08 for the top four and had four more miles to get it done. However, instead of moving up on the leaders, MIT slowed to 5:22 pace and only Hannon broke 5:20 for any of the final four miles. It just appeared they were spectators that were comfortable with their seat and did not want to move.
    
    
                      
    
    Hannon, out for nearly three weeks with a severe cold or flu, showed his spirit by trying to move up and succeeding at catching many of his competitors, finishing in 13th place with a 26:29. Dan Harper '12, completed the five miles in 26:49 in 22nd place. Bill Phipps '10, finished in 24th with a time of 26:55. Jacob Young '13, nursing a lower leg soreness placed 27th in 27:09 and Gihan Amarasiriwardena was 33rd in 27:15. 
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT hopes to rebound and show what they are made of in the All New England Championships at Franklin Park with the first race at noon.

    ENGINEERS CLAIM FIFTH AT NATIONALS
    
    
                      
    
    Maria Monks and Jacqui Wentz Lead the Way With All America Honors
    
    
                      
    
    November 21, 2009 
    
    
                      
    
    You know you have a team accustomed to success when placing fifth at the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championship is a disappointment. That is exactly what happened to the Engineers from MIT on the course hosted by Baldwin Wallace College in Cleveland, Ohio.
    
    
                      
    
     Seeded third going into the meet, MIT, co-winners of the New England Region Championship the week before, did not get out well at the start, finding themselves behind over 200 runners as the course narrowed after a little over 200 meters. Running out of box 46, the furthest outside box and downhill from those boxes on the other side of the split start, Tech failed to compensate for the uphill start, misjudging as they were not able to see across the field for their opponents. 
    
    
                      
    
    Realizing their error, most of the Engineers worked hard to get around the mass of runners. Maria Monks '10, was the best at this as she angled across and fought her way towards the leaders. Monks came through the mile in 5:36 to lead MIT at that point. Jacqui Wentz '10, last week's regional winner, has been dealing with a severe case of plantar fasciitis and the start really hurt, making it difficult to run up on the ball of her foot. Nevertheless she was only two seconds back of Monks at the mile. The next three MIT runners, Alina Gatowski '11, Tania Morimoto '12, and Brooke Johnson '13, were between six and eight seconds back of Wentz, which at the mile mark was about 100 runners.
    
    
                      
    
    At two miles, Monks had moved up to ninth place and looked to be still running strong on the slippery and soggy course. Wentz was around the mid 20's but did not look to be gaining any ground. The soft ground from all the rain was further compounding her foot pain. Gatowski was up around 60th place while Morimoto and Johnson were around 90th position. Missy Showers '13, and Katherine Eve '12, were six and eight seconds behind Johnson respectively at this point and not looking as though they were moving up. At this point however it was reported via the chip system that MIT was in second place.
    
    
                      
    
    With three quarters of a mile to go, the Engineers began to fade a bit as the course turned uphill. Tech runners had worked so hard moving up from the poor start that the final uphill took its toll. Last week, on a very difficult course, the Engineers had run with a 1:01 delta for runners one through five, the largest delta of the season. This week it was 1:29 with 17 seconds coming in the final three quarters of a mile.
    
    
                      
    
    Monks held onto 13th place, the highest national finish ever for the Lady Engineers. Wentz earned her first cross country All America honor by placing 29th despite her injury. Gatowski ran a gallant race, finishing in 51st place. Morimoto and Johnson suffered a difficult last mile, finishing in 127th and 144th respectively. 
    
    
                      
    
    The fifth place finish marks the highest national finish for male or female cross country teams from MIT. The hard fought finish made the Engineers that much more hungry to return and improve on their mark in 2010.

    **Wentz Claims First to Lead MIT to Share of New England Title**
    
    
                      
    
    **Men and Women Have Superb Performances at NCAA Regional Qualifier**
    
    
                      
    
    November 14, 2009
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's Men's and Women's Cross Country teams traveled to Cumberland, Maine to participate in the NCAA Division III New England Regional Cross Country Championship hosted by the University of Southern Maine at Twin Brooks Recreation Center this weekend, and left with an individual champion in Jacqui Wentz '10, a tie for the women's title with 63 points, an inspiring sixth place finish by the men's team with 163 points and a total of eight All-New England runners.
    
    
                      
    
    The already challenging course (the most difficult all year for MIT) was made much worse by the rain that had begun to fall minutes before the start of the women's race. 
    
    
                      
    
    The women, ranked fourth in NCAA Division III, went into the meet with a great opportunity to win despite the fact that fifth ranked Middlebury College was the defending national champion and seventh ranked Williams College, had finished third at the national championship last year. MIT had defeated both teams back in mid October in the NEICAAA Championship. 
    
    
                      
    
    The start of the race could not have been better for MIT. While most of the field sprinted off the line, MIT's harriers got out well and used the entire slightly uphill quarter mile plus to get to the front of the pack. By 1 1/2 miles, the Engineers were in 1-2-4-5 with a nice breakaway from the next pack, which was three seconds back. At the two mile mark, the lead group was down to three; Wentz, Maria Monks '10, and Ravenna Neville from Wesleyan, coming through in 11:40. Alina Gatowski '11, and Tania Morimoto '12, were six seconds back in the next small pack. Brooke Johnson '13, had begun to fall back after being just four seconds off of Gatowski and Morimoto at the mile mark, now running 13 seconds behind. 11 more seconds back were Katherine Eve '12 and Missy Showers '13. At three miles, the lead group of three were still in control, coming through at 17:39. The trail group was now 16 seconds back with Gatowski  in that group. Morimoto had begun to tire, losing 17 seconds to Gatowski. Eve had a great third mile, moving up to a fading Johnson in 18:23. The final three quarters of a mile on the 6000 meter course was a fast one, particularly for Wentz, who pulled away with a 3:58 final .73 to win by four seconds in 21:35. Neville earned second place while Monks finished in third in 21:44. 
    
    
                      
    
    A mad finish to the line for the six through 10 runners, included Gatowski and a bit of controversy. The four runners finished within .4 of a second of each other so the Finish Lynx cameras were used to determine whose torso crossed first. Ankle chips are used in the championships to determine the order of finish, but since the ankle is not the  part of the body recorded for an official finish, when it is that close, the photo finish results are used. Gatowski was originally awarded ninth place and the unofficial results were posted with Middlebury College winning the championship by one point. While they were pleased they had run so well and qualified for nationals, the Tech women were a little down. When the results were changed to Gatowski earning eighth place, it put MIT and Middlebury in a tie, which in college, cannot be broken. This change of results left the MIT women quite excited and preserved a sweep of all New England Division III Championships in 2009 for MIT; indoor, outdoor and cross country.
    
    
                      
    
    Eve finished with an excellent final 1.75 miles to move up to 24th place in 22:32. Morimoto held onto 27th place with Johnson making a bit of a comeback to earn 28th place. Showers did not have a banner day, finishing in 55th position.
    
    
                      
    
    Despite the difficulty of the hills, turns and mud on the course, all of MIT's runners ran 6K personal bests and most came through the 5K at or near their personal best, with all of the top five under 19:00 at 5K. 
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's men's team had not performed up to their potential all year. Week after week, the Engineers were ranked in the bottom of the top ten teams in New England Division III. With the workouts going better than ever and the health of the team pretty sound, with one exception, MIT's top seven were planning to put it together on this very wet and muddy day.
    
    
                      
    
    The start was very similar to the women's with MIT getting a great position without having to work too hard up the hill. At the mile mark, Hemu Arumugam '10, was up towards the front in the top 15 with a 5:01 mile. Bill Phipps '10, was close behind in 5:03. A bit farther back were Paul Welle '11 and Kyle Hannon '13, in 5:07. Still in good position, but in the rear for MIT, were Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, Dan Harper '12, and Dawit Zewdie '13, in 5:10. The only change for the second mile was Hannon dropping back from an aggravation with his IT band.
    
    
                      
    
    In the third and fourth miles, Arumugam lost a couple places, but Welle moved up a few places and was only three seconds in back of his teammate in 20:55 at the end of mile four. Amarasiriwardena was also running very well and had moved into the top 45. Phipps had been fading a bit in these two miles but was still MIT's fourth man. Harper was running consistently and looked pretty fresh at the four mile mark. Zewdie, whose stomach had been giving him problems during races for the latter half of the season, was again having problems and had dropped back.
    
    
                      
    
    At the finish, Arumugam was timed in 25:59 for 20th place. Right behind in a season personal best of 26:03, was Welle. Amarasiriwardena, who was only four seconds off his best, which was run on a flat, fast course, was 37th in 26:22. Harper ran a 5:01 final mile to move up a lot and finish 41st in 26:26. Just behind, and finishing fifth for MIT and 44th overall, was Phipps in 26:28. 
    
    
                      
    
    The sixth place finish with 163 points for the men was an excellent ending to the season. They defeated two nationally ranked teams, in Southern Maine and Tufts, as well as finishing just 10 points out of fifth and a possible NCAA Championship birth. The men, in fact, were only 31 points out of third place in the 48 team field.
    
    
                      
    
    MIT was supported by a tremendous following of alumni and current teammates. Many of the alumni came quite a distance to support the Engineers' effort. MIT's women will compete in the NCAA Division III Championship race on Saturday, November 21st, at Highland Hills Golf Course, Highland Hills, Ohio. The meet is hosted by Baldwin-Wallace College.

    MIT Women Live up to Expectations - Wentz Leads Team to Fourth Place 
    
    
                      
    
    **MIT Places in Top Five Among All Divisions in New England in Three of Four Races**
    
    
                      
    
    October 10, 2009
    
    
                      
    
    MIT's women's cross country team, the fourth ranked team in the country for Division III, was not certain they deserved such a ranking, but they were intent on finding out. The Engineers competed in the All Division New England (NEICAAA) Championship at Franklin Park. Despite the slow times produced due to the rain soaked course and the high winds, MIT raced to the level of expectations, placing fourth overall and first among Division III teams.
    
    
                      
    
    Of the four races; men's and women's varsity (top 7) and sub-varsity, MIT placed in the top five in three of the four races, earning fifth in the women's sub-varsity race and a very nice fourth in the men's sub-varsity race. The only race that went horribly wrong for Tech was the men's varsity, suffering through the worst finish in the history of the program with a 29th place finish.
    
    
                      
    
    With over 300 runners in each of four races and 42 and 49 varsity teams in the men's and women's varsity races respectively, the key to success on the soft course with a sharp turn less than 300 meters into the race, was to get out. The three successful MIT teams accomplished this feat, the men's varsity did not.
    
    
                      
    
    In the women's varsity race, Maria Monks '10, led the way across the field, perhaps a little too fast, but she was very concerned about getting trapped in the back and was probably a little nervous, just having arrived at Franklin Park 25 minutes prior to her race due to having to take the GRE exam in the morning. The rest of the varsity got out well with the exception of Katherine Eve '12, who was not feeling well. Despite the soft ground, the first mile split was quite fast. Jacqui Wentz '10, and Monks were with the leaders in 5:32. Alina Gatowski '11, was a bit back in 48th place at the mile in 5:38. Brooke Johnson '13, out a little too quickly, was just two seconds back. Missy Showers '13, was back at about 85th position in 5:45 along with Tania Morimoto '12.
    
    
                      
    
    By the two mile mark, Wentz was in fourth, six seconds behind the two leaders, Cory Conner from University of Maine and Ari Garber from Brown, and a few feet behind Laura Brustolon of Southern Connecticut. Monks had fallen back to 14th with Gatowski in 42nd place. Showers had moved up to 66th place but Johnson fell back to 71st. In the final mile, Wentz had pulled away from Brustolon and was catching Garber but made her move too late to do so, finishing in 18:06, the fastest time ever for an MIT runner at Franklin Park. Monks dropped back to 20th place in 18:24, a Franklin Park personal best. Gatowski only dropped five more places but could have easily been up with Monks if she had more experience in these races. Showers moved up a couple of spots to secure 63rd place in 19:01. Johnson never really regained her focus, ending up in 19:17 in 84th place. This gave MIT a total of 217 points, only 16 points behind Dartmouth, and only 25 points ahead of rival Williams College in seventh place. The women have achieved a great accomplishment but there is still work to do.
    
    
                      
    
    The men's varsity race could not have been more different than the women's, at least not as far as MIT was concerned. The Engineers did not get out well, poorly managing the start and getting squeezed from both sides, ending up behind over 150 runners after the first 300 meters. Bill Phipps '10, was the first MIT runner to pass through the mile mark and he was back in 80th place at 4:53. Hemu Arumugam '10, Dawit Zewdie '13, and Kyle Hannon '13, were back around 120th in 4:57. Dan Harper '12, Ben Mattocks '12, and Jacob Young '13, were even further back at around 150th in 5:01. Clearly they were already out of the race. 
    
    
                      
    
    Mile two saw some improvement with Arumugam and Hannon catching up to Phipps, with all of them moving up in the mid 70s. Zewdie was now in 89th position but still looking pretty good. Harper had not moved, still around 146th place. Mattocks and Young actually lost ground to 160th and 206th places respectively.
    
    
                      
    
    Mile three may be the most unfortunate cross country mile ever experienced by an MIT squad. First, Young, already suffering a poor race, lost his shoe at around two and a half miles. Then coming down Bear Cage Hill, just before the three mile mark, Phipps falls down and decides to quit the race. Hannon strains his hamstring, falling four times and unable to run without limping. With only four runners remaining plus Young with one shoe and falling back, Tech was not looking at a very rosy picture. Arumugam continued to move up while Zewdie began to move back. Harper was moving up slightly and Mattocks was holding steady while Young continued to fall back. The end result was Arumugam finishing in 44th place in 25:40. Zewdie held on for 105th, Harper 127th, Mattocks 157th and Young back in 248th place. 
    
    
                      
    
    In the sub-varsity races, MIT competed pretty well. Marie Burkland '13 and Katy Gordon '11, led the way for the women. Burkland competed very well, finishing in 16th place with a 19:21. Gordon ran well but could have run with Burkland had she not gone out so fast and focused a bit better. As it was she finished in 22nd place with a 19:30. Alicia Kaestli '12, ran 19:42 for 28th place, Lauren Allen '13, ran 20:02 for 44th place while Maggie Lloyd '12, rounded out the top five with a 20:07 for 48th place and a well earned fifth place as a team. Only Williams College finished ahead of MIT among Division III teams.
    
    
                      
    
    Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, led the way for MIT in the men's sub-varsity race. Amarasiriwardena was up with the leaders from the start, running in 15th place at the mile mark and finishing in eighth with a 26:26 time. Stephen Serene '12, a much improved sophomore, stayed in around the mid 20s for position, finishing in 26th place. Paul Welle '11, unable to duplicate his former performances, went out the fastest of all MIT runners, going through the half mile in 2:23 and the mile in 4:52. However, this must have been too fast for Welle on this day as he progressively slowed as the race proceeded, although he held onto 32nd place. Rounding out the top five were Logan Trimble '13, and Richard Prevost '11, in 43rd and 47th place with times of 27:04 and 27:06 respectively. The fourth place as a team was a nice performance. Again, only Williams among Division III teams finished ahead of MIT. 
    
    
                      
    
    MIT seemed a little beat up on the men's side while racing very well on the women's side. Three weeks remains before the NEWMAC Conference Championship and five weeks before the NCAA Regional qualifier. There is plenty of time for both teams to be at their best when it really counts.

    **Monks and Arumugam Lead MIT Cross Country Teams to Conference Titles**
    
    
                      
    
    **Women Set Record of Fewest Points in Conference History With 18**
    
    
                      
    
    October 31, 2009 
    
    
                      
    
    The men had won every NEWMAC Cross Country Championship since the inception of the conference in 1998. The women had won the past two NEWMAC Championships, dominating a little more the second year. Neither team was planning on relinquishing their hold on the championship trophies and neither did. The men won with a score of 24 points to runner-up Springfield's 41. The women took no prisoners, taking the race from the start and finishing with a total of 18 points, a meet record. 
    
    
                      
    
    Both the men and women were looking for fast times since it was their final time on the Franklin Park course in 2009. However, the wet month of October combined with the high number of races on the course and not enough warm days, left a very wet and mushy course that gave the runners nothing in return. In addition the 75 degree temperatures and 40 mph winds meant a day to race and disregard time.
    
    
                      
    
    The men raced first, and predictably, the first mile was slow as Hemu Arumugam '10, Kyle Hannon '13, and Brian Fuller of Springfield came through in 5:01. MIT had a tight pack right behind, between 5:03-5:06, with the rest of the field trailing. 
    
    
                      
    
    By the second mile, Fuller had taken a small lead. The MIT pack had spread out and the Springfield runners had started to catch up a bit. In the third mile Hannon had started vomiting and was obviously falling back. Arumugam and Fuller now had an 18 second lead over Bill Phipps '10 and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11. The second Springfield runner was nine seconds back with Paul Welle '11. The next Springfield runner was 16 seconds back, behind four more MIT runners and two Coast Guard runners.
    
    
                      
    
     During the Wilderness Loop in the fourth mile, Arumugam put on a big surge to open up an eight second lead. Phipps was still in third, 23 seconds back with Amarasiriwardena within three seconds of his teammate. However, Springfield's second runner was now only seven seconds down and their third runner had passed five runners to move into seventh place. Hannon was falling back fast and Welle had also begun to fade. Fortunately for MIT, Springfield's fourth and fifth runners were back in 14th and 21st place. 
    
    
                      
    
    The final mile continued the trend of the top Springfield runners moving up. Arumugam won in 25:50, 11 seconds ahead of Fuller. The number two Springfield runner passed Amarasiriwardena and their third runner passed Dan Harper '12, for sixth. All of the top six Springfield runners are underclassmen while MIT loses their top two. This should give the MIT runners something to think about for next year. 
    
    
                      
    
    The Tech women were supposed to go out hard and simply run away with the race. After watching the men struggle with that philosophy, the women decided to back off the pace just a little. The first mile was a more reasonable 5:47. In that lead group were Jacqui Wentz '10, Maria Monks '10, Alina Gatowski '11 and Amanda DiPaolo from Springfield. Behind them were one runner from Smith and one from Wellesley. Five seconds behind MIT's A group was the B group of Brooke Johnson '13, Missy Showers '13, Tania Morimoto '12, Katherine Eve '12, Katy Gordon '11 and Marie Burkland '13.
    
    
                      
    
    In the second mile, Monks pushed the pace, surprising Wentz, and opening up an eight second lead on Wentz. DiPaolo was 15 seconds behind Wentz. Gatowksi, still recovering from a cold earlier in the week, fell way back. Morimoto pushed the second mile  and was only three seconds back of DiPaolo. Showers, Gatowski and Johnson were seven seconds behind Morimoto when they should have been with her. Burkland dropped out due to an anterior tibialis injury and Gordon, who was not able to handle the pace, had fallen back with the failing Wellesley and Smith runners. 
    
    
                      
    
    The final eleven tenths had Monks pulling off a 13 second victory over Wentz in 18:32, an excellent performance given the conditions. DiPaolo finished 24 seconds behind Wentz. MIT then brought in the next four runners led by Johnson in 19:20. Following were Showers, Morimoto and Gatowski. Similar to the guys, MIT graduates its top two runners, but along with the rest of the young team that put 10 runners ahead of second place Wellesley's fifth runner, MIT has a stable of very good freshmen who were taken out of the season early to make sure their pre existing injuries have plenty of time to heal. MIT hopes to be even stronger next year. 
    
    
                      
    
    In two weeks the Engineers travel to the Twin Brooks Cross Country course in Cumberland, ME for the NCAA New England Regional Championship. The top two teams receive automatic advancement to the NCAA Division III Cross Country Championships hosted by Baldwin Wallace College in Cleveland, OH.

    **MIT Wins Three of Four Races at UMass Dartmouth Invitational**
    
    
                      
    
    **Wentz Leads Way With 17:40**
    
    
                      
    
    September 19, 2009
    
    
                      
    
    MIT took advantage of the best race day weather so far this season, winning three of four races at the UMass Dartmouth Invitational. The 65-70 degree sunny day with strong winds made for excellent racing  on the flat course. 
    
    
                      
    
    Individual victories highlighted each of the team victories. Marie Burkland '13, started things off with a 19:03 PR, leading the sub-varsity ladies to a perfect 15 point score among the 21 complete teams. Next, Jacqui Wentz '10, raced to a 17:40 PR to lead the varsity to a 60 point victory over 41 other teams. In the final race of the day, Dawit Zewdie '13, ran a two minute PR, racing to a 25:40 to win the sub-varsity 8K race and lead the team to victory with 41 points to beat out 17 other teams.
    
    
                      
    
    In the women's sub-varsity race, Alex Westbrook '13, took the pace out a little too hard in 6:01 at the mile mark, but Burkland along with Alicia Kaestli '12, and Lauren Allen '13 were right behind her. By the two mile mark, Burkland had taken a commanding lead at 12:15 and the MIT women were uncharacteristically spread out but claiming the top five places. During the third mile, Burkland continued to pull away as she put in another 6:13 effort. Kaestli, who had fallen off the pace in the second mile, caught back up to Westbrook and passed her at the finish. A runner from Brandeis, which did not field a complete team, moved past both of them with a vicious final mile to claim second overall. Allen ran 19:30 to claim fifth and Lloyd moved up very well after a more practical first mile of 6:10 to finish in 19:31. Also running well and claiming eighth and ninth in the race respectively were Juliann Lajoie '13, Sarah Sprague '13. The domination by MIT certainly says a lot about the future for MIT.
    
    
                      
    
    The women's varsity race was next and they wasted little time establishing their position. Wentz went out strong in 5:39, about 10 meters off the leaders at the mile mark. The varsity ladies did not follow the plan at all, stringing themselves out right away due to a couple of them being stopped by a fallen runner right in front of them. With 301 runners in the field the quickly narrowing course made it difficult to advance, but the Tech runners raced very well despite being strung out. Maria Monks '10, ran her plan by hitting the mile in 5:45. Freshman, Brooke Johnson '13, suffering from an aching back, ignored the pain and went out in 5:49, causing the others in her group to play catchup. By the two mile mark, Wentz had taken the lead as she came through the mark in 11:25. Monks had moved up to fifth and Alina Gatowski '11, had moved up just behind Johnson. Wentz went on to win by 19 seconds with a 17:40 for the 5K, the fastest time ever for an MIT cross country runner for the 5K. Monks finished well but remained in fifth in 18:08. Gatowski passed Johnson in the final straight as they finished 10th and 11th respectively in 18:31 and 18:32. Chandler Burfield '13, had a great race after her initial delayed start, running 19:14 for 32nd place. Many MIT runners were missing from a bout of flu that hit the campus and a couple others were not ready to race due to early season training breaks. The depth and quality of the women's team makes this team one to be watched on the NCAA Division III front.
    
    
                      
    
    The men's varsity race was next. The men have a young and talented team but are being brought around slowly. They also were missing quite a few runners due to the flu, including top freshman, Kyle Hannon. Hemu Arumugam '10, led the way for MIT through the entire race, starting off with a 5:04 first mile. The rest of the varsity, Dan Harper '12, Jacob Young '13, Ben Mattocks '12, Bill Phipps '10, Paul Welle '11, and Gihan Amarasiriwardena '11, were just one to two seconds back running in a tight pack. By the two mile mark, Arumugam had distanced himself from his teammates, coming through in 10:14. Welle and Phipps were fairly close with the others about five seconds back. Arumugam then threw down a 5:07 on the slightly uphill third mile and a 4:44 coming down the same hill to move up into the top 10 runners. Harper Young, Mattocks and Phipps faded quite a bit in the third mile and were not able to capitalize as much on the downhill mile as they should have been able to. Finishing strong, Arumugam claimed seventh place in a personal best of 25:05. Harper, running his first race of the season, finished in 30th in 25:35. Young, Mattocks and Phipps were close behind, claiming 35th, 38th and 39th in 25:45, 25:47 and 25:48, all fine times for the 8K course. The varsity men claimed sixth place with 145 points, finishing behind three other division III teams and two division II teams. 
    
    
                      
    
    In the final race, the Engineers showed their dominance right from the start. Andrew Erickson '12, coming off a bad cold, led Zewdie, Logan Trimble '13, Stephen Serene '12 and Richard Prevost '11, through a 5:09-5:11 first mile. By mile two Zewdie was among the front group of runners along with Trimble and Serene. Prevost and Erickson, feeling the effects of his illness, fell back by a few seconds but others were beginning to move up. Nothing changed significantly during the uphill third mile, but in the downhill fourth mile, Zewdie and one other runner had separated themselves from the pack with a 4:49 split. Along with Trimble and Serene making strong moves, Jack Bourbonnais '10, and Matt Weaver '12 were passing a lot of people. In the final mile, Zewdie opened up a nice four second lead to win in 25:40. Trimble finished in 26:12 for fifth place and Serene was right behind him in sixth place in 26:13. Bourbonnais continued to move up, placing 12th in 26:37. Weaver ran a nice PR of 26:50 to claim 17th place, just one place ahead of Prevost in 26:52. Freshmen Pat Marx and David Way, 400-800 runners in track, ran extremely well, placing 20th and 21st in 26:55 and 26:56 respectively.
    
    
                      
    
    Next week, MIT will again split their squad at the Codfish Bowl Invitational at Franklin Park. Hopefully, those suffering from the flu will be back and ready to race.
